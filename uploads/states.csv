Democrats are ending their bid to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth, excising one of the most controversial revenue-raising ideas they’ve pursued this session.
The proposal, embedded in House Bill 2409, seeks to allow an increase in the growth factor from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation within a taxing district, not to exceed 3%. This would apply to the state’s common schools levy and for cities and counties, as well as special purpose districts.
A fiscal analysis projected that uncapping the state property tax would net an additional $200 million for public schools and potentially $236 million for local governments in the next budget. The bill passed the House Finance Committee on Saturday and is expected to be voted on by the House today.
But Rep. Steve Bergquist, D-Renton, the bill’s sponsor, filed an amendment Sunday to remove sections on the growth limit, effectively ending Democrats’ pursuit of the change.
“It’s my understanding we don’t have a three-corners agreement on those provisions,” Bergquist said Monday morning.
Three-corners refers to the Democratic leadership of the House, Senate and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Without the property tax change, the bill will be focused on education funding and providing school districts with the ability to collect more revenue from voter-approved local levies.
From the outset of the session — now just six days from ending — Democrats’ desire to increase the limit has been fiercely opposed by Republican lawmakers and taxpayers who warned the measure would drive up living and housing costs.
A year ago, Senate Democrats pushed to erase the cap solely for cities and counties. It too ran into a buzzsaw of opposition, forcing the majority party to set it down.

Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.

The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”

‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.

Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period. Alabama has 69,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in 2000.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

It’s been nearly two years since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced a group of 16 individuals would each face several felonies carrying years of potential prison time for what she said was an undermining of the public’s faith in elections and a flagrant violation of the law.
According to investigators, after Trump lost Michigan to former President Joe Biden in 2020 by about 150,000 votes in the presidential race, 16 individuals from across the state met in the basement of the Michigan Republican Party’s Lansing headquarters on Dec. 14, 2020. There investigators say the group signed and submitted false documents contending they were the rightful slate of electors for Michigan. Those affidavits were then submitted to the United States Senate and National Archives.

The case has been lengthy, with a state judge hearing out the defense and prosecution of 15 defendants after the state dropped the case against one of the defendants.

24-1132_Documents 
Arguments from the defense have ranged from the group’s right to political protest to their actions being a lawful maneuver in the event that the 2020 election results be overturned.
The defense of multiple individuals in the group have taken particular issue with Nessel’s own comments surrounding the case, notably statements she made during a virtual event in September of 2023 where she said the group was “brainwashed” by Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen from him.
“These are people who have been brainwashed,” Nessel said in the video. “They legit believe that … somebody can’t even plead guilty if they wanted to because they can’t admit that what they did violated the law because they still think they’re right.”
The defense team for one member of the group, Clifford Frost of Warren, argued that Nessel and her office are engaged in a “bad faith” case against the defendants, requesting at the end of 2023 that a federal judge intervene in the case. In January of 2024, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker rejected the defense’s arguments, declining to intercede, saying a proper argument had not been made to support the “bad faith” contention.
Frost’s attorney, Kevin Kijewski, has argued that there was no criminal intent in what the state is alleging, adding that the defendants signed their own real names to the documents in an act of political protest.
However, on Thursday, a panel of judges in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Jonker’s decision to stay out of the state’s case. The appeal to the lower court’s decision was set before Judges Eric L. Clay, Judge Helene N. White and Judge John B. Nalbandian, a Trump appointee.
The opinion, penned by Clay, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, outlines that Frost’s defense does not call into question the state court’s competency to consider the challenges that have been made to the validity of the criminal charges he faces.
“…we must ‘assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary,’” the opinion reads. “In addition, Frost’s qualms with the adequacy of the State’s charging documents do not automatically convert his prosecution into a product of bad faith. This is particularly so where, as here, state court remains a viable forum for the consideration of Frost’s arguments.”
Preliminary exams for the group of defendants were held throughout 2024 by Ingham County District Court Judge Kristen Simmons, as the group was divided into three groups for three separate multi-day preliminary hearings, the last of which concluded in October 2024. 
Simmons now faces the task to review all the evidence and testimony the court received during the exams and evaluate if the case should proceed to trial. While a May 2 review hearing is set for the defendants, it’s not known when Simmons will hand down her decision.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-876701606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

(File photo by Sviatlana Lazarenka/Getty Images)South Carolina’s state-affiliated hospital system can now proceed with long-delayed expansion plans into some of the Palmetto State’s fastest-growing communities, but it will more than double its debt in the process.
After more than five years of court battles and four years of pandemic-induced financial hardships, the Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system has final approvals in hand to finance two new hospitals in the suburbs of Charleston and Charlotte.
The State Fiscal Accountability Authority gave permission earlier this month for MUSC to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital and cancer center in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
Unanimous approval from the state’s five-member fiscal oversight board came without discussion.
“These projects are good projects in and of themselves,” MUSC Health CEO Dr. Pat Cawley told the SC Daily Gazette. “We know both are in growing areas and we know those areas can easily support these facilities.”
The new borrowing adds to the public hospital system’s $836 million in existing long-term debt and leases, according to an April financial report.
By comparison, the similarly sized Prisma Health hospital system, headquartered in Greenville, carries a debt load of about $1.5 billion, according to the latest report from Wall Street ratings agencies.
Unlike the private Prisma Health, MUSC Health is a state-owned nonprofit.
But Cawley is not concerned by the financial lift, saying MUSC Health has more than enough borrowing capacity.
Expansive growth
MUSC Health first announced plans for the Summerville hospital in December 2017, citing the community’s booming population with mega developments such as the Nexton community filling up with thousands of new homes.
Hospital executives said patients were already making the drive from once-rural Berkeley County into downtown Charleston for health care. It was around this time the hospital system started talking about a new strategy to bring services closer to where patients live.
Two years later, MUSC purchased community hospitals in Chester and Lancaster counties and saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
Indian Land had the second-fastest-growing ZIP code in the state in early 2020, when that project was announced.
“That whole area where the population is booming is a bedroom community of Charlotte,” Cawley said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “We already have patients and employees who commute to our existing hospital in Lancaster to receive care or to work.”
“It’s been shown that to serve patients most effectively, you need to be where they are,” Cawley added. “Patients want to receive their health care closest to home and family. These days, we can build a small hospital and do it in a cost-efficient way so patients don’t have to travel.”
The announcement followed the system’s 2019 purchase of four rural community hospitals — in Florence and Marion, in addition to Lancaster and Chester.
That upended the health system’s nearly 200-year history of staying largely contained to its Charleston base.
In 2021, MUSC Health again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands.
The public system took on debt for all of those purchases. Plus, it still owes upwards of $430 million for its 5-year-old children’s hospital and its Ashley River Tower hospital, which opened in 2008.
With all that, MUSC Health is still at less than half of its debt capacity, Cawley said.
While its tab is set to more than double, revenues generated by the two new hospitals when they open also will grow the system’s borrowing power, though Cawley did not say by how much.
Moody’s ratings agency praised MUSC for its “prudent fiscal management” when it held the combined university and hospital system steady at its highest-level credit rating. Analysts with the firm did note some concerns however, with the hospital’s significant debt leveraging and narrow margins.
Still, a lot has changed since MUSC Health’s December 2017 announcement about the Summerville location.
For starters, the hospital system suffered four years of operating losses that started with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic.
“COVID created a major workforce disruption. That was a big issue for hospitals all across the country,” said Thornton Kirby, president of the South Carolina Hospital Association. “It also caused a significant financial crisis, because the labor costs went up so much when the reimbursement rates (paid to hospitals by insurance, Medicare and Medicaid) were not going up at the same rate.”
MUSC Health’s operations were back in the black as of last June, with the system’s 16 hospitals earning nearly $62 million in income after expenses for fiscal year 2023-24.
“We held back simply due to COVID-induced uncertainty,” Cawley said of the new hospital plans. “Since then, the need has grown, and we are ready to move forward again.”
Regulatory changes
In addition to the pandemic, the projects were also held up by legal challenges filed under the state’s soon-to-be phased out regulatory process that required providers to get a Certificate of Need.
The bureaucratic permission process was supposed to control costs and prevent duplication by providers in the same area. But critics argued the protections ended up reducing access to care and increasing costs as hospital systems fought in court to prevent competition and tied up proposals for years — as occurred with MUSC’s plans for Nexton and Indian Land.
Under a 2023 law phasing out the application approval process, new hospitals will no longer need a Certificate of Need starting in 2027.
While that will end lawsuits and hefty legal fees for hospital operators, it also opens them up to more competition for patients, particularly from hospital systems in border states.
“The truth of it is, hospitals make a lot of money in some areas and lose a lot of money in some areas,” Kirby said. “They make money on surgery and on imaging, and they lose money in the emergency room. They lose money taking care of pneumonia patients and they lose money delivering babies.”
That means hospitals rely on those money-making procedures to subsidize the other care provided.
“If you say anybody can build anything they want, they’re not going to build behavioral health units that lose money. They’re not going to build trauma services,” Kirby said. “They’re going to build surgery centers for insured people.”
Despite this, Kirby said hospital systems have not expressed a lot of angst about Certificate of Need going away.
“I hear people saying, ‘OK, this is the new environment. Let me decide what I’m going to do as a result,'” he said.
Unlike the SC Hospital Association, MUSC Health actually backed the law’s repeal, Cawley said.
He’s confident the hospital system will “remain successful and competitive in South Carolina.”
And there’s no end in site for the hospital system’s spending spree.
MUSC Health recently announced plans for a new cancer hospital in downtown Charleston.
“This is a monumental event for the entire state,” Charles Schulze, chairman of MUSC’s governing board, said in a statement. “The goal here is to have something that rivals the top cancer facilities in the nation so no one has to leave South Carolina for cancer care.”
That’s on top of the purchase of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula announced last August.
MUSC Health has not named a dollar amount for either of these projects.
The price for the Roper building will be decided in 2029, when the hospital is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

The legislation passed after years of efforts by Black Democrats in the Alabama Legislature, who either saw their proposals rejected or were effectively forced by Republicans to pair Juneteenth with Jefferson Davis’ Birthday, a state holiday honoring the slaveholder and white supremacist who said that Black Americans were “fitted expressly for human servitude.” 
The House last year approved a bill sponsored by Rep. Juanadalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, that would have required state employees to choose Juneteenth or Jefferson Davis’ Birthday as their day off, a choice not required of any other state holiday. 
Several Black Democrats said during the debate on the bill last year that they struggled with whether to support the legislation with the Davis requirement. The House approved the bill, but it did not come out of the Senate.  
Several Black Democrats in the House Thursday expressed their frustration that Rehm’s bill — which makes Juneteenth a standalone holiday not tied to Davis’ birthday — won approval from the majority Republican Legislature while Givan’s had to be altered before it could come to a vote. 
“There’s something wrong that the only way it could be a good bill is that somebody else carries it, and not the people that was affected by it in the first place,” Moore said.
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Mobile, echoed Moore and said he was thankful the bill would pass but was upset that it took a white Republican like Rehm to pass it.
“Sometimes we need to win for our community,” Bracy said. “We’ve had people that have brought this legislation for decades, and it wasn’t good enough.”
The bill passed 85-4 with a floor amendment by Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, that moved the effective date up to June 1 so that state employees could reap the benefits of the legislation this year. 
“It was going to be taking effect on October 1, and we wanted it to take effect prior to the actual holiday,” Rehm said, supporting the amendment.
Gov. Kay Ivey has signed memos for the last four years making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth has also been a federally recognized holiday since 2021.
Alabama’s official state holiday calendar puts Robert E. Lee’s Birthday on the same day as Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The state also marks Confederate Memorial Day on the fourth Monday in April. 
The bill goes to the Senate.

Story continues below.
2025.4.16 – Complaint
 
There is no evidence of widespread noncitizen voter fraud. It is illegal under both state and federal law to cast a ballot as a noncitizen.
“Following the Biden administration’s obstruction here, I expect that President (Donald) Trump’s team will resolve this matter,” Rokita said in the release. “This lawsuit is another important step in ensuring the integrity of our elections. Hoosiers have a right to know that legitimate ballots are not being diluted by noncitizens. I promised that I would get citizenship information from USCIS, and that is exactly what I am doing by filing this suit.”  
Though Trump took office in January, his administration has also declined to respond to Indiana’s request. Over a dozen other states have filed similar missives. 
The 585,774 Hoosiers from the Oct. 11 letter include those who registered without an Indiana driver’s license number or a social security number — or who live overseas. Some of those could include Hoosiers who registered before those numbers were required. 
It represents roughly 12% of the registered voters for the November election. 
But critics pushed back, saying that the USCIS Person Centric Query Service wasn’t designed to process large numbers of voters and could be prone to error. 
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn said Hoosiers deserve better. 
Indiana officials ask federal government to verify citizenship of 585K registered voters

“It is shameful that the Attorney General and Secretary of State continue to put partisan games at the forefront of their job responsibilities. Indiana elections are, and always have been, safe and secure. This is just another attempt to spread misinformation about voting and at the same time, intimidate naturalized citizens from exercising their rights. Hoosiers deserve better than this waste of taxpayer dollars wrapped up in an unnecessary lawsuit,” Vaughn said.
The Department of Homeland Security does offer access to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, which requires an identifier such as a registration number, which makes it “not suited” for verification, according to the lawsuit. 
In October, Morales told the Capital Chronicle that the verification push stemmed from county-level officials concerned about an uptick in absentee ballot requests for overseas voters — Hoosiers living abroad, including those in the military, vote using absentee ballots.
“As Indiana’s Chief Election Officer, ensuring the integrity of our elections is non-negotiable,” Morales said in the Monday release. “This legal action is a continuation of our efforts for Indiana to lead the way in election integrity. Since we never received a response from the Biden administration, we know that under President Trump’s leadership and based on his recent Executive Order, there’s a stronger commitment to the election process. Hoosiers deserve nothing less than full confidence in the security of their vote.”
It’s unclear what executive order Morales referenced, though a breakdown of election-oriented proclamations by the Brennan Center for Justice includes an overhaul that the left-leaning group said was illegal. 
In particular, Trump’s actions align with the Congressional SAVE Act, which some have worried would disenfranchise married women who changed their last names but might not have matching documentation. Under SAVE, individuals must present a passport, birth certificate or other citizenship documentation when registering.

More than two-thirds know someone impacted by SUD, and the data shows robust support – across political and demographic lines – for a health-first approach to the issue. North Carolinians support expanding access to the full spectrum of evidence-based SUD treatment, including medications and eliminating SUD-based discrimination.
Leaders in North Carolina’s executive and legislative branches can take heart in this emerging consensus of support for their efforts to combat the state’s overdose epidemic. Fortunately, Governor Josh Stein and First Lady Anna Stein both support access to evidence-based treatment and ending the stigma that interferes with the delivery of treatment. 
Additionally, State Representative Timothy Reeder and State Senator Jim Burgin recently held a press conference with the Addiction Professionals of NC (APNC) to announce the NC Treatment Connection website, aimed at ensuring all SUD treatment providers in the state use evidence-based models.
These efforts are essential since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ranks North Carolina in the top 15 states with the highest fatal overdose rates. According to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, 2023 (the most current year of data) marks NC’s highest rate of fatal overdose since 2010, with an estimated 4,442 deaths. That’s 12 deaths per day, more than double the rate of fatalities from vehicle crashes  that year.
For opioid use disorder, the most evidence-based form of treatment uses either methadone or buprenorphine, two of the three medications approved by the FDA for treatment of this disorder. The third, naltrexone, has much less robust evidence of efficacy.
Buprenorphine and methadone are effective at treating opioid withdrawal and cravings for opioids. These two medications for opioid disorder (MOUD), in repeated studies, show a reduction in overdose death rates of at least two-fold. 
If a medication showed such a reduction in death when used to treat any other chronic condition, failing to provide that medication would be malpractice. Yet MOUD is often prohibited in settings such as drug courts, skilled nursing facilities, and even in residential SUD treatment programs. These stigmatizing practices lead to unnecessary deaths.
We must eliminate MOUD- and SUD- based discrimination in all settings, especially healthcare settings. The stigma some medical professionals hold towards people with SUD can lead to dangerous results. Studies have shown clinicians can miss important diagnoses or deny care when they harbor preconceived ideas about patients. 
Inadequate treatment of withdrawal symptoms causes patients to leave against medical advice or avoid medical care completely. Verbal and nonverbal communication of disdain or judgment from medical providers intensifies the shame already felt by patients with SUD and harms the therapeutic relationship. Even at facilities treating SUD, some providers carry negative attitudes towards life-saving buprenorphine and methadone.
The people of North Carolina also have reasons for optimism. In 2024, North Carolina experienced a five-year low of 12,447 emergency department visits due to overdose. The availability of naloxone, now free at many jails, health departments, and harm reduction sites, and the use of mobile OUD treatment clinics to reach people in areas that previously lacked access has contributed to this positive trend.
Clearly, there’s much more work to be done. North Carolina’s widespread support for strategies that prioritize treatment over punishment signals a prime opportunity for action. NC leaders should build on their efforts in three key ways:

Ensure emergency departments, primary care providers, jails, recovery courts, and SUD treatment programs all provide – or act as conduits to – evidence-based treatment.
Expand the SUD treatment workforce
Ensure public funds, including opioid settlement money, only support programs that provide access to evidence-based treatment.

Overwhelming public support for a health-first approach, the leadership of policymakers committed to change, and the availability of lifesaving interventions bring the overdose crisis within our reach for positive change.
By investing in treatment, harm reduction, and policies that promote recovery and combat discrimination, North Carolina can save lives and create a robust healthcare system that treats all people with dignity and respect. There is consensus, and the path forward is clear.

(FatCamera/Getty Images)On the week that North Carolina senators were busy rolling out a $32.6B spending plan, it was difficult to gain attention for legislation that some consider a longshot this session. But Senator Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham, Durham) refused to allow budget week to shift her focus from what she sees as the critical need to pass a bill crafted to improve Black maternal health outcomes.
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. And Black women in the U.S. are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related health problems than white women.
  Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Murdock has repeated those sobering facts for more than three years now, as she tries to get the Republican-controlled Senate to advance the MOMnibus 3.0 Act.
Battling perceptions and negative stereotypes
Gabriel Scott, an MPA with the North Carolina Coalition of the National Council of Negro Women, joined Murdock last week in advocating for Senate Bill 571/House Bill 725.
Scott said when she went into labor at 25 weeks, doctors were dismissive.
“I needed pain medication, I needed help, I needed something. They did not listen.”
After she delivered her twins, complications with the placenta and an excessive loss of blood, left her husband terrified she might need a blood transfusion.
“They finally had an anesthesiologist come to give me medication. My husband said, can you at least tell me what the medication is? And the anesthesiologist laughed and said, ‘Oh, this is typically medicine we give to war vets who have had limbs blown off,’” Scott recounted. “They took it as a joke. The doctor continued to shove his arm in me.”
Hours later in recovery, a white female doctor came to her room acknowledging the difficulty of the delivery.
“And she said, there are things that we know we do well at the hospital and then there are things that we know we don’t do well, and one of those things is our treatment of African-American women and childbirth.”
The same doctor suggested both she and her husband might seek mental health help.
Scott gives thanks to God that her twin girls are healthy. But she’s been dealing with pelvic pain for over four years and the trauma of doctors who didn’t listen to her.
  Dr. Charity Watkins (Photo: Duke.edu)
Dr. Charity Watkins, an assistant professor of social work at North Carolina Central University and a maternal health researcher at Duke University, shared her own terrifying story of pregnancy-related heart failure.
“I always feel it is important for me to introduce myself using my professional roles. Maybe my doctoral degree will save me from the daily mistreatment I experienced because of my dark complexion. Maybe leaning into the perceived prestige of being a professor will protect me from poor perceptions and negative stereotypes associated with being a Black woman,” Watkins told a room of reporters on Wednesday.
After her pregnancy, Watkins presented with classic heart failure symptoms, a family history of heart disease, and a recent cesarean delivery followed by hemorrhaging.
She was told by a doctor that maybe it was the flu.
“What could have led to me receiving quality health care without having to prove I’m worthy of being treated as a human being?”
MOMnibus 3.0
Watkins believes the MOMnibus 3.0 Act would have changed her birth story, with doctors who would not have dismissed her as being over-dramatic or “just another Black woman exaggerating her pain levels.”
The legislation would direct the NC Department of Health and Human Services to establish and operate a maternal mortality prevention grant initiative that would establish or expand programs for the prevention of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among Black women.
  Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“It’s time for us to provide Black mothers with more confidence in their care before, during, and after childbirth,” said Watkins.
The legislation would also require NCDHHS, in collaboration with community-based organizations led by Black women and a historically Black college and universities (HBCUs) that primarily serves minority populations to create evidence-based implicit bias training program for health care professionals.
Patients receiving care at a perinatal care facility would also receive a list of their rights including being informed of continuing health care requirements following discharge.
The bill would also earmark $3 million for each year of the 2025-27 biennium for the UNC Board of Governors for recruiting, training, and retaining a diverse workforce of lactation consultants in North Carolina.
Reps. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) and Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) are advocating for HB 725, the companion bill in the state House.
Hawkins said his two sisters and his wife had their own stories in which doctors were not “listening appropriately” to their pain, and the fact that they knew their own bodies.
Von Haefen said while it may not seem like her place to speak on Black health, she also knew she could not turn away.
“This should not be something that’s put solely on Black women. White women need to be allies in this fight, because we are all mothers.”
In North Carolina Black women are 1.8 times more likely to die from childbirth, two-thirds of these deaths are preventable, according to Murdock.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/black-maternal-health2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

The protests coincided with the 250th anniversary of the first battles of the Revolutionary War and were part of the “50501” protest movement, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states and one movement.
Joy Jochim of Mandan displayed a sign calling for the protection of transgender rights. She said she is against many of the initiatives President Donald Trump’s administration is carrying out in its first months of work, such as cuts to the Social Security Administration and proposed cuts to Medicaid.
“I’m glad people are coming out and protesting,” Jochim said. 
Sharon Korsmo of Bismarck said a person’s “day in court” is fundamental and expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s deportations of hundreds of people to an El Salvador prison without the chance to challenge their cases in court. 
“How do we know who he’s going to turn on next?” Korsmo said.
Kori Holub, an occupational therapist in Dickinson, said she’s already noticing the children with disabilities she treats on the Medicaid program are unable to get “medical necessity” services at their homes based on her recommendations.
She said those kids won’t have access at home to equipment such as a disability swing or support vests.
Holub also volunteers with the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, which helps veterans with traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and other injuries participate in adaptive sports. 
During the clinic over the winter, Holub said some Department of Veterans Affairs employees received notices for layoffs, which worried her because those federal workers are a large part of the program.
“I don’t expect this (the winter sports clinic) to happen this year,” she said. “We’ll see.”

During a press conference Monday, Driskell highlighted Florida Highway Patrol’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday, when he was a passenger in a car during a traffic stop on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The 20-year-old, born in Georgia, was charged under a temporarily suspended law making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
  House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell (via Florida House of Representatives)
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday. Lopez-Gomez was released from jail Thursday evening, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is in custody of the driver of the car, who doesn’t enjoy legal permanent status, in a Broward County transitional center.
“We are a nation of laws, and no one — not Ron DeSantis, not Donald Trump — no one gets to decide to imprison people without cause,” Driskell said. “We need better answers about this. Ron DeSantis and his administration need to answer for this unlawful arrest, and for the pain and suffering they caused, and the fear that they continue to stoke throughout our communities.”
Attorney general tells law enforcement to stand down
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues that the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
“I should also note that while my office represents the current defendants named in this case, it does not represent nonparties like your law enforcement agencies,” Uthmeier wrote in the memo.
The new attorney general, who used to be Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff, said the state would continue this argument in the federal court for the Southern District of Florida or an appellate court.
His memo came at the direction of U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams on Friday, when she extended the bar on enforcement until the next hearing on April 29.
The judge had barred enforcement of the law on April 4, a little over a month after DeSantis signed it, and she expressed frustration during the Friday hearing in Miami about Lopez-Gomez’s arrest.
Immigrant advocacy groups, Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status are suing Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys over the constitutionality of the law.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix Friday. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-budget-fiscal-guardrails-pushback/,"State legislators will propose their budget Tuesday, using every loophole and maneuver available to bend budget caps without breaking them.","Though potentially massive cuts in federal aid loom, Connecticut’s General Assembly can’t tackle that crisis until it first solves another.
State budget caps that amassed huge surpluses since 2017 have taken a heavy toll, leaving big challenges for funding education, health care and social services. 
The legislature’s Appropriations Committee will begin trying to plug those gaps Tuesday when it proposes a spending plan for the next two fiscal years. That blueprint will set the stage for final budget negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont later this spring or summer as the picture from Washington becomes clearer.
In the meantime, state legislators will use every loophole and maneuver available to bend these budget caps — or “fiscal guardrails” — without breaking them.

The committee will assume raises for most state employees, due this July 1, won’t be negotiated on time.


Legislators will propose reforming one “guardrail” immediately — moving about $300 million earmarked to reduce pension debt back into the General Fund this fiscal year.


As Lamont did, the panel will endorse creating a big, new off-budget account to expand child care services while circumventing a spending cap that keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation.


It also will follow Lamont’s lead and under-fund guaranteed health benefits for retired state employees by almost $230 million.

Even with these maneuvers, the committee’s spending plan will postpone — yet again — a major increase in Medicaid rates for physicians who treat the poor. The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
But the committee plan will maintain enhanced funding for special education while reversing planned cuts to basic grants for about 80 K-12 school districts.
“We need to stop looking at the storm down in Washington and look at the storm that’s here in Connecticut,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. 
“There are a lot of things that need to be addressed,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the panel’s other co-chair, who added the panel tried to stabilize those programs most at risk before expected federal cuts blast big new holes in numerous state programs.
“I’m not a hair-on-fire kind of person. I’m not exaggerating anything,” she added. “But the things that are being cut at the federal level are going to have a big impact on the people.”
With Congress aiming to slash federal spending by $880 billion per year, state officials project losses in Medicaid funds alone could range from almost $200 million to about $1 billion. And that doesn’t include anticipated losses in special education, public health and addiction services, and federal aid to Connecticut municipalities.
But state programs already have been forfeiting big dollars for nearly a decade.
‘Fiscal guardrails’ have taken a toll
Connecticut has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average of $1.8 billion left over — a whopping total equal to roughly 8% of the General Fund and far more than legislators from both parties envisioned in 2017 when they enacted a broad array of budget caps.
Lamont’s administration projects Connecticut will close the current fiscal year — its eighth under the so-called “fiscal guardrails” system — with a similar, $1.8 billion cushion.
Those windfalls don’t mean state government can spare all those funds.
Critics say the “guardrails” system falsely characterizes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual income and business tax receipts as too “volatile” — meaning they fluctuate too much from year to year and shouldn’t be spent on ongoing problems. Instead, these revenues, which have been used to build reserves and whittle down pension debt, have grown steadily.
The leaching of resources from education, health care and social services has been mitigated somewhat by the nearly $3 billion Congress gave Connecticut in 2021 to repair damage caused by COVID. Lamont and the General Assembly have been doling out chunks of these pandemic grants, including more than $500 million this fiscal year, to these core programs. 
But nearly all that relief has been exhausted. 
While Democrats in the legislature’s majority have been vocal critics of the caps, they aren’t the only ones who’ve struggled to follow them.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat who praised the caps repeatedly, conceded in February that the program for saving “volatile” revenues should be scaled back. He proposed moving about $300 million annually, starting next year, from the save category into safe-to-spend.
While Republicans insist the “guardrails” be left untouched, their votes haven’t matched their statements.
The GOP voted overwhelmingly with Democrats in late February to order an extra $40 million in aid to local K-12 districts to mitigate a crisis in special education — despite warnings from Lamont that expenditures already were on pace to exceed the spending cap.
Panel finds more for K-12 education, social services, child care
The Appropriations Committee wants to continue that extra $40 million in special education grants in each of the next two fiscal years. Lamont’s budget included the extra funding, but not until 2026-27. 
That’s because the governor’s biennial plan, which appropriates $27 billion across all programs in the first year, falls a razor-thin $1.8 million under the spending cap. The $28.2 billion proposed for 2026-27 falls a more comfortable $261 million under the limit.
The committee’s plan will recommend more spending than Lamont did in some other areas:

Education Cost Sharing [ECS] grants, the main state funding program for K-12 district expenses, would gain another $8.7 million in the first year and $17 million in the second so that no community would receive a cut in funding. The existing ECS formula calls for about 80 communities to receive less in the next budget cycle.


The private, nonprofit community agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services for people with developmental disabilities would gain $19 million to replace expiring pandemic grant dollars Lamont and lawmakers gave them last spring.

The committee would follow Lamont’s lead and create a new $300 million account, outside of the formal budget and spending cap, to allow investments in child care services for years to come.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee said only that the administration “will review the General Assembly’s budget proposal when it is officially released and then work with legislative leaders on an honestly balanced budget that complies with all legal requirements.”
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican, predicted GOP lawmakers would fight the committee proposal, which she said places too much emphasis on working around budget caps and not enough on finding ways to trim state spending.
“They’re putting in a budget that’s expanding the size of government” at the wrong time, she said.
Struggling to find dollars for Medicaid rates, retiree health care
The committee plan will not fix two other problems legislators are facing — at least not right away.
The first involves financing a major upgrade in Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states, just ahead of West Virginia.
Earlier this year, Democratic legislators announced a plan to boost spending on Medicaid rates by $300 million by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Instead, the Appropriations Committee spending plan hew closely to the increased spending Lamont proposed in February: adding about $10 million next fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27 for a much more modest, incremental bump.
The second major problem involves funding for retiree health care.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that the committee find another $228 million over the next budget cycle — in addition to what Lamont proposed — to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan.
Scanlon said he is very hopeful those cost hikes can be reduced somewhat in the coming months. The comptroller is soliciting bids for a new Medicare Advantage provider, directing patients to lower-cost care sites and providers and negotiating savings on prescription drugs.
Like Lamont did, the committee also will wait to see how much savings the comptroller can secure before scrambling to find more dollars for this retirement benefit.
Thousands of state employees may be waiting a while for a raise
The committee plan also has no room under the spending cap to pay raises to most state workers next fiscal year, even though their contracts expire June 30.
Connecticut did reach a tentative deal recently with a small unit representing part-time teachers at online Charter Oak State College. And a raise agreement is expected soon with the state police troopers.
But Lamont has announced no wage agreement with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which represents every major union excluding the troopers.
SEBAC unions have received about 4.5% annual raises — a 2.5% general hike and a step increase that normally is worth another 2 percentage points — for the past four fiscal years. According to nonpartisan analysts, this year’s raises cost the General Fund about $120 million.
Anticipating similar raises going forward, Lamont in February proposed adding $129 million to the reserve for salary adjustments in the 2025-26 fiscal year, and $242 million extra in 2026-27.
But if the governor and SEBAC don’t deliver a tentative deal to lawmakers before the regular session ends June 4, then the prospects of raises being approved on time are slim. 
That doesn’t mean workers would forfeit raises. A pay hike eventually ordered for 2025-26 might be delivered late — as has been done on occasion in the past.
In other words, legislators could budget nothing for raises in 2025-26, carving out $129 million in spending cap room in the fiscal year they need it most, and deliver retroactive raises in 2026-27, when the cap doesn’t fit so snugly. It just requires Lamont and the unions to take their time reaching a deal.
“Everybody has indicated to me it will not happen this year,” Osten said. 
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to comment on the timing of contract negotiations, as did Drew Stoner, spokesman for the coalition of unions.
Stoner added, though, that “what remains clear is the vital role our public services — and the 45,000 state workers who keep Connecticut running. With agencies across the state understaffed and federal uncertainty growing, we must do everything we can to recruit and retain the workforce needed to meet this moment. The public deserves nothing less.”
Speeding up reform of budget ‘guardrails’
Recognizing their plan has some holes, Appropriations Committee members also will try to carve out some extra dollars that could be tapped later.
While Lamont proposed scaling back one mandatory savings program by $300 million starting next fiscal year, the committee will propose that change happen right away. That would allow legislators, if necessary, to take $300 million of this fiscal year’s surplus, transfer those dollars to either of the next two fiscal years, and spend them on core programs at that time.
“I think the most important thing Connecticut can do is adopt a budget on time, fund the core things we wanted to fund, … and give people predictability,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who said top legislative leaders also are backing the committee’s proposal to begin “guardrails” reform right away.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC05379.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

Experts worry that Medicaid’s complexity can make it hard for people to see how potential cuts to the program’s funding could impact not just insurance coverage, but also could result in longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.
From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

California is making progress in curbing fentanyl-related deaths, but opioid overdoses continue to kill thousands of people every year.


Any Californian can purchase naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medication, directly from the state at a discounted price, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announced Monday. 
The medication is available online for $24 for a two-pack of the nasal spray, roughly half the market price of the drug. Previously, the discount was available only to government organizations and businesses. 
“Life-saving medications shouldn’t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all — not the privileged few,” Newsom said in a statement. CalRx is a Newsom initiative to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 
California has spent more than $1 billion fighting the opioid epidemic, which killed more than 8,900 people last year, according to preliminary data from the state health department. That represents a 13% increase in deaths from 2023. 
The Naloxone Distribution Project and Access Initiative is part of the strategy to stop overdoses, which began spiking in 2019 as fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, infused the market. The rate of fentanyl-related overdose deaths began declining last year, according to state data.
More than 6 million naloxone kits have been distributed to local governments and organizations since 2018, according to state data. About 355,000 overdoses have been reversed.
In 2024, Newsom’s office announced a new supplier for the state initiative, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, which agreed to sell the steeply discounted drug to California. Days prior, Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a $273-million multistate settlement with the New Jersey-based company over its alleged failure to report suspicious opioid orders that contributed to the country’s epidemic.
“By getting this lower price, we are making the financial savings and able to use our dollars to buy more product, which of course is ultimately very much about saving lives,” said Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the Department of Health Care Access and Information, last year. 
Naloxone is one of two current efforts by the state to make generic drugs more affordable under Newsom’s effort to lower the costs of pharmaceuticals. California has a $50-million contract to manufacture generic insulins for CalRx. That project is more than a year behind schedule.

The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of “the shot heard ’round the world” on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago.
Thomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston. The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believes Americans are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it.
“This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” said Bassford, who was with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. “I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”
In Denver, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Colorado State Capitol with banners expressing solidarity with immigrants and telling the Trump administration: “Hands Off!” People waved U.S. flags, some of them held upside down to signal distress.
Thousands of people also marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, while in San Francisco, hundreds spelled out the words “Impeach & Remove” on a sandy beach along the Pacific Ocean, also with an inverted U.S. flag. People walked through downtown Anchorage, Alaska, with handmade signs listing reasons why they were demonstrating, including one that one that read: “No sign is BIG enough to list ALL of the reasons I’m here!”
Elsewhere protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community service-oriented events such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.
The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide demonstrations.
Organizers say they oppose what they call Trump’s civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shuttering entire agencies.
Some of the events drew on the spirit of the Revolutionary War, calling for “no kings” and resistance to tyranny.
In Anchorage, a colonial reenactor in colonial garb held up a “No Kings” sign while the person next to him hoisted cardboard that read in part: “The Feudal Age is OVER.”
Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those at the Concord protest, said he is concerned that the president is creating a “police state.” He held a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!”
“He’s defying the courts. He’s kidnapping students. He’s eviscerating the checks and balances,” Bryant said. “This is fascism.”
In Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.
The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.
“I cannot sit still knowing that if I don’t do anything and everybody doesn’t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,” Fasick said.
In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.”
And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower.
“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted to a steady drumbeat, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Marshall Green said he is most concerned that Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation’s government, even though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between them.
“Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. “You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.”
Meanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach,” citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges.
“We’re supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it’s just unbelievable.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Maine voters send our elected officials to Washington to solve problems — not make them worse. But Congress is moving forward with budget plans that would harm the health, stability, and well-being of Maine’s families, aging residents, and immigrant communities. Fortunately, Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and our representatives have the opportunity to reject these dangerous proposals and fund real solutions.
The proposals being advanced by Congress would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance that Mainers rely on and funnel billions into expanding the Trump administration’s capacity to separate families and put immigrants in detention — severely compromising our communities’ health, safety, and stability.
As the oldest state in the country, Maine communities rely on Medicaid and a strong healthcare system to stay healthy. More than 350,700 Mainers rely on Medicaid, which faces billions in budget cuts under these proposals. These cuts could cause devastating damage to our healthcare economy. Community health centers — serving 204,000 patients at 174 clinics across the state — would likely have to close their doors, costing over 2,200 jobs.
Our families also depend on food assistance, but the current budget proposals threaten to take it away. On top of the USDA cuts that pull food from the shelves of distributors like Good Shepherd Food Bank, Congress’s proposals would sharply cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding, which feeds over 172,200 — or one in eight — Maine residents. 
While these budget plans make devastating cuts to programs that Maine’s young and old depend on, they authorize Congress to allocate billions to separate families and uproot workers who call Maine home.  
Immigrants are integral members of our state’s communities, but Congress’s budget proposals include up to $350 billion — potentially up to a half-trillion — to drastically expand the Trump administration’s ability to detain and deport our immigrant neighbors. The administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency recently put out a request for proposal for new detention centers — potential contracts totaling up to $45 billion. The funding to pay for them would come directly from taxpayers. 
The devastation from this inhumane investment would be felt most acutely by our families and economy. Over 20,500 children in Maine have at least one immigrant parent. As of 2023, nearly 53,450 immigrants live in Maine — and though they make up only 3.8% of the state’s population, immigrant workers account for nearly 5% of the state’s labor force, filling critical gaps as older generations retire. In 2023 alone, Maine’s immigrant residents paid $625.8 million in taxes, contributing to the Medicare, Social Security, and other programs that Mainers depend on.
Instead of taking taxpayers’ dollars away from healthcare and nutrition to fund family separation and tax breaks for the wealthy, Congress must invest in solutions that enhance the health, stability, and family unity of all Mainers. They should invest in less costly, more supportive services like legal representation that uphold the right to due process and help people navigate the immigration system without taking them away from their families, communities, and jobs. And they should maintain and support our nation’s longstanding investment in healthcare and food assistance.
The stakes for our communities couldn’t be higher, and the budget decisions made by Congress this spring will have long-lasting consequences. As Maine’s members of Congress move forward with their debates on budget reconciliation, we urge them to remember this: the health and stability of our communities is in your hands; we send you to Washington to solve problems and deliver solutions that give every Mainer a fair shot at building a safe, healthy, and meaningful life.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas State Department of Education commissioner Randy Watson has an unobstructed view of financial, political and social battles about how best to educate nearly 500,000 school children in Kansas.
In addition to regular collaboration with members of the Kansas State Board of Education, he routinely visits classrooms to absorb perspectives on everything from the basics of reading and math to human sexuality, special education, summer school and the training of current and future teachers. He wades into issues of access to computer technology and cellphones in schools. He’s there for debates on appropriation of state and federal tax dollars to public education, as well as how that funding was deployed in more than 280 local school districts across Kansas.
“What makes me want to get up in the morning is trying to help young people and the people that serve those young people do their job well. There’s rarely a week that I’m not in schools,” Watson said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I not a politician, but I deal in a political environment all the time. At the end of the day, again, what gets me up is: How can we help people that educate kids have a great environment to do so?”


The state Board of Education has a constitutional responsibility for public education in Kansas and the duty to hire a state education commissioner to assist with crafting policy, rules and regulations aimed at fulfilling the promise of education in preschool to high school classrooms.
Watson, a former teacher and superintendent, recently recommended the state Board of Education and local school boards consider working together on a special summer school program to help the students in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 gain some academic ground in the subjects of reading and math. The COVID-19 pandemic set children back at all levels, he said, but recovery has been influenced by separate decisions to reduce the number of school days while maintaining the required total of annual hours of instruction.
“A lot of research says if you’re not at that grade level by the time you hit third grade, it’s really hard to catch up, and most do not,” he said. “In fact, more fall further behind.”
He said a summer program would be voluntary for students and could involve 90 minutes of instruction daily. Students could come together for four-day weeks and gain about 50 hours of instruction time, he said.
“If that was with one of our many great teachers in Kansas, what could we do? We could stop the summer slide for sure,” he said.
 
Public and private
Of course, the Kansas Legislature and the state’s governor have large roles in terms of funding and policy of public education. That involves politics and, at times, controversy.
Members of the 2025 Legislature attempted, but failed, to gain traction with a bill providing as much as $125 million in annual state funding in the form of state income tax breaks to families of students in private schools. Similar proposals to ease the financial burden of enrolling 26,000 students to accredited and unaccredited private schools have surfaced in Kansas, but those also met the fate of Senate Bill 75. The bill introduced by Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, a former middle school principal in Wichita, didn’t advance in the House or Senate.
“Some states have gone full force into that,” Watson said. “Other states have pulled back. Some states have put that up to a vote. I can tell you currently where the state board is on that. They believe that public funds should go to public education.”
Watson, too, observed as the Legislature placed in state law, despite Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto, contents of a bill that dealt on two objectives. Part of the bill granted the state Board of Education authority to set compensation of elected board members, while the balance mandated public schools that teach anything about human development to also present students with a computer-generated animation or high-definition ultrasound video of fetal development. The law says the presentation must last at least 3 minutes.
A battle between Kansans for Life and Planned Parenthood illustrated the core of the bill was about influencing opinions of school children on abortion rights, which were affirmed by the Kansas Supreme Court and by Kansas voters. Statehouse debate on the fetal development curriculum bill touched on the state Board of Education’s constitutional role in establishing educational standards and the responsibility of local school boards to determine precise curriculum.
“The state board was opposed to that bill. It had nothing to do with the content,” Watson said. “What is shown in a video is a local board decision, and the state board said, while we may or may not like the contents, that is a local decision, and we don’t think the Kansas Legislature should weigh in on it.”
In terms of compensation, the Legislature maneuvered to nearly double their own salaries on Jan. 1. The decision was made to decouple the state Board of Education from the Legislature in terms of daily compensation for travel costs and expenses tied to work for the state. Toward the end of the 2025 session, a bill surfaced with the human development curriculum mandate and a provision directing the state Board of Education to set its own compensation rate. It didn’t include funding to the state Board of Education to address any costs. The state Board of Education plans to take up the issue during a meeting in May.
“They’ll certainly have to do something with it, because the new law says you shall set your rate. So even if they set it where it is now, they’re going to have to take some action to do that,” Watson said.
 
Governor, president
In January, the governor proposed the Legislature pay the cost of meals for children enrolled in the state’s reduced-price school meal program. She suggested lawmakers allocate $5.5 million to provide free rather than subsidized meals to about 36,000 students statewide. With federal assistance, Kansas currently provides free meals to about 40% of students in public schools or approximately 200,000 youths.
Kelly’s idea was for the state to cover the reduced-meal cost for each child at 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch.
“We can reduce childhood hunger, we can reduce the stigma our low-income students face in our school cafeterias, and we can increase academic success,” Kelly said.
Watson said the Republican-led Legislature didn’t buy into the governor’s idea for supplementing the cost of school meals for children in lower-income families.
“What Governor Kelly was proposing is putting some state money into that, but that was not adopted in this legislative session,” he said.
Watson also reflected on lessons learned through former President George W. Bush’s ambitious No Child Left Behind program from 2002 to 2015. It was designed to hold schools accountable for learning among all students, including subgroups of low-income students, students with disabilities and students of color. The objective was to have every student reach proficient levels in math and reading.
NCLB became controversial because it penalized schools that didn’t show annual improvement on standardized student tests. State assessments should be viewed as a measure of how students were doing academically instead of the lone metric of success or failure, Watson said.
“President Bush was thinking, we want kids to learn how to read and do math. It’s a great goal. It’s a noble goal. And I would applaud that,” Watson said. “When we put that into law, I don’t think he could have foreseen what the consequences were going to be if you were going to require that.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations – the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development – have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to earlier this month, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime this week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives.
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says the vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so.
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…”
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued.
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass.
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so.
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said.
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter.
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak… They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.”
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to.
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism.
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued.
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place.
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before this Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction.
Under the agreement, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of last week, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.
Maine’s Department of Education has asked districts to refrain from signing on to the guidance while the state issues a response, according to Ed Week.
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity director


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

This week: what a drop in international tourism means for Minnesota; the most conservative and liberal workplaces; how trucks and SUVs drive road congestion; and meaningful jobs. 
International tourism takes a hit
The Washington Post reported last week that international tourism to the U.S. is plummeting at the start of the second Trump administration. In March, “overseas visitors fell nearly 12% compared with the same time last year, according to data from the International Trade Administration, an agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce,” the paper reports.
The reasons aren’t terribly complicated: Trump seems determined to turn the U.S. into a pariah state, with every day bringing new horror stories of travelers being detained, deported and refused admittance.
In 2023, more than 500,000 international tourists visited Minnesota, according to Explore Minnesota, spending a little over $500 million in the state. The agency had been forecasting 2025 would bring 700,000 international visitors and $700 million in spending, but that’s now unlikely.
More than half of Minnesota’s international tourists hail from Canada. The administration’s ongoing belligerence toward our northern neighbor has fueled a fierce backlash. Minnesota businesses relying on those visitors are likely to be especially hard hit. 
“I don’t want to pay into their economy, I’m going to stay in Winnipeg and go to local events here, put my money here,” one Winnipeg resident told a city newspaper. “And who knows what’ll happen? What if you get your car keyed? We don’t know how they’re going to treat Canadians going down,” she added.
Measuring workforce politics
Last month a team of researchers released a new dataset on the political affiliations of workers at hundreds of thousands of American employers. They did this by linking public voter registration data to online worker profiles maintained by many employers.
They found that workplaces in their sample tend to lean left, with more than 60% of employees identifying as a Democrat (for simplicity’s sake, independents and those not registered with one of the two major parties were excluded from this calculation). But some industries are much more conservative or liberal than others, and the same goes for individual workplaces.
At Target, for instance, fewer than 30% of identifiable employees are registered Republican. Privately owned agriculture behemoth Cargill, on the other hand, has close to a 60% Republican workforce.
“In the context of growing political polarization, employers are entering the political arena in unprecedented ways,” the authors write. “Given the potentially critical role that workers play in shaping these actions, it is critical to have wide-reaching, representative measures of workers’ personal politics.”
Trucks and SUVS are clogging up the roadways, study finds
MPR News reports on a recent study using Minnesota traffic data to analyze how the exploding popularity of trucks and sport-utility vehicles affects traffic flows on roadways.
Minnesota has some of the best traffic data in the United States, the authors note, with reliable numbers going back to the 1990s. That allows researchers to get a sense of how things have changed.
The study looked at the freeway network around Minneapolis and St. Paul, and found that “the average network throughput decreases from approximately 1850 vehicles per lane per hour in 1995 to about 1600 vehicles per lane per hour in 2019.” 
The authors attribute that to the growing popularity of small trucks and SUVs, which take up more space on the road.
“The number of vehicles it takes to reach a congested level of traffic is fewer, and so you’re more likely to see congestion for the same number of people traveling because people are in SUVs and vans and pickup trucks, but especially SUVs,” co-author David Levinson told MPR.
The study found that while the total number of registered vehicles in Minnesota grew by 36% from 1995 to 2019, the number of SUVs increased by more than 1,000%.
1 in 5 Americans say their job “is not making a meaningful contribution to the world”
A recent YouGov survey found that while most American workers say their job makes a difference, 20% told the pollster that their job is essentially meaningless.
People with so-called email jobs — sending and receiving emails and Slack messages and attending meetings — were actually more likely to characterize their jobs as meaningful, although this is probably a function of education: More educated people are also more likely to say their jobs mean something, and they’re also more likely to do email jobs.
Americans who think their own jobs are meaningless are also much more likely to take a dim view of the value of other people’s jobs.
Incidentally, workers in the U.K. are nearly twice as likely as those in the U.S. to say their jobs are meaningless.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2197666840.jpg,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

Dr. Jessica Lowe, a neurologist and epileptologist at Bayhealth, has been named the 2025 Delaware Woman of Impact by the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its Go Red for Women initiative.
The recognition comes after a spirited nine-week campaign in which Lowe led a series of community-focused events and fundraising efforts aimed at fighting heart disease and stroke among women.
Lowe raised $88,000 in donations and earned additional “impact points” through educational and wellness initiatives, ranking fifth overall in the AHA’s Eastern States Region—an area that spans 11 states.
“It was important for me to participate in Woman of Impact because, as a physician, I see firsthand how cardiovascular disease affects women at every stage of life,” Lowe said. “I want to be part of the change that helps ensure women have the knowledge and tools they need to protect their health. I am honored to have received this recognition and am excited to continue working alongside the American Heart Association and its Go Red for Women initiative to help ensure all women know their risk factors and have the information they need to live longer, healthier lives.”

Her campaign included lectures on stroke and neurological health, a steps challenge, goat yoga, and digital outreach through her Instagram platform, @Doctorbrainbarbie.
“Thanks to the efforts of incredible leaders like Dr. Lowe and all of our nominees, we’re making strides to ensure all women in Delaware are seen, heard and counted when it comes to their health,” said Jim Murphy, executive director of the American Heart Association, Delaware. “Together, we have the power to help ensure more women are represented in research, have the information they need for heart health through every stage of life and receive quality and timely care. The power of our community coming together creates better health outcomes for all of us.”
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, taking the life of 1 in 3 women each year.
The Woman of Impact campaign, which launched on National Wear Red Day (February 7), is part of the AHA’s broader effort to raise awareness and improve health outcomes through its Go Red for Women movement.

This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.","Georgia is among the battleground states that since the 2020 presidential election has enacted new laws that could restrict voting access. (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)Pennsylvania voters have been given a raw deal when it comes to early voting options. As we head into another round of municipal elections, voters across the Commonwealth again face the dilemma of whether or not they should stand in long lines to cast their ballots early. Although the problem is worse in some counties than others, it is unacceptable anywhere.
Pennsylvania’s current no-excuse mail ballot system is a good idea on paper, but the long lines early voters face are due to the fact that many voters are filling out their mail ballots in person before they turn them in, likely because they want to ensure they are filled out correctly and will, therefore, be counted.
Therefore, in a state where nearly half of all counties don’t even have a ballot drop box, a strong, well-funded, and complementary-to-no-excuse-mail-ballots system that encourages early voting done in person is an absolute must.
Currently, our counties are not equipped to handle the volume of voters trying to cast their ballots before Election Day because our no-excuse mail ballot system isn’t designed for accessible in-person voting. We need more. The fact that voters are so eager to vote early is exactly why we need a modernized system that can meet this overwhelming demand.
Without the infrastructure in place for true early voting, not only do Pennsylvania voters have to suffer through long lines, but it also causes unnecessary stress on our election workers who already face enormous challenges. Election workers and voters deserve a process that is as efficient, safe, and accessible as possible—one that ensures every voter has a fair chance to have their voice heard.
The solution is obvious: Pennsylvania needs to establish an official system for in-person early voting. This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.
To make this a reality, our election offices need to be fully funded and staffed to meet the demand. It’s not just a nice-to-have option; it’s a necessity to ensure that Pennsylvania’s election system actually works for voters and election workers – and that democracy includes all of us.
This is not some far-fetched idea, either. Pennsylvania leaders can look to nearby states that have provided a clear blueprint for success. In Michigan, where in-person early voting was implemented in time for last year’s general election, there was a marked increase in voter turnout before Election Day.
  Voting booths set up at Madison, Wisconsin’s Hawthorne Library on Election Day 2022. (Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)
According to a recent data analysis released by my organization, All Voting is Local, more than 58 percent of Michigan voters cast their ballots before Election Day in 2024. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, only 27 percent of voters cast their ballots early.
This difference is not just a statistic. It’s a sign that having a statewide plan works when it comes to early voting. In Michigan, the establishment of early voting polling locations allowed voters to cast their ballots ahead of time and reduced long lines on Election Day itself.
This increase in early voting turnout wasn’t limited to one political party or one region—it was a broad, statewide trend. When early voting options are made accessible, voters from all walks of life take advantage of them, because let’s not mince words: long lines are a form of suppression that can deter voters from casting their ballots.
Pennsylvania voters want more voting options, a fact that was made crystal clear in November as they stood in hours-long lines both before and on Election Day. They want to be able to cast their ballots securely without having to wait in line for hours. Most importantly, they want a system that ensures they have a voice in their own democracy.
Without in-person early voting, the voters most impacted will be parents, students, and all working-class folks who often don’t have time to wait in voting lines. Although the lack of in-person early voting disproportionately affects these voters, it’s an issue that impacts all voters. The problem needs to be addressed before voters find themselves standing in long lines again.
Fortunately, we know what the solution is to the problem. This is where Pennsylvania legislators have an opportunity. The window to make meaningful changes to our election code is now. By implementing in-person early voting, Pennsylvania can not only ensure greater voter turnout but also ensure that all voters—regardless of their background—have a fair shot at participating in our democracy. We’ve seen it work elsewhere, and we know it can work here.
Without this change, Pennsylvania voters will continue to face long lines and frustration at the polls. Our election officials will continue to struggle with an outdated system that isn’t equipped to meet the needs of today’s electorate. Without immediate action, we will fail to meet the moment and risk disenfranchising voters in a state that prides itself on being a critical battleground in national elections.
In Pennsylvania, we have the power to make our election system better, more inclusive, and more accessible. But this change can only happen if our leaders in the state legislature act now to make real early voting options a reality. Let’s ensure that every Pennsylvanian has the opportunity to cast their ballot early without unnecessary hurdles. It’s time for Pennsylvania to put in place a system that works for everyone.

Delaware dog owners now have a faster, easier way to license their pets—and bring them home if they ever get lost.
The Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) has teamed up with pet registration provider DocuPet to roll out a new online dog licensing platform and lost pet recovery service across the state.
The user-friendly system is designed to streamline the licensing process and strengthen efforts to reunite lost pets with their families.
Tracking lost dogs
Under the new program, canine owners who register their pets on the DocuPet platform will receive a uniquely coded ID tag linked to a secure online profile.
If a pet goes missing, owners can quickly create a Lost Pet Report.
Anyone who finds a lost canine can use the tag’s code to file a Found Pet Report in seconds. A 24/7 dispatch team is also on hand to help reconnect pets and owners at any hour.

“Our new partnership with DocuPet will be extremely valuable to dog owners and necessary for animal safety within the state,” said Christina Motoyoshi, director of OAW. “Licensing your dog helps reduce the number of animals in shelters, freeing up space and resources for pets in need. Licensing also helps to ensure public safety and support critical animal services to our community. We’re excited for residents to take advantage of this program to help keep their own pets and others in the community safe.”
Dog licensing is required by law in Delaware for all dogs six months or older and must be accompanied by proof of rabies vaccination.
To encourage pet owners to comply, the state is waiving late fees for expired licenses through July 15, 2025. Existing licenses will remain valid until their expiration.
Pet owners can sign up here, where they can also choose from standard or customizable designer tags.
As a bonus, the promo code “LICENSES” offers $5 off designer tags for a limited time.
The initiative is part of OAW’s ongoing mission to promote animal welfare and public safety across Delaware. T
he program is supported by Delaware Animal Services (DAS), the enforcement arm of OAW that handles dog control, rabies response, and animal cruelty investigations.

Photo courtesy of Ryan Fiereck. If you’re a reader, a student of history, or a writer, it’s been appalling to watch book bans proliferate across the nation. As The Reformer reported last month, St. Francis High School and Independent School District 15 recently adopted a policy that defers to Booklooks, a website linked to the far-right group Moms for Liberty when evaluating which books to purchase or pull from shelves.
The result: Hundreds of books are now either banned outright or will likely be pulled from shelves in the near future; this includes classics like The Handmaid’s Tale, The Bluest Eye, and soon, perhaps the likes of “Night” by Elie Wiesel and “Slaughterhouse Five” by Kurt Vonnegut and hundreds of others.
I graduated from St. Francis High School in 2001. I owe much of my career as a writer — I’ve written ten books and edited many more — to one of the soon-to-banned books. It was “Slaughterhouse Five.” It was the year 2000. Frosted tips and Billabong shirts were everywhere. I picked up the book from a spinner in my journalism class. (That teacher was the best teacher I ever had.) I absorbed it, and I proceeded to read every other book by Vonnegut on the spinner, and then Ray Bradbury; soon I was reading Sylvia Plath and Richard Wright. A good book is a springboard to others; the best books lead to a lifetime of a reading.
Rather than trot out generic arguments about why book bans are ill-advised, I want to talk about “Slaughterhouse Five.” It’s a fictionalized story, that like all truly great fiction, is, at its heart, true. Vonnegut was a G.I. in World War II. He was in the 106th Infantry Division and was captured during the Battle of the Bulge. To put that another way: The St. Francis school board wants to ban a novel written by an American serviceman and a member of the Greatest Generation.
  Published by Penguin Random House.
Vonnegut was forced to do manual labor in Dresden, and he survived the firebombing of the city in February 1945 by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. 8th Air Force. The resulting firestorm killed perhaps 35,000 people. “Slaughterhouse Five” is superficially science fiction, but it’s really about the insanity of war, the absurdity of surviving one, and more than anything, PTSD. Vonnegut’s writing will last forever because he’s irreverent, funny, and accessible, but he’s also honest and fundamentally decent.
That’s why Vonnegut appeals to younger readers; kids aren’t just picky eaters; they are picky readers. You have to meet them where they are in terms of attitude, interest, and style. By removing some of the most popular books among young people — classics and newer books alike — the district is depriving students of great books but also the love of reading and learning itself.
And as a rule, if you’re banning books, you’re afraid of ideas: The Soviets were afraid of capitalism, religion, and freedom of speech. The Nazis loathed the Jews, “inferior” races, modernism in all its forms, and were racist to their core. The Inquisition banned or targeted works by Copernicus and Galileo and Giordano Bruno because they feared their monopoly on cosmology was at an end. The ideas that Booklooks, and by extension, The St. Francis School Board, fear are plain. Even the most cursory look at its anonymous “ratings” (available on Internet Archive) shows that the books it targets are by or about women, LGBTQ folks, Black and brown folks, or people who have a “different” point of view. Like any attempt at censorship, it’s an exercise in erasure.
But I can promise you this: It won’t work. As the packed school board meetings, recent student protests, and a pair of newly filed lawsuits against the district make clear, people care about the freedom to read, the First Amendment, and the books and characters they love. 
This misguided policy has already been an expensive debacle, and the district has made statewide news in the most embarrassing way. If the policy remains in force, it will continue to hurt the district’s own students by depriving them of great works of art, and worse, giving them an incomplete, myopic view of the world.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/St.-Francis-Banned-Books-1-1024x868.jpg,,,2025-04-21 10:05:53.445210

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

A recent court order could put the money back in circulation, but the administration has yet to signal if it will fully comply. U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2019 during his first term in office, ordered the administration to release the funding last week. 
The following day, the administration filed notice that it intends to comply with the nationwide order. On Sunday, however, the organizations that sued over the funding freeze filed their own notice, saying that the grant funds “remain inaccessible” even after McElroy’s order. 
Angela Ehlers is the executive director of the South Dakota Association of Conservation Districts. Her organziation is not a party to the lawsuit, but has been awarded some of the funds now in dispute and works closely with other grantees affected by the executive order.
The money flowed through the Inflation Reduction Act, and were paused under direction from the U.S. Department of Agriculture after a Jan. 20 executive order from President Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act was authorized by Congress and signed into law under former President Joe Biden in 2022.
Ehlers said there’s been no clear sign of if or when they’ll be restored since the Jan. 20 0rder, which has been a frustration for those relying on them.
“These aren’t regulatory programs,” Ehlers emphasized. “They’re voluntary, and the fact that they’ve been frozen without explanation creates a chilling effect across the entire landscape.”
The pause impacted billions in conservation spending nationwide and sparked the lawsuit that led to last week’s order from Judge McElroy. Projects designed to support beginning farmers have also stalled. 


DOGE cuts in SD
This is part of a series on the impact of mass federal firings, funding freezes and grant cancellations in South Dakota. For future and prior reporting, see Searchlight’s DOGE in SD page.


Ehlers said her association had partnered with South Dakota State University to support young producers entering agriculture through sheep and goat production. The grant-funded effort is meant to offer a way into agriculture for young producers but doubles as a conservation measure, because sheep and goat production requires less land and capital than cattle or grain farming.
“There’s a real opportunity here,” Ehlers said, but added “we just don’t know” if the grant funding will continue.
Leaders in water quality and habitat restoration programming along the Big Sioux River are in  a similar wait-and-see scenario.
Most watershed project funding remains available, according to Jay Gilbertson, manager of the East Dakota Water Development District. But staff losses and hiring freezes have undercut the delivery of on-the-ground support.
“Even if you don’t reduce the program funding, who’s going to do the work?” Gilbertson said. “If you fire someone who’s approving payments or working directly with farmers, it creates a massive gap in capacity.”
Travis Entenman, director of Northern Prairies Land Trust and Friends of the Big Sioux River, said the downstream impacts of federal uncertainty are already reaching local landowners. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which helps farmers and ranchers integrate conservation into their operations, has seen funding pauses, he said. That’s left some landowners without reimbursement for practices they installed on the promise of repayment.
“Some of it’s open, but there’s still money frozen,” Entenman said. “And these programs are often receipt-based, meaning landowners put their own money on the line expecting reimbursement.”



Frozen conservation funds in limbo:
$51 million in climate-smart agriculture projects:

$25 million to Ducks Unlimited to restore 25,000 acres of grassland and help ranchers better manage grazing.
$18.3 million to South Dakota Agricultural Land Trust to offer easement payments to conserve 8,000 acres of ranchland near the Black Hills.
$8 million to South Dakota State University to help farmers identify unprofitable acres and suggest better land uses.

$83 million in grassland and conservation grants:

$24 million to Pheasants Forever & Quail Forever to use prescribed fire to remove invasive Eastern red cedar trees and restore prairie grasses on up to 125,000 acres.
$21 million to InterTribal Buffalo Council to restore native grassland ecosystems using sustainable buffalo grazing practices across tribal lands.
$20 million to The Nature Conservancy to purchase voluntary conservation easements on 20,000 acres in western South Dakota to prevent development.
$11 million to South Dakota Second Century Habitat Fund to convert low-quality cropland into grasslands suitable for grazing and haying.
$5 million to The Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance to identify and restore marginal croplands across 16 tribal nations.
$1.2 million to The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate to create a tool to measure the environmental impact of agriculture on the reservation.

Volcanoes inspire awe with spectacular eruptions and incandescent rivers of lava, but often their deadliest hazard is what quietly falls from the sky.
When a large volcano erupts, as Mount Spurr appears close to doing about 80 miles from Anchorage, Alaska, it can release enormous volumes of ash. Fine ash can infiltrate the lungs of people and animals who breathe it in, poison crops and disrupt aquatic life. Thick deposits of ash can collapse roofs, cripple utilities and disrupt transport networks.
Ash may lack the visual impact of flowing lava, but as a geologist who studies disasters, I’m aware that ash travels farther, lasts longer and leaves deep scars.

Volcanic ash: What it is, and why it matters
Volcanic ash forms when viscous magma – molten rock from deep beneath Earth’s surface – erupts, exploding into shards of rock, mineral and glass carried in a near-supersonic stream of hot gas.
Towering clouds of ash rise several miles into the atmosphere, where the ash is captured by high-altitude winds that can carry it hundreds or even thousands of miles.
As the volcanic ash settles back to Earth, it accumulates in layers that typically decrease in thickness with distance from the eruption source. Near the vent, the ash may be several feet deep, but communities farther away may see only a dusting.

  When Mount Spurr erupted in 1992, a dark column of ash and gas shot into the atmosphere from the volcano’s Crater Peak vent. Wind patterns determine where the ash will fall. (U.S. Geological Survey photo)

Breathing danger: Health risks from ash
Breathing volcanic ash can irritate the throat and lungs, trigger asthma attacks and aggravate chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD.
The finest particles pose the greatest risk because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause death by asphyxiation in the worst cases. Mild, short-term symptoms often resolve with rest. However, the long-term consequences of ash exposure can include silicosis, a lung disease and a possible cause of cancer.
The danger increases in dry regions where fallen ash can be kicked up into the air again by wind or human activity.
Risks to pets and livestock
Humans aren’t the only ones at risk. Animals experience similar respiratory symptoms to humans.
Domestic pets can develop respiratory distress, eye inflammation and paw irritation from exposure to ash.

	Livestock face greater dangers. If grazing animals eat volcanic ash, it can damage their teeth, block their intestines and poison them.
During the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland, farmers were advised to shelter sheep and cattle because the ash contained fluoride concentrations above the recognized safety threshold of 400 parts per million. Animals that remained exposed became sick and some died.
Harm to crops, soil and water
Soil and crops can also be damaged. Volcanic ash alters the acidity of soil and introduces harmful elements such as arsenic and sulfur into the environment.
While the ash can add nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus that enhance fertility, the immediate impact is mostly harmful.
Ash can smother crops, block sunlight and clog the tiny stomata, or pores, in leaves that allow plants to exchange gases with the atmosphere. It can also introduce toxins that render food unmarketable. Vegetables, fruit trees and vines are particularly vulnerable, but even sturdy cereals and grasses can die if ash remains on leaves or poisons emerging shoots.
Following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, vast tracts of farmland in central Luzon in the Philippines were rendered unproductive for years due to acidic ash and buried topsoil. If multiple ashfalls occur in a growing season, crop failure becomes a near certainty. It was the cause of a historic famine that followed the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815.

Top right is an ash particle from Mount St. Helens magnified 200 times. The shards in the lower images are less than 0.064 mm. (Volcano Hazards Program, U.S. Geological Survey photo)


	Ash can also contaminate surface water by introducing toxins and increasing the water’s acidity. The toxins can leach into groundwater, contaminating wells. Fine ash particles can also settle in waterways and smother aquatic plants and animals. During the 2008 Chaitén eruption in Chile, ash contamination led to widespread fish deaths in the Río Blanco.
Ash can ground airplanes, gum up infrastructure
Ash clouds are extremely dangerous to aircraft. The glassy ash particles melt when sucked into jet turbines, clog fuel systems and can stall engines in midair.
In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 lost power in all four engines after flying through an ash cloud. A similar incident occurred in 1989 to KLM Flight 867 over Alaska. In 2010, Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull eruption grounded more than 100,000 flights across Europe, disrupting travel for over 10 million passengers and costing the global economy billions of dollars.
Volcanic ash can also wreak havoc on infrastructure by clogging water supplies, short-circuiting electrical systems and collapsing roofs under its weight. It can disrupt transportation, communication, rescue and power networks, as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines dramatically demonstrated.
What to do during ashfall
During an ashfall event, the most effective strategy to stay safe is to stay indoors as much as possible and avoid inhaling ash particles.
Anyone who must go outside should wear a properly fitted N95 or P2 mask. Cloth masks provide little protection against fine ash. Rainwater tanks, troughs and open wells should be covered and monitored for contamination. Livestock should be moved to clean pastures or given uncontaminated fodder.
To reduce structural damage, ash should be cleared from roofs and gutters promptly, especially before rainfall.
Older adults, children and people who are sick are at greatest risk, particularly those living in poorly ventilated homes. Rural communities that are dependent on agriculture and livestock are disproportionately affected by ashfall, as are low-income people who lack access to clean water, protective masks or safe shelter.
Communities can stay informed about ash risks through official alerts, including those from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers, which monitor ash dispersion and issue timely warnings. The International Volcanic Health Hazard Network also offers guidelines on personal protection, emergency planning and ash cleanup.
The long tail of ash
Volcanic ash may fall quietly, but its effects are widespread, persistent and potentially deadly. It poses a chronic threat to health, agriculture, infrastructure and aquatic systems.
Recognizing the risk is a crucial first step to protecting lives. Effective planning and public awareness can further help reduce the damage.

By the end of last summer, CalMatters data reporter Jeremia Kimelman recognized that 2024 was on its way to break lobbying spending records in California. With the year concluded and recent data filed with the secretary state, lobbying groups indeed spent an unrivaled amount of money in 2024 to influence state government: $540 million, or 10% more than the year before.
So who were the biggest spenders? 
Topping the list were oil companies, which were the main focus of a special session Gov. Gavin Newsom called last summer to address gas prices. The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million in advocacy costs in 2024 — including more than $10 million spent last summer. 
Electric company PacifiCorp and utility company Pacific Gas & Electric also spent big last year: PacifiCorp reported spending more than $13.4 million — about 30 times its yearly average in the last two decades — while Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $3.6 million.
But one standout is the tech and search giant Google, which poured $11.9 million into state-level lobbying in 2024 — more than it spent in the last 20 years combined. Last summer it successfully opposed two bills related to funding journalism and artificial intelligence regulations.
Given the state’s prominence as having one of the largest economies in the world, half a billion dollars in lobbying spending isn’t too surprising for some political and economic experts. During the 2023-24 legislative session, California also saw its biggest spike in registered lobbyists in more than a decade.

Thomas Holyoke, political science professor at Fresno State University: “More and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously.”

CA spared from other research funding cuts, for now

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
Another federal cut to university research, another lawsuit — and yet another judge halting the cuts for now.
While the proposed research cuts to universities by the National Institutes of Health have been a top concern for campuses, other federal agencies are big funders of research, too. The Department of Energy provided the University of California $162 million in research funding last year for 393 projects.The department under President Donald Trump wanted to cap a major source of that funding, called indirect costs, to 15% — much lower than the existing negotiated rates between campuses and the federal agency. The government said the move would save taxpayers $400 million annually. A coalition of universities and higher-education associations, which count UCs as members, sued last week. Days after, a federal Massachusetts judge temporarily halted the cuts. Indirect costs cover expenses to maintain labs and other major infrastructure for research.Calculating the true cost of those proposed Department of Energy losses for the UC is difficult, but the NIH also sought to lower those indirect rates to 15%. One calculation found that the UC would lose $460 million out of about $2.6 billion in funding the system gets for health science research annually.In the Department of Energy suit, California Institute of Technology indicated it spent $25 million on Department of Energy projects. A 15% cut to indirect costs would mean $6 million in losses for the school.



CA consumer group sues to prevent insurance surcharge

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
A consumer advocacy group sued the California Insurance Department last week because the state agency allowed private insurers to pass a $500 million surcharge to their customers.
The FAIR Plan — a state-mandated association of insurers that’s required to provide fire insurance to property owners who can’t get it elsewhere — asked the insurance department to approve a $1 billion “assessment” to help prop it up after the Los Angeles County fires, saying the plan was running out of money. The insurers in the plan are required to fund the assessment. But under two bulletins issued by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara last fall and in February, insurers for the first time can recoup half of their cost by imposing fees on their customers — who are not on the FAIR Plan. 
CalMatters reported in February that Consumer Watchdog was considering legal action. It filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, saying Lara violated one law that requires public comment on a regulation and review by the Office of Administrative Law. In addition, the group said Lara violated the state’s insurance code by “effectively (requiring) every California policyholder to reinsure their own insurer.” It asks the court to declare the bulletins invalid, and to order the insurance department to facilitate the return of any fees on insurance customers so far. 
Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesperson for the insurance department, said the lawsuit “fails to benefit consumers.” The insurance industry also slammed the lawsuit.

Denni Ritter, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association: “It is critical that the costs be spread equitably across a broader pool of insured customers.”

,California,2025-04-21 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year,Jeremia Kimelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/data/2025/04/california-lobbying-spending-2024/,"Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.","In summary
Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.


Lobbying groups spent more than half a billion dollars to influence the state government in 2024, the most ever, according to a CalMatters analysis of data recently filed with the secretary of state. Lobbying by Google, oil companies and utilities during special sessions in the third quarter appeared to drive the sharp spike in spending.
Companies and organizations reported roughly $540 million in lobbying expenses to push their point of view to California officials, including legislators, on hundreds of bills between January and December of last year — and that’s up by more than 10% from $485 million in 2023.

Perhaps that isn’t so surprising in a state with a full-time Legislature and one of the largest economies in the world, said Francesco Trebbi, an economics professor at UC Berkeley who studies political influence and lobbying.
“Half a billion is kind of normal,” he said. “If California is about 14% of U.S. GDP and federal lobbying is about $4 billion, $500 million is about 13% of that. So it would be in line with the size of the California economy.”
Thomas Holyoke, a professor of political science at Fresno State University, said that the spending increase might reflect not only corporations’ desire for more influence but also the growing influence of California policy itself.
As long as California maintains its prominence, “more and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously,” he said.
 
 

Major players driving the lobbying boom
The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million dollars in advocacy costs over the year, more than $10 million of which was spent last summer, and more than double the total bill of the previous year.
The organization took public positions on 18 bills last session and got its desired outcome two-thirds of the time, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from Digital Democracy, our platform to track state lawmakers and legislation.
In part, the trade group’s spending more than doubled because of increased proposed regulations on oil and gas, including a special session focused on gas prices.
The largest non-oil spender was PacifiCorp, which reported spending more than $13.4 million to influence California officials last year, 30 times the yearly average for the company over the last two decades. The investor-owned utility lobbied for a rate hike but didn’t take a public position on any bills in 2024.
Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the largest utilities in the state, reported nearly $3.6 million on lobbying last year. Over the two-year legislative session, the company took a public position on 45 bills and also got its way on roughly two-thirds of them, or 31 bills.
Google doesn’t usually spend much on state-level lobbying efforts but spent more in 2024 than the last 20 years combined.

The company reported one of the largest totals for state advocacy last year, driven primarily by a spending spree in the third quarter of the year when the tech giant was fighting a media bill and AI regulations. The company got its way in both cases.
Much of its advocacy went through the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which reported spending nearly $7.4 million, $7 million of which came from the Mountain View behemoth.
Only two labor groups spent more than $1 million on lobbying last year: the Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association.
SEIU reported spending nearly $3.4 million and the California Teachers Association, another powerful union in the state, spent more than $3.1 million. Both unions took public positions on hundreds of bills and got their way nearly 70% of the time.

How CalMatters analyzed the data
Organizations that hire lobbyists to influence state policy are required to disclose how much money was spent in a quarterly report to the secretary of state, who makes the data and filings available online. For example, the page for the Western States Petroleum Association shows that the industry group spent roughly $1.7 million on advocacy in the second quarter of last year and more than $10.1 million in the following quarter.
CalMatters added quarterly reported expenses to calculate the total annual lobbying bill for each organization, then added every organization’s yearly sum to determine the aggregate amount spent on lobbying California officials per year.
Sometimes, organizations give money to industry groups to lobby on their behalf, such as the $7 million Google paid to the Computer & Communications Industry Association, and both organizations must report that money: Google, when it buys advocacy services from the association; the trade group, when it actually spends the money on grassroots organizing or direct lobbying. Because there’s no way to determine if a payment is to another “lobbyist employer” or to a political or media consulting firm, there are amounts reported more than once in our data.
CalMatters determined the success rate of each organization by comparing organizations’ public positions taken on bills in the last legislative session (2023–2024) as recorded in Digital Democracy to the ultimate outcome of that legislation. Lobbying efforts were considered successful if either of the following were true:

The organization opposed a bill that failed the Legislature.
The organization supported a bill that passed through the Legislature (even if it was vetoed by the Governor).

It’s difficult to get a more detailed picture of lobbying because of what isn’t reported in the data. California does not require disclosure of either the offices or staff members who meet with lobbyists or the connections between individual lobbyists and specific bills.
Our analysis found that corporate lobbying efforts were successful about 60% of the time. This is likely an undercount because it can take more than one year to successfully pass a bill.
Micheli said that sometimes a bill can even take more than one two-year legislative session.
“After six or seven years on a really tough bill, you finally get it enacted. Leading up to it, you could say you failed every year,” he said. “But then eventually, you get a seismic change in the law.”

According to a news release, Ellison has served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico in the Las Cruces Branch Office, most recently as supervisory assistant U.S. attorney of the Violent and General Crimes Section. In that capacity, a news release notes, Ellison prosecuted members of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, with more than 175 SNM gang members and associates thus far charged with serious federal crimes, “making the ongoing SNM prosecution the largest criminal case ever brought in the District of New Mexico.”
“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of New Mexico in this role,” Ellison said in a statement. “For however long I serve as United States Attorney, my primary objective will be to keep New Mexicans safe through the vigorous enforcement of Federal law. Under my leadership, the United States Attorney’s Office will do its part to stem the unlawful flow of people and drugs into our country.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, the State House’s longest-serving member, died early Monday morning following a battle with cancer, according to a statement from his office. He was 76.
“It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing of Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio earlier this morning,” the statement said. “We are so grateful for the love and support of his friends and colleagues. Throughout his illness, Donny fought valiantly, just as he always had for his constituents and the residents of Rhode Island.”
The North Providence Democrat was hospitalized at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital last week for a bad reaction to his treatment — returning less than five weeks after he was released from the same hospital and rehabilitation center for pneumonia. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said he was “heartbroken,” referring to Ruggerio as his “dear friend” in a statement Monday morning.
“I had enormous respect and admiration for his dedication and leadership,” Shekarchi said.  “Even through his illness, we communicated on nearly a daily basis about the important issues facing our state. Donny devoted his life to the people of Rhode Island, which will always be his legacy. This is the end of an era at the State House, where Donny was a true giant for well over four decades, beginning his career in the House in 1981 before moving to the Senate four years later.  On behalf of the House of Representatives, we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and his Senate colleagues, and we will miss him greatly.”
Ruggerio was absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25.
Similar stretches of absence also characterized his leadership of the upper chamber in 2024, prompting a rival bid for the president role from his former second-in-command, Sen. Ryan Pearson. Ruggerio fended off the challenge with two-thirds of the votes of the Senate’s 34 Democrats. Despite his multiple absences, supporters remained steadfast in their public conviction that Ruggerio was the best pick to lead the chamber.
First elected to represent District 4 spanning parts of Providence and North Providence in 1985, Ruggerio, known to friends and colleagues as “Donny” was considered the “dean” of the Senate as its longest-serving member. The retired administrator for the New England Laborers Labor Management Coop Trust was tapped as majority whip in 2003. He ascended to Senate Majority Leader in 2010 and in 2017, was elected Senate President after former President Teresa Paiva Weed suddenly resigned.
A self-described moderate Democrat, Ruggerio leaned more conservative on gun and abortion issues, though his mindset shifted in his later years in leadership. In 2023, Ruggerio cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee that allowed the Equality in Abortion Coverage Act to advance to the full Senate, where it also passed and was signed into law. This year, he signaled new openness to a state assault weapons ban, which he previously opposed.
He was a strong voice for labor, small business and expanding the state’s legal gambling sector, leading the way for the state’s online sports betting in 2019 and in 2023, virtual slot and table games, or iGaming.
His biography on the General Assembly website highlights his recognition from The Humane Society of the United States, recognizing his efforts to prohibit double-decker horse trailers, as one of the standouts from his many awards and honors.
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio graduated from LaSalle Academy in 1966. He attended Bryant College, but earned a bachelor’s degree in 1974 from Providence College.
He served on the board of the Wanskuck Library and as a member of the Sons of Italy, Loggia Vittoria, and the DaVinci Center Development Committee.
Ruggerio was the father of two children, Charles and Amanda, with his ex-wife, Cynthia, and the grandfather to Ava, Mia, Natalie, and Jameson.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)As temperatures soared past 100 degrees in early October, Yajaira Rimendes, a 35-year-old former nurse, started to feel faint at a bus stop in North Las Vegas. It was midday and she was on her way to a chemotherapy appointment. She drank her only remaining water, which was already lukewarm, and passed out.
“I don’t remember much, but from what I remember I woke up in a hospital,” Rimendes said.
She was one of more than 3,500 heat-related emergency hospital visits reported in Southern Nevada last year, according to the Southern Nevada Health District. 
Last year Nevada experienced the hottest summer on record, and even into October, daily heat records were broken, triggering a re-activation of cooling centers. Temperatures on Oct. 4 reached 104 degrees, breaking the record for the hottest day ever recorded for the month.
Extended triple degree temperatures in 2024 also brought a surge of fatalities. State health officials recorded 526 heat-related deaths in Southern Nevada last year, a 78% increase from the 294 heat-related deaths in 2023.
After a record number of heat related deaths and hospitalizations in the state, lawmakers are considering measures this session designed to protect Nevadans whose vulnerability to heat is only rising with temperatures.
Rimendes joined dozens of Las Vegas residents on a trip to Carson City with the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition this month — traveling more than 400 miles — to push for several bills that would help Nevadans adapt and thrive as record-breaking temperatures and wildfire impact every aspect of their lives. 
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat, in some cases with fatal consequences.
At face value, policies to protect against the consequences of climate change seem like an obvious necessity, but lack of funding combined with fiercely anti-regulatory corporate interests and like-minded elected officials have made climate-related legislation difficult to pass.
One example is Assembly Bill 96, a measure that would mandate the Clark and Washoe counties, the state’s two most populous, to include a specific “heat mitigation” section within their development master plans. That would mean actively addressing extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas.
Nevada’s Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in 2023. His reasoning was that there’s “no data definitively supporting the proposition that development is causing rising temperatures in either Washoe County or Clark County.” 
In reality, one of the major consequences of urban development is the urban heat island that results in cities being, on average, warmer than adjacent rural landscapes. As natural land and vegetation is replaced by dark and heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, the urban heat island is amplified at night when stored daytime heat is emitted even when the sun is down.

After 18 years of living in Nevada, Rimendes said the heat feels different than it did even five years ago. It’s more persistent, and her mobile home is no longer effective enough at creating a barrier from the intensity of the summer heat in North Las Vegas.
Her observation is backed by data. From 2010 to 2019, the low temperature in Las Vegas increased by 7 degrees, according to the nonpartisan Climate Central research and communications group. Much of that increase can be attributed to explosive development in Las Vegas since the 1970s.
A recent comparative study of cities by the U.S. Geological Survey found that nearly 50% of the Las Vegas metro area was covered by heat-absorbing buildings, roads and sidewalks — more than any other city in the study — contributing to significantly higher air temperatures in the area. 
Nothing but a pole for shade
Nevada’s capital—where the Legislature meets once every two years— is 431 miles away from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, where seven out of ten Nevadans live. That’s farther than Las Vegas to Phoenix. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Los Angeles.
Tollis Hill, a Las Vegas resident, packed into the Carson City office of Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas) with a dozen other Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition members to advocate for more action on climate change. 
Hill traveled with Chispa Nevada from Las Vegas to advocate for Senate Bill 260, a measure that would ensure that outdoor workers receive the protection when air quality reaches unhealthy levels due to the wildfire smoke. It was his first time ever going to Carson City or speaking to lawmakers. 
Nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s land area has been burned by wildfire in the past 40 years, landing the state fifth in the nation for land area burned by wildfires. More frequent and destructive wildfires have also impacted air quality for outdoor workers in the state from Reno to Las Vegas. Despite growing destructive wildfires in the state, there are currently no regulations to protect workers air quality during extreme weather events. 
Hill spent 15 years working casino security on the Las Vegas Strip, including seven years as an outside bike officer. He recalled times the air quality was so bad during wildfires that he couldn’t stop coughing and had to rely on an inhaler. 
“In 2022, when Southern Nevada was filled with wildfire smoke, my coworkers and I were still outside working. We were not provided the needed personal protective equipment, and using what we had was discouraged as it did not meet the company’s uniform code,” Hill said.

Members of the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition split up to speak to different legislators in order to maximize their lobbying time. They also provided comments during legislative hearings that coincided with their trip to Carson City.
Rimendes, the 35-year-old former nurse who is fighting cancer, has practiced telling her story in an effective and compelling way in 2-minutes or less — the time allotted by legislative committees to an individual to submit public comment on legislation during a hearing. 
There’s no guarantee any of the bills the coalition supports will make it into law at the end of the 120-day legislative session, despite lobbying efforts by coalition members. Alternatively, the measures could be approved, but in a much different form than what was originally proposed.
One example is Senate Bill 431. The measure’s original goal was to extend the state’s 9% live entertainment tax to sports teams ticket sales, which are currently exempted from the tax.  The bill would have dedicated the revenue to Nevada’s woefully underfunded public transit. 
State Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), the bill’s sponsor, said if passed as originally written the bill could have brought the state $54.5 million in revenue. That funding could be used to improve transit wait times, upgrade bus shelters to provide shade, and expand routes.
Rimendes relies heavily on public transit, even on days when temperatures soar past 100 degrees. That means at times Rimendes is forced to wait up to an hour at a bus stop with nothing but a pole for shade. Drive past any major road in Las Vegas and you’ll find several bus stops without trees or shelters to keep people cool as they stand on hot concrete near a sizzling asphalt road.
“There isn’t any shade, there aren’t any benches, there’s no trees. Imagine 110 degree weather, standing out there in scorching hot sun,” Rimendes said. 
The bill was opposed by Golden Knights, a pro league hockey team, and the Reno Aces, a pro baseball team, each saying the bill would raise ticket prices.
Neal acknowledged it was “controversial” during a hearing while Rimendes and other Nevadans who had traveled from Las Vegas sat in the gallery.
“I apologize to the committee who will sit through lots and lots of opposition,” Neal said. 
Days later, the bill was stripped down during a work session, narrowing the live entertainment tax to only the resale of sports teams tickets. And instead of $54.5 million to improve public transit infrastructure, the bill is projected to generate $36.5 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/story3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108
,California,2025-04-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers can do a lot to aid LA fire recovery. Steeper looting penalties aren’t part of that,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/looting-penalties-los-angeles-fires/,"There were relatively few arrests inside evacuation zones during this year's LA firestorm, yet California legislators have put looting center stage. The bills would mostly enhance already-stiff penalties, raising questions about why Democrats are making such a fuss.","It is noteworthy that some of the earliest mentions of “looting” in news reports during this year’s deadly fires in Los Angeles County made the point that there actually wasn’t much of it.
Video circulated on social media purporting to show young Black men stealing goods from a home in Altadena during the Eaton Fire. But the claim was quickly debunked by KTLA reporter Chip Yost, who spoke to the impacted family and noted that the young men were residents of the house and their neighbors, who were quickly removing and bagging as much of their possessions as they could before the flames could destroy everything.
Similar scenes played out all over Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other areas hard hit by the fires that began on Jan. 7 and spread quickly amid hurricane-force winds. Neighbors pitched in to help save pets, pictures, important documents and personal items.
It’s a fairly typical response during disaster emergencies like wildfires. Neighbors tend to come together. Looting, although not unusual during violent social uprisings, is rare during natural disasters.
But fears and false reports of looting are common.
The Los Angeles Police Department, whose jurisdiction includes Pacific Palisades, took to social media in the hours after fires broke out to rebut looting rumors. 
“At this time,” the LAPD said on X, “we have received no information regarding looting or other criminal activity in the affected areas.”
As the fires were beaten back, some people did come to the reeling neighborhoods to take advantage of the disaster, allegedly stealing goods from intact or partially destroyed homes, or in some cases sifting through ash for any valuables that somehow remained unburned. 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reported six arrests for burglary, three for grand theft and seven for entering a disaster area in Altadena; and one for burglary, two for attempted burglary and one for possession of burglary tools in Malibu. The Los Angeles, Pasadena and Santa Monica police departments also made arrests in fire zones, including some for looting, but also for arson, flying unauthorized drones, possession of illegal drugs or weapons, and other non-looting-related crimes. Arrests in the evacuation areas for all crimes hovered at around 100. 
In a disaster in which at least 30 people died, and in a county of 10 million people, that’s a rather low number and does not point to a widespread outbreak of looting during the fires and the immediate aftermath.
Read More: New fire maps put nearly 4 million Californians in hazardous zones. What does that mean for the people who live there?
So it’s maddening that so many members of the California Legislature have put looting center stage, pushing bills to lengthen jail and prison sentences for theft during emergencies. It’s a misdirection of public time, effort and money. And it glosses over the deep governmental failures that the fires exposed: The failure to send timely emergency evacuation orders to the west side of Altadena where at least 18 people died. The needlessly nerve-wracking false emergency warning sent to millions of county residents not affected by the fires. The lack of available water to fight the fires. Plus questions about inadequate brush clearance and confusion over just who was in charge of disaster response.
Senate Bill 571 by Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Jesse Arreguín of Oakland will be heard Tuesday in the Senate Public Safety Committee. Assembly Bill 468 by Assemblymembers Jesse Gabriel of Encino, Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks and Blanca Pacheco of Downey passed out of the Assembly Public Safety Committee earlier this month and comes to the Appropriations Committee Wednesday.
All of the lead authors are Democrats and most are considered among the Legislature’s more progressive members. Parallel bills have been authored by Republican members.
The bills differ in their details but all are based on the specious premise that lengthening sentences — in some cases by four months, in others by a year or two — would dissuade would-be perpetrators who are not discouraged by current looting penalties.
California’s history with anti-looting laws
What is looting? As used in California law, it means stealing during a declared emergency or in an evacuation zone. Although charged as a distinct crime rather than as a sentence enhancement, it can lengthen sentences for charges like residential burglary, grand theft and petty theft — crimes that already carry stiff penalties. Residential burglary, for example, is a felony that carries a sentence of up to six years in state prison. AB 468 would make that seven years. 
It’s hard to imagine a perpetrator thinking, “I’m ready to do six years, but seven? No way. I’ll pass.”
California law also already increases the minimum penalty for petty theft during an emergency and virtually guarantees jail time. These bills would further strip judges of authority to order no-jail probation based on individual circumstances.
The state’s political foes often claim, falsely, that California is a soft on crime state. For example, after Gov. Gavin Newsom approved Los Angeles County’s request to deploy the National Guard to help patrol evacuation zones, Elon Musk amplified an absurd post on X, the platform he owns, that California had previously “literally decriminalized looting.”
In fact, at least two people arrested after allegedly stealing from an evacuated house in Mandeville Canyon during the Palisades fire reportedly could face life sentences under the state’s notoriously tough three strikes law because they have two prior serious or violent felony convictions. That’s not even including the longer sentences under current looting laws, let alone new penalties put in place if the bills become law. 
California is one of only eight states with anti-looting laws. Of those, most were adopted amid 1960s race riots, but California adopted its laws after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. There were only a few reports of theft during the emergency, but it was in the midst of the state’s tough-on-crime era and longer sentences were popular.
The remaining 42 states prosecute and sentence thieves and vandals the same whether they commit their crimes during a state of emergency or during normal times. There is no data to support the notion that theft increases during disasters or in evacuation zones, or that any such increase, if it did exist, would be controlled by special looting-related sentences.
In fact, there is little data to suggest that longer sentences have any impact on crime at all. The authors of California’s latest anti-looting bills surely know that if they have read the reports of their own legislative analysts.
So why are supposedly progressive Democrats pushing so hard to pointlessly adopt longer sentences for thefts committed during emergencies?
It may be that they feel pressure to hold someone — anyone — accountable for the overwhelming pain and loss. They recently scuttled a bill to allow fire victims to sue oil companies for their role in climate change, because it was opposed by their allies in labor. It would be likewise politically hazardous to target emergency workers for failed warning systems, or insurance companies for onerous recovery procedures. But accused thieves make popular targets, even though they had nothing to do with the fires.
The bills also allow Democrats to continue burnishing the tough-on-crime credentials they sought last year with a legislative package to toughen sentences for shoplifters. But retail theft dropped because of stepped-up investigation and enforcement, not because of longer prison or jail terms. 
Besides, criminal sentences don’t give their constituents what they need.
In Altadena, which historically has a large Black community, members of the Essie Justice Group made more than 500 calls to ask residents how they’re doing and what they need from their elected officials to better support their recovery. They’re still analyzing their responses, but so far, group member Sadio Woods said, “Zero percent of those folks said anything about crime or looting.”
Woods did note that some residents who returned home were stopped by officials and “questioned as looters.”
That recalls the false rumors circulated by social media about supposed looters who were actually friends and family helping to save precious belongings. And it raises a troubling but undeniable concern about the effect of racism during disasters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_55.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108

Carlos Trujillo couldn’t sleep despite it being well past midnight. 
As both an immigrant and an immigration lawyer, Trujillo has been acutely tuned into the volatile nature of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. That night, in the early hours of April 11, as has often been the case lately, Trujillo’s mind drifted to worries about how the changes will impact his clients and what he can do to assist them. 
Those thoughts weren’t helped by an email that arrived in his inbox at 1 a.m. The opening line got straight to the point. 
“It is time for you to leave the United States,” reads the email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It ends with a promise: “The federal government will find you.”
Trujillo initially assumed the email was for one of his clients. Then he realized the only name on the email was his own. 
“I was in a little bit of a shock,” said Trujillo, who became a citizen over a decade ago. “I was like, why is this happening?”

Trujillo is one of several U.S. citizens on the receiving end of what appears to have been a mass email campaign. The emails stated that the recipients’ parole had been terminated. But Trujillo has never had immigration parole, which allows immigrants to temporarily remain and, in some cases, work in the country. It is separate from the kind of parole used in a criminal justice context. 
Immigration lawyers in Massachusetts, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a doctor in Connecticut — all of whom are also citizens — reported receiving the same email as Trujillo. 
Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement that it used the “known email addresses” of immigrants to send the notices, which it acknowledged could have included immigration attorneys’ emails. 
“If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the statement reads. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”
A broader strategy 
To Trujillo, the motivation behind the emails is clear.
“This is part of a new practice, and the practice is to instill fear in the Latino or the minority communities,” Trujillo said. “Why am I a part of the email? Was it a mistake? Was it that I am born and raised in Venezuela? I don’t know. It could be, because I know there have been mistaken communications by DHS, but because I don’t know — that unknown makes you worry.”
Maria Montes with Comunidades Unidas said the administration’s constantly changing policies have made it difficult for the nonprofit and other organizations to effectively respond within their communities. 
“The federal administration has organized a strategy to create chaos, confusion and fear all in the hopes that immigrants will choose to self deport,” Montes said. 
Trujillo has been an outspoken advocate for Utah’s immigrant community. He said he refuses to accept that his advocacy was linked to the email, although it did cross his mind.

“To think that there could be consequences for that in a country like the United States, I just can’t believe it,” he said. “It probably was a mistake, and I love this country so much that I think my first inclination is just to believe that and leave it at that. But if it is something else. Well, here I am. I know who I am and what I stand for. And I understand what this country stands for and I am staying put.”
The emails are part of a broader immigration strategy aimed at revoking visas, asylum, parole and temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. A specialized immigration task force within the Department of Government Efficiency is providing the technical infrastructure to make that strategy a reality, according to reporting by Politico. 
Like other DOGE mass email campaigns, the emails Trujillo and others received incited panic and confusion, especially since immigration notices have historically been sent through U.S. mail and online government portals. Before DHS publicly acknowledged the emails many online wrote them off as a scam. 
The switch to email is a recent one, Trujillo said. But his case and that of other citizens who mistakenly received the email call into question the reliability of using email. 
Trujillo’s email — which he shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project — lists the sender as “automatedmessage@cbp.dhs.gov.” Because the message came from an unrecognized address, it triggered an anti-phishing warning from his Outlook email service.
CBP did not respond to questions about how it is ensuring the notices get to the correct recipients and how many emails it accidentally sent to citizens. Instead, the agency said in a statement that it had issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain in the country. 
The statement clarified that those notices were not limited to just individuals who had used CBP One and that the notices do not currently apply to Ukrainian and Afghan immigrants with parole. 
“To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,” the statement reads. “We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.”

‘It’s heartbreaking’ 
Trujillo has written off the email as a mistake. But many aren’t so lucky. 
Jesus — who The Utah Investigative Journalism Project is referring to by only his first name because he fears speaking out may impact his immigration case — received a letter late last month that terminated his parole and authorization to work in the U.S. Unlike Trujillo, Jesus is not a citizen. 
“It literally destroyed me,” Jesus said in Spanish, “Because I’ve tried to do things legally in the U.S.”
The letter, which was shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project, directed Jesus, a BYU computer science student, to leave the U.S. by April 24 or face “adverse immigration consequences.”











It's heartbreaking. You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they're leaving.


– Utah attorney Carlos Trujillo



Jesus applied for asylum in the U.S. after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela. He entered the country legally in November 2023 through the humanitarian parole program. The Trump administration recently ended the program, which had benefited 532,000 people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. That decision is currently being challenged in court. 
“The phones blew up here,” Trujillo said, adding that over 50 of his clients have gotten letters telling them to leave the country. They range from newly arrived immigrants to individuals who have been in the U.S. for close to a decade.
“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they’re leaving.”
Trujillo and Montes encouraged immigrants to pursue their case with an immigration attorney, get informed of their rights and be brave about standing up for themselves and their communities. 
“There’s never been a scarier time to step up and to push back against such a powerful entity like our federal administration, but there’s also never been a more important time to do so,” Montes said.
Jesus is currently working with his immigration lawyers to stay in the country, but he worries daily of both the consequences of returning to Venezuela as well as the possibility of being detained by U.S. immigration officers. 
“My worry is that I go back and the persecution against me starts again,” he said in Spanish. “They could literally kill me.” 
All of these developments hit close to home for Trujillo. When he became a citizen, he remembers finally feeling like he had made it, like he didn’t need to worry anymore. 
“As an immigrant, you always feel unstable,” he said. “Here I am, 15 years later, and I’m worried about it again.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate approved two bills Thursday aimed at enhancing online safety for minors by requiring filters on new smartphones and tablets and mandating age verification for app store access.
Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the sponsor of the legislation, said on the Senate floor that the bills aim to prevent children from accessing potentially harmful content online.
“They try to protect children, the most vulnerable of our society … they do it in different ways, but it’s all about protecting children,” Chambliss said following the vote.

The first bill, SB 186, passed the chamber on a 28-5 vote. It would require that smartphones and tablets manufactured on or after June 1 and activated in Alabama include a pre-installed filter capable of blocking obscene material. During the device activation process, users will be asked their age and the filter will automatically be enabled if the user is identified as a minor who is under 18. Adults would be able to disable the filter using a password.
“We don’t even have to come up with a solution. It’s already there. It is already there. This bill is very simple. All it does is require those who manufacture these devices to turn the filter on if the device is enabled, activated for a child. That’s it in a nutshell,” he said on the Senate floor, adding that smartphones are already equipped with these filters.
The bill would allow parents or guardians to sue manufacturers for damages if a minor accesses obscene material due to non-compliance, and the Attorney General would also be able to pursue civil penalties against manufacturers.
The second bill, SB 187, which passed 26-6, would require app store to verify the age of individuals creating accounts in Alabama. The app store must obtain parental consent for users identified as minors before the minor can download or purchase apps or make in-app purchases. It would also prohibit developers from enforcing disclosures or terms of service on minors without parental consent.
“This is important because children, minors are not of an age and maturity and intellect to enter into these contracts, to read and understand these contracts. They’re hard enough for adults,” Chambliss said.
This legislation would require app store providers to share age category data with developers and notify parents of significant app changes, requiring renewed consent. The attorney general would have the right to pursue civil action for potentially deceptive trade practices, potentially leading to significant fines.
Chambliss said that similar legislation regarding app stores has advanced in other states, including one that was signed into law in Utah in March. Chambliss said that the Alabama bill was amended to align closely with Utah’s law.
“The point is to try to make it consistent across the states, and then, hopefully, when enough states adopt it, maybe Congress will adopt it, and we wouldn’t have a different law in every state,” Chambliss said.
Both bills move to the Alabama House of Representatives for consideration.

Stock.adobe.comHealth officials say the state is making progress on reducing a significant backlog of nursing home inspections, with more than half of facilities having received an inspection within the last 16 months.
But with some facilities being more than four years behind schedule for an inspection, advocates and lawmakers fear that some of Maryland’s seniors may be languishing in unsafe living conditions while the state works through its backlog.
“How do we hold owners of nursing homes accountable for the care in the places where these folks are staying?” asked Bruce Hartung, president of the Maryland Continuing Care Residents’ Association. “Without inspections, we simply have no idea how these folks are living — and in what conditions they are living.”
At issue is a years-old backlog of state inspections of the state’s 220 nursing homes as required by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The backlog has spanned administrations and was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Maryland ranks second to last in the nation when it comes to timely inspections of nursing homes, with average inspection lag of 2.44 years compared to the national average of 0.97 years, according to StarPro, which tracks data on nursing homes across the United States. Maryland falls behind only Alabama, which has an average lag of 3 years.
The state Department of Health has been struggling to catch up on those inspections since, with some facilities not receiving an annual inspection for four years or more, according to CMS data, though state officials note that the federal data may lag by a couple months.
Meanwhile, lawmakers and senior advocates worry that seniors could be facing unsafe living conditions without oversight or knowledge of state officials, and they passed legislation this session in hopes of keeping better tabs on the issue.
“These are the most vulnerable people in our population,” said Sen. Benjamin Kramer (D-Montgomery). “And nobody is putting eyes on the nursing home to ensure that these seniors are being properly cared for.”

Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 376, sponsored by Kramer, to boost the reporting requirements on the health department, so it will provide more frequent updates as it works through the inspection backlog.
Under SB376, which is currently on the governor’s desk, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports updating lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections throughout the state. The bill also prompts the Office of Health Care Quality to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
The nursing home inspection backlog was a hot topic throughout session.
Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, deputy secretary for the health department on public health, told lawmakers that the agency is making progress on the backlog, though he admitted there is still work to be done.
He said during a January briefing on the issue for the Senate Finance Committee that the estimated time to “catch up” on inspections will take about two more years, as the department has needed to train staff to conduct the inspections. Each inspection can take about a week to conduct.
In written testimony on SB376, the health department reported that as of March 31, there were 130 nursing homes out of a total 220, or 59%, that had an annual inspection conducted in the previous 16 months, the maximum time allowed by federal guidelines.  That’s an improvement from June, when the rate of annual inspections conducted within 16 months was just 21.2%, according to the department’s testimony.
Hank Greenberg, AARP Maryland state director, said that uninspected nursing homes can result in lower quality of care for seniors, who may not have a strong support system to help advocate for themselves against mistreatment or even abuse.
“This can result in preventable injuries, a decline in overall resident well-being, and really contributes to the fact that their could be abuse and neglect that don’t rise as quickly as they should,” he said. “And keeps people from being able to know that things will be addressed.”

A group of nursing home residents are already suing the Department of Health for neglect they allegedly experienced in living facilities, citing the backlog of nursing home inspections as a contributing factor to their experience.
The plaintiffs have mobility-related disabilities and rely on nursing staff for moving around the facility, eating, and personal hygiene. The lawsuit alleges that residents were often left unattended for extended periods, leaving them isolated from community events or sometimes left in soiled clothing for hours, among other concerns outlined in the lawsuit. The nursing homes cited in the lawsuit had not had an inspection in years, some as far back as 2020, according to the suit filed last year.
SB376 was amended throughout session, and Greenberg and Hartung would have preferred the original version of the bill, which would have allowed counties to sign a memorandum of understanding with the health department to take over on inspections for nursing homes, freeing up state resources to work on the remaining backlog.
The initial version of the bill was based on a previous agreement between Montgomery County and the state that expired in 2021, which allowed the county to keep up with timely inspections. The original language in SB376 would have allowed other counties to request the chance to do the same.
The department opposed that version of the bill, saying it would actually cost the state more money to let counties conduct inspections and would create other complications. Supporters of the legislation disagreed, but the bill went through a series of amendments before it was struck out during conference committee and rewritten to the new reporting requirements.
“When you can’t get the inspections done, what are your alternatives?” Hartung said. “It [reporting requirements] is a step forward … But we know that they’re not getting done, so the question is what kind of teeth will there be in that reporting?”
But both Hartung and Greenberg still believe that the new reporting requirements will help keep tabs on the department as it works through the backlog of nursing home inspections.
“We obviously need that reporting,” Greenberg said. “I’m sure that some of those reports will be responses to complaints that have been alleged … There’s a lack of accountability without these reports that could lead to increased risks of neglect and abuse and most importantly, substandard care.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_581812902-1024x622.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe Public Schools)As New Mexico schools continue to grapple with more than 700 teacher vacancies, according to the most recent data, some districts have begun to rely on teachers licensed through the state’s alternative licensing programs, which provide licensure pathways for people with degrees in areas outside of education.
For instance, Hatch Valley Public Schools Superintendent Michael Chavez told Source NM about one third of the teachers the district employs are non-traditional teachers and because of this, the district does not deal with teacher vacancies to the same extent as other districts.
According to the 2024 New Mexico Educator Vacancy Report released in October, there were 737 teacher vacancies last year, 34% of which were special education teacher positions and 24% were elementary positions. The vacancy rate showed a slight improvement over 2023 by 14 positions.
When asked for the total number of current teachers licensed through an alternative program, a Public Education Department spokesperson pointed to the same report, which noted that more than 1,100 students completed a teacher preparation program at a New Mexico school last year and more than half of those students were enrolled in an alternative program.
These teachers are “highly qualified” and bring years of professional experience in their field to the classroom, Chavez said. However, he noted, they are still learning how to be teachers. This is why professional work hours are so important, for teachers from all pathways and experience. 
“One of the things that I’ve been really pushing on since we came out of COVID is we need to build the capacity of our teachers,” Chavez said. But finding the time with 180 days of instruction — a number set by the state Public Education Department in a March 2024 rule and currently in litigation — is challenging, he said. “What we need is more time…for professional development with teachers so we can develop them and build their capacity in learning how to become an effective teacher.”
New Mexico’s current Public School Code allows middle and high school teachers to use 30 hours of instructional time for parent-teacher meetings, professional development and mentorship, while elementary teachers can use up to 60 hours. These standards were established in 2023 through House Bill 130, which also set a required 1,140 instructional hours per school year. The maximum professional work hours allowed previously were even fewer.
When the Public Education Department subsequently created its rule requiring 180 instructional days per calendar year, it also included a stipulation that professional work hours be completed before school, after school or on a day outside of the required minimum, so as to not detract from students’ instructional time. 
That component of the rule also faces opposition.
Whitney Holland, president of American Federation of Teachers’ New Mexico chapter, told Source NM that there are “more than enough opportunities to accommodate” professional development during regular school time and that her organization is “going to hold the line” against the PED’s rule.
Holland told Source that AFT-NM always advocates for more professional development time and an alignment between primary and secondary teachers’ allowed hours.
“I think the most valuable time I had as professional development as a teacher was that time where I could collaborate with my peers and even go into their classrooms and see what they’re doing,” Holland said. 
She said she has some concern over alternative licensed teachers filling so many teacher vacancies because teaching is often their second career and AFT wants to make sure “we’re investing in people who are going to stay in their communities and stay in their field,” but “at the end of the day, I’ve worked with a ton of [alternative] licensed teachers who have been super capable. They bring a lot to the table.”
Holland said she would rather have alternative licensed teachers fill vacancies than long-term substitutes, so long as there are “some” individuals in classrooms with traditional licensure through the PED.
House Bill 238, introduced during this year’s legislative session, would have amended the Public School Code to allow all levels of teachers K-12 up to 60 hours of professional work hours. The House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, but it eventually died in the Senate Finance Committee.
Holland said she will continue advocating for teachers to have more professional work hours going forward because “we are looking at a holistic model of what pieces of education need to change and I think looking at that traditional school year, school day is part of that,” she said. “It’s not going to be one fix. It’s going to have to be a whole bunch of different things.”

Garrett sponsored last year's CHOOSE Act, which gives families tax credits of $7,000 for each eligible child to be spent on nonpublic education. Orr recently increased funding for the program in the 2026 budget. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Our leaders call Alabama’s effective voucher program the CHOOSE Act. There’s some grim irony in that.
Of course, you can choose to pay for private school tuition, whatever your reasons may be.
But it’s not my choice. Or what the families of 730,000 Alabama students want. We pay taxes to support the teachers educating our children in public schools. And we want teachers and staff to have the resources they need to help students thrive.
Yet our leaders plan to divert that money from classrooms into the pockets of wealthy families, in the form of $7,000 tax breaks. More if they have more than one kid enrolled in a private school.
Yes, yes. Under this law, the credit could cover something besides a non-public academy. But considering that two-thirds of the initial applicants to the program are already in private school or homeschooled, it’s not hard to predict how the program will operate.
You might also note current eligibility is limited to those making 300% of the poverty level. That sounds a lot more restrictive than it is.
The cap is almost $80,000 a year for a family of three and around $96,000 for a family of four. Alabama’s median household income is $62,212 a year. So we’re already letting those making more than half the households in the state into the program.
That mild regulation goes away in 2027. Which means the 1% will get in. And that you will be paying private school tuition for people who don’t need the help.
That’s not how one sells a voucher program. Instead, you preach “choice” to families and educators locked in a public education system built on discrimination.
“The CHOOSE Act will provide an opportunity for students to learn and thrive in an environment that best meets their needs, which could be a public school,” said Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the sponsor of the law, during House debate last year.
Even U.S. Sen. Katie Britt gets into it, claiming that her own federal version of this is OK because “your zip code shouldn’t determine your opportunities.”
Nor should dead racists, the main reason why some zip codes have a lot more opportunity than others. But even if we accept Garrett and Britt’s premises, the CHOOSE Act isn’t going to help poor kids. Seven thousand dollars won’t get a student struggling with poverty to a private school. Not when the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,298 a year.
One gets an image of a person in an Armani suit walking into a cell block and proclaiming freedom to the inmates while holding a $7,000 check in one hand and a $8,298 key in the other.
Freeing our schools from the prison of Jim Crow means trusting local communities with school funding; ending tax breaks to elite Alabamians that drain public services and spending money on students.
The CHOOSE Act sort of acknowledges that. Implicit in the law is the premise that any private school in Alabama is superior to any public school.
Why?
Because many private schools invest far more money in their students than the $13,461 per pupil our state does, a number that would be even lower without the 18% the federal government kicks in. Altamont in Birmingham charges over $30,000 a year for high school. Montgomery Academy asks for $19,000 for students in grades 10-12.
Just think what we could achieve if Alabama spent $30,000 a year on a public school student. Or $24,000, which gets Massachusetts nation-leading results on standardized tests. Or $17,277, the average per-pupil spending in the United States.
The CHOOSE Act has to nod at the fact that school spending works. But it also operates within the worldview of a state government that promotes private privilege over public welfare. Money can only go to people who already have it. Not the undeserving poor.
And a lot of that money is about to head out the door. The 2026 education budget originally included $100 million to fund the CHOOSE Act. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the chair of the Senate’s education budget committee, increased that to $135 million due to “overwhelming, large applicant numbers” for the program.
Expect that number to grow even more as the caps come off the program. Public school funding will suffer. Arizona in 2022 expanded an existing voucher program along the lines of what Alabama has just implemented. It proved far more expensive than they anticipated, and it’s contributed to budget problems in the state. That could happen here, and public school students will pay the price.
The key to public school improvement is obvious: collecting more taxes from the wealthy — who pay less to the state government in percentage terms than the poorest 20% — and investing them in public education. Making the system better for everyone.
But Alabama legislators have signaled they’d much rather assist children who don’t need the help.
The rest of us have no choice in that.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee approved legislation earlier this month that would allow women who are pregnant to delay the start of their incarceration for several weeks after giving birth.
HB 138, sponsored by Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, allows women booked into jail to take a pregnancy test, be given bond and released from pretrial confinement, and places them on supervised probation for up to 12 weeks after giving birth before they begin serving their prison sentence.
The judge will determine if the person is eligible to be released if she poses a danger to herself or to the community.

“With the Women’s CARE Act, we focus on providing appropriate care for those who are pregnant at the time of arrest or detention, emphasizing the deferment of time served rather than complete exemption from sentencing,” Hollis told members of the House Judiciary Committee during its April 9 meeting.
Hollis introduced nearly identical legislation in 2024 and managed to get it approved in the House Judiciary Committee with roughly the same number of days left in the session as this year. However, it failed to get consideration on the House floor.
The bill states that a woman who is pregnant or thinks she is pregnant will have the option of taking a pregnancy test. If a woman is pregnant, the test result will be reported to the court and the county health department.
She will then be released on bail during the court proceedings. If the court sentences her to be incarcerated, she will then be sentenced to supervised probation up to12 weeks after she gives birth to the child, with the time she served while on probation getting credited toward her sentence.
Any fines, fees and restitution she owes will be suspended while she is serving pre-incarceration probation.
After that time, the individual will surrender to the Alabama Department of Corrections, the county or municipal jail, or be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
A woman must report the loss of a pregnancy to the court within 72 hours while she is serving probation prior to getting incarcerated, and the court will determine when she begins her incarceration.
“I have spoken with many women who have experienced this nightmare, and did not get the proper medical attention that they should get,” Hollis said.

(Photo: Getty Images)Every time I go to work, I carry a radio, a rulebook, and the weight of knowing one mistake could cost someone their life. After more than 20 years working as a conductor for Union Pacific Railroad, I’ve learned this job isn’t just about moving freight. It’s about coming home safe and making sure everyone else does, too. That’s why I support Assembly Bill 446. 
This bill isn’t an overreach. It’s not some abstract regulation dreamed up in a government office. It’s a reflection of what rail workers see and face every single day: blocked crossings that delay ambulances and fire crews, pitch-black yards where visibility is next to nothing, and trains so long they take twenty minutes to clear an intersection—if they clear it at all. These aren’t rare occurrences. This is daily life on the railroad. And it shouldn’t take a tragedy to decide it’s time to do better. 
Assembly Bill 446 is a common-sense proposal rooted in firsthand experience. It puts basic safeguards in place, like requiring proper lighting in rail yards so workers aren’t fumbling in the dark with heavy equipment. It sets standards to prevent multiple mile-long trains from cutting off emergency services and splitting communities for hours. It addresses safety concerns with defect detectors, the trackside devices that flag potential failures, by ensuring their data isn’t kept hidden when something goes wrong. And it provides oversight over contract carriers who move rail crews to and from trains, because those folks deserve to get home safe too. 
Critics will say this bill is unnecessary. That the railroads already follow federal rules and can police themselves. But ask the workers on the ground. Ask the folks in Caliente, Carlin, or Sparks who’ve watched crossings stay blocked while help sits on the wrong side of the tracks. Congressman Mark Amodei, a Republican, recently raised concerns about these very issues in his own district. This isn’t a union-versus-corporation fight. It’s about public safety, and it affects us all. 
We’ve seen what happens when railroads are left to set their own limits. In the past decade, the major carriers have pushed longer and heavier trains onto the rails under a model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It was designed not for safety or efficiency but for Wall Street. The result? Skeleton crews, overloaded trains, and delayed response times when emergencies strike. Safety has become a cost to cut, not a value to protect. 
No one is saying railroads aren’t vital. They are. They move goods across this country every day and are the backbone of our economy. But with that responsibility comes the obligation to do it safely and to serve the communities they run through. Not just the shareholders they report to. 
Some lobbyists will argue that state laws like AB 446 interfere with federal regulation. What they don’t say is that many of these same companies have spent years lobbying against national safety standards. They’ve defeated efforts to regulate train length, mandate two-person crews, or require timely data sharing on safety devices. And now, when states like Nevada step up to fill the gap, they cry foul.
If we wait for Washington to solve this, we’ll be waiting a long time. States have every right, and I would argue a duty, to protect their citizens when federal action falls short. AB 446 doesn’t replace federal law. It complements it by addressing the unique challenges our state faces, from remote rural towns to rapidly growing urban areas. 
In the railroad industry, we often say that safety is no accident. But it can’t just be a slogan. It has to be a commitment backed by policy, training, investment, and yes, regulation. Because when things go wrong on the railroad, they go wrong fast and with consequences that ripple far beyond the tracks. 
I don’t write this as a politician or a lobbyist. I write it as someone who’s walked the ballast in extreme weather conditions. As someone who’s crawled under rail cars in the dead of night. And as someone who’s had to explain to new hires that they’ll be riding in clunky passenger 
vans on icy roads for 12 hours, because there’s no law saying their safety has to be taken seriously. 
AB 446 is a step toward changing that. It says we see you, we hear you, and we’re going to do better. For the workers, yes. But also for the parents stuck behind blocked crossings, for the paramedics trying to save a life, and for the next generation who deserves to grow up in a state where safety isn’t optional. 
It’s not radical. It’s responsible. And it’s long overdue. 
At the end of the day, this bill isn’t just about trains. It’s about people.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/railroad-sign-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).In what many are calling an astonishing dereliction of duty, the Maryland Senate’s Judicial Proceeding Committee (JPR) failed to move “Good-Cause” eviction legislation forward. Despite unprecedented statewide support, including a 96-37 vote in the House last year, JPR allowed amendments pushed by the landlord/developer (LL/D) industry tying the legislation to rent stabilization laws, and weakening good-cause standards, letting landlords arbitrarily and unjustly evict renters from their homes.
The committee’s first amendment would have required rent stabilization programs across Maryland to drop vacancy control from apartment homes. Vacancy control maintains rent levels for apartments when a tenant moves out. Vacancy decontrol lets rent float up to market rates, often to levels new tenants cannot afford. Affordable housing advocates adamantly oppose decontrol, pointing to the further loss of reasonably priced housing stocks.
The second series of amendments would have knocked the teeth out of the good causes that would be required to justify nonrenewal of leases and the eventual eviction of a tenant who stays longer than the lease term, known as Tenant Holding Over (THO). Including minor violations of a lease or community rules, for example, as a justification to evict turns on its head the very principle of establishing a stated, substantial violation to justify forcing someone from their home.

Consensus has been building for decades that stable, quality homes are central determinants of community health, welfare and prosperity. The idea that a rental apartment is a mere “unit” no different than any commodity, like craft beer or concert tickets, has faded as the relationship of stable, quality housing to social welfare and prosperity has changed.
Nearly 40% of Maryland residents now live in rental housing not as a station on the way to owning, but as permanent housing. It is no longer acceptable to destabilize whole communities with unpredictable and excessive rent increases that rely entirely on market potential, or to evict without good reason, without considering the social and economic costs to tenants and our communities.
At least that’s what we thought …
But alongside modern thinking on housing policy that promotes affordability, and legislation to ensure stability, a counter narrative promoted by the rental housing industry and its well-financed network of lobbyists and bloggers has spawned, citing cherry-picked and distorted data.
The narrative goes like this: Things like good-cause protections, rent stabilization or stronger code and rights enforcement might sound nice to uneducated renters and their advocates, but they don’t really need them. What they really need is investment in building more housing so that market competition will eliminate the lack of affordability and disincentivize bad landlord behavior.
They define the housing crisis solely as a “shortage,” citing market demand for housing while ignoring the instability of existing residents’ housing, and conveniently omitting discussion around when or how that demand might be met in specific markets. They say all we need to do is “build our way out of the crisis.”
Industry-friendly bloggers cite the building boom of the Sun Belt and how housing prices there have come down, not mentioning high vacancy rates and low demand in some of those cities. They cite the St. Paul, Minnesota, sample where new multifamily building slowed after rent stabilization passed — but fail to mention how, when the city went back and exempted new development long enough for investors to recoup their investment and make a profit, investment in multifamily housing continued at its hurried pace.
Closer to home, the LL/D bloggers cite the lack of building in Takoma Park, citing rent stabilization as the cause.  They don’t mention the lack of land availability in Takoma Park, now understood to be a built-out community.
Housing codes and renter protections were introduced decades ago to put an end to the squalor, instability and abuse past generations of tenants endured. Teachers, police, nurses, retail workers, immigrants, young families and now, an increasing number of senior citizens are no longer able to purchase a home in a housing market that places home ownership well out of their reach.
Marylanders must ask why Senate Judicial Proceedings Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) would give deference to these fallacious industry narratives that set up a false choice between renter protections and building more housing, rather than using every tool at their disposal to get this done for constituents demanding action — and facts.
More than 5,000 Marylanders were evicted last year for THO, likely a tip-of-the-iceberg figure as it does not count those who move before going to court. Until our elected officials press them on just what that means, we will continue to see whole renter communities destabilized, while anger grows at those elected to represent them who failed to act.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb18_renterrally_goodcause-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of CT families. Here's what to know.,"Gov. Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of Connecticut families. The plan is one of several bills that lawmakers are considering to improve access to early childhood education.
The issue has a lot of support from lawmakers, parents, advocates and members of the business community. That’s in part because the COVID-19 pandemic brought the urgent need for child care into focus for many, including Lamont, and became the catalyst for him to create a Blue Ribbon Panel to study the issue. But paying for more families to access child care spots and improving salaries for workers in the sector is an expensive proposition.
Here’s what to know. 
Would my family qualify for pre-K under the governor’s plan? 
It depends on your household income. Families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for pre-K. Families making up to $150,000 a year would pay just $20 a day. But households earning more than $150,000 a year would still pay out of pocket for pre-K, unless they have access to schools in a district that offers spots, like New Haven and Hartford. 
What would the governor’s plan do for infant and toddler care? 
Currently, the governor’s plan does not cover infant and toddler care, only children ages 3 to 5. While advocates say infant and toddler care is critically important for Connecticut families, especially to help companies fill more than 90,000 vacancies across the state, many still support Lamont’s plan because they say it represents a major step in the right direction.
Plus, advocates say, Lamont’s plan would maintain the integrity of the infant and toddler system that currently exists by improving salaries for workers in child care centers while building capacity and spots in public schools.
How would I enroll my children in pre-K under Lamont’s plan?
Lawmakers envision a new portal that would provide easily accessible information for parents to quickly see all of the pre-K options available to them. There are currently bills under consideration that propose this solution, including House Bill 5003, a more comprehensive plan to support early childhood care, and House Bill 7044, which focuses on the creation of the online portal.
When would these additional pre-K slots be available?
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye says that a significant number of new subsidized pre-K spots would be added by 2028 and that by 2032 the vast majority of Connecticut’s pre-K population would have access. Those spots would be spread across child care centers, public schools, group child care homes and family child care homes.
How would Connecticut pay for all these new spots? 
Under Lamont’s plan, up to $300 million in surplus funds would be directed to a Universal Preschool Endowment Fund. Of that, $30 million could be spent in the next fiscal year, with 10% of the endowment eligible for spending each year thereafter. In his budget address, Lamont optimistically told lawmakers, “our budget anticipates almost $1 billion in the endowment over the next few years — God, the economy, and President Trump willing.” 
What other plans are on the table? 
Lawmakers are also considering other plans for pre-K.  Senate Bill 1 would involve a four phase approach that would eventually build toward covering not only pre-K but infant and toddler care as well, and similar to Lamont’s proposal, it would rely on surplus funds. The first phase of that proposal would call for a “tri-share” model in which businesses would be asked to contribute to the cost of child care for their employees, but participation would be voluntary. Another plan, House Bill 5003, seeks to allow more households to qualify for Care4Kids, would expand the child care subsidy fund, provide support to child care workers and help with renovations to child care facilities. And Senate Bill 1369 would provide financial assistance for working families to pay for child care through a new 1.5% payroll tax on large, for-profit employers.
Why has this issue become a priority? 
During the COVID pandemic, the issue of access to affordable, quality child care came to the forefront. Suddenly, medical workers and other essential workers across Connecticut were left without child care. Advocate Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman said COVID “created a dystopian reality” where workers were quitting left and right because child care was simply unavailable and the necessity of child care to the survival of the workforce was suddenly glaring.
In 2023, Lamont created a Blue Ribbon Panel to study child care. The bill being considered by lawmakers is a result of the panel’s report, which found that the sector was struggling with many problems simultaneously, from low-wages for child care workers and pre-K teachers, to the lack of transportation in some rural regions, to limited hours in public school programs that made it impossible for parents to work and make pick-ups and drop-offs. The governor’s plan intends to address all of these issues.
With so many federal cuts, will there really be enough money in the state budget? 
That question can’t really be answered yet. With significant federal cuts to all kinds of programs, from libraries and museums to support services for the unhoused, to threats to Medicaid and Medicare, it’ stands to reason’s possible that the kinds of surpluses envisioned when the plan was drafted may not be available.
It’s notable that Lamont has stood by the plan despite all of the upheaval in recent months. Asked at The Connecticut Mirror’s In the Room event, featuring a sit-down interview with the governor on March 26, about what problem he would fix in the state if he could fix anything, Lamont brought up education, specifically early childhood. Like paying down the pension deficit, Lamont framed the issue as a key part of the legacy he might leave behind.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor’s Office)Attorneys representing a group of New Jersey parents and activist groups are asking a state appellate court to weigh in on a case that could reshape the state’s public education system.
At the center of the fight is whether New Jersey schools are unconstitutionally segregated by race and socioeconomic status. A lower court judge in October 2023 acknowledged the state’s public schools are segregated by race and that the state must act, but also found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the entire system is segregated across all its districts.
The parents’ attorneys filed a motion last week with the state’s appellate division asking it to hear the case.
“It is imperative that no more students be deprived of these rights by the trial court’s avoidance of the straightforward conclusion compelled by the facts and the law in this case — that the state defendants, who are legally obligated to take action to desegregate public schools regardless of the reasons for that segregation, have acted unconstitutionally by failing to do so,” the attorneys wrote in the filing.
Gov. Phil Murphy and the state Department of Education have until April 28 to respond to the plaintiffs’ new filing. A spokesman for the Murphy administration declined to comment. 
News of the new filing was first reported by Chalkbeat Newark.
The case dates to 2018, when the Latino Action Network, the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, and several other families and groups sued the state alleging New Jersey failed to address de facto segregation in public schools. The plaintiffs cited data showing that nearly half of all Black and Latino students in New Jersey attend schools that are more than 90% non-white, in districts that are often just blocks from predominantly white districts. 
In New Jersey, students typically attend schools in the municipality where they live. Plaintiffs argued that long-standing housing policies that led to segregated residential neighborhoods led to segregated schools also. New Jersey is the seventh-most segregated state for Black and Latino students, the plaintiffs say.
In October 2023, after Superior Court Judge Robert Lougy issued his ruling that acknowledged racial segregation in New Jersey schools but said it was not widespread, both sides entered mediation talks in hopes it would resolve more quickly than continued litigation.
Attorneys for the parties said in February that it’s unlikely continuing the talks would “be constructive.”
The plaintiffs’ attorneys say the lower court’s October ruling should be reversed. They want a judge to review what they say are six errors in the 2023 order, like the fact that Lougy did not identify a disputed fact. 
“Rather than reach the only logical conclusion that followed — that the state defendants violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights — the trial court left the question of liability for another day,” the filing reads.
If the appellate court denies the motion, the case would return to the trial court, or could be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Cuts to U.S. Department of Agriculture food assistance programs could hit local farmers, food banks and their users at a time when more families are reliant on them.
Northwest Harvest CEO Thomas Reynolds has been tracking the situation closely.
Northwest Harvest is a statewide nonprofit that distributes goods to most food banks in Yakima County, and has 400 partners across the state. Since 2023, it has operated the Fruitvale Community Market in Yakima, a food pantry modeled after a grocery store and one of the largest food banks in the state.
Lately, the lines at Fruitvale Community Market have been much longer than usual, Reynolds told the Yakima Herald-Republic. The food bank is open three days a week. Last summer, it served about 750 households on the days it was open, a number that’s now grown to 1,300 households.
“That’s a really strong indicator that household budgets are being constrained by the increased cost of rent, of fuel, of food and of health care,” Reynolds said.
The federal funding situation is changing each day, he said.
“It’s just a dynamic situation right now,” Reynolds said. He does not believe a complete federal cut would happen, as too many constituents rely on these programs.
If there was a complete cut, “every food bank overnight would have to quadruple what they’re doing just to meet the gap,” he said.
Reynolds said Northwest Harvest is preparing for a wide range of scenarios. While the organization does not rely on federal funding to operate, many of its partners do. Northwest Harvest depends on donations of money and food, and has some state support.
 Farmers and harvest

Adding to the situation, and his worries, are concerns about potential labor shortages during the upcoming harvest season and tariffs impacting farmers’ bottom line, which might lower produce donations to Northwest Harvest.
Northwest Harvest has increased its budget for purchasing food in case less food is donated, he said.
“The growers, the orchardists, the ranchers in the Yakima Valley are some of the most generous people in Washington state,” Reynolds said.
About 70% of the foods the organization distributes across the state are fruits and vegetables, most of which are grown near Yakima, he said. It also receives local beef, dairy, eggs and will trade some of its apples for other in-demand goods it can’t get locally, like citrus fruit.
He’s also concerned about how the terminations of USDA research positions might impact the future of American agriculture.
 Senator’s perspective

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat who represents Washington state, lambasted the Trump administration for funding cuts in a news conference on April 10. She said $1.6 billion in funds that help food banks, public school students and local farmers have been cut nationwide.
The USDA’s Local Food for Schools program awards funds to schools to buy local produce; the Local Food Purchase Assistance program helps states, tribes and territories buy local food for food banks; and the Emergency Food Assistance Program provides food assistance to people with low incomes.
All are facing cuts. Around $25 million would have gone to Washington state alone, she said.
“Right now, some of the richest and most powerful men in the world are stealing food from our kids,” Murray said.
Joining Murray was Cal Coblentz, CEO of Partners Inland Northwest, a food bank in Spokane. Coblentz said that at least a quarter of households in Washington need some kind of food assistance, according to studies by the state Department of Agriculture.
That increased from just one in seven in 2021, he said. In some areas, up to 70% of households with children might need food assistance.
So far, 23 school districts have withdrawn from the Local Food from Schools program because they don’t have money in their budgets to make up for the federal funding shortfall, according to Murray’s office. The program helps get fresh food to around 850,000 students in Washington state, the senator said.
 On the farm

The Local Food Purchase Assistance program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program also saw cuts of $500 million each nationwide, she said. USDA Farm to School grants also were canceled, which help food purchasing programs as well as field trips and school gardens.
“These programs support American farmers by buying their products,” Murray said.
Cutting the programs hurt the domestic market at a time when the international market is in flux with proposed tariffs, she said.
“It’s almost as if their plan is to hammer farmers as hard as they can,” Murray said.
Haley Olsen-Wailand, a farmer who grows organic vegetables on the Olympic Peninsula, said last year was the best year financially in her family’s 22 years of growing. But now, she has major concerns about the future with the federal cuts.
She said just under 20% of her farm’s gross sales came from sales to food banks, spurred directly by Local Food Purchase Assistance program funds, she said.
A grocery store might not want curved cucumbers, but food banks will buy them.
“As a farmer, having a market for secondary vegetables and fruits is very valuable,” she said.
Local schools were starting to make more meals from scratch using local produce because of the programs.
“We were excited by the idea that we had an expanding local market,” she said. “In our industry, new markets are few and far between.”
Now she’s not as confident.
“We put these seeds in the ground, and it’s months before we harvest them. We need to know where they are going, she said. “Losing these markets is a really big blow to us right as our costs are rising.”

Indiana has 140 certified problem-solving courts across 61 counties, operated by 94 judges working alongside prosecutors, attorneys, case managers, and service providers. These courts tackle the underlying causes of criminal behavior — including substance abuse, mental health struggles, and family instability — through a rigorous, evidence-based approach.
Participants commit to intensive services, frequent court appearances, weekly meetings, and drug screenings. Our problem-solving courts are not a shortcut to leniency; they demand accountability and sustained effort. Indeed, success is neither easy nor guaranteed, and graduation can take years. But when participants reach that milestone, the sense of accomplishment and hope is profound. Having attended many problem-solving court graduations myself, I assure you that the overwhelming joy and aspiration is indescribable.
And the effectiveness of these courts is well documented. A 2023 independent study by Temple University found that 93% of our problem-solving court graduates were not rearrested. With more than 250,000 new criminal cases filed in Indiana each year, we count on our judges to make firm, fair sentencing decisions to protect public safety while honoring the constitutional mandate of reform. In 1816, our founders made it clear through the Indiana Constitution — now embedded in Article 1, Section 18 — that our state’s criminal justice system promises reformation, not vindictive justice.
Problem-solving courts embody this principle, offering a structured path to lasting change.
Chief Justice Rush highlights ways judicial system is working to improve the lives of Hoosiers

Nationally, the criminal justice system has become a primary source of referrals to treatment. Our problem-solving courts offer a proven path to rehabilitation. The Indiana Supreme Court’s Office of Court Services certifies these courts to ensure that they comply with all applicable court, state, and federal regulations.
They are designed to help veterans get stable housing, a person in recovery to get job training, and parents to catch up on child support. And success for problem-court participants includes life-changing accomplishments, such as marking sobriety, reconnecting with family, earning a diploma, getting a driver’s license, depositing a hard-earned paycheck, or moving into a new home.
These are the types of triumphs that can cause a ripple effect for an entire community.
The state has limited resources, so it is unquestionably wise to use them in areas that have demonstrated long-term value to our communities. Investing in problem-solving courts is about allocating resources efficiently and effectively. And the results speak for themselves.
Our problem-solving court data shows thousands of graduates and hundreds of thousands of negative drug screens. But the real return on investment is not a number, and it is not quantifiable with a metric—it is the countless lives reclaimed.
Indiana’s problem-solving courts exemplify all that is good in our judicial system; justice tempered with mercy and based on principles of reformation required by the Indiana Constitution. They improve individual outcomes, provide a pathway for children to be safely reunited with their parents, and contribute to safer communities.
So, as you celebrate events this spring, consider attending a problem-solving court graduation in your community. Witness firsthand the transformation, the perseverance, and the second chances these courts provide. If your community doesn’t have a problem-solving court now, they hopefully will soon, as nearly 20 are in the planning stages.
And as we continue to expand these courts, more Hoosiers will have the opportunity to turn their lives around — one joyful milestone at a time.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers have just a week to close a staggering $2 billion hole in the state’s next two-year spending plan — plus, bridge disagreements over publicly funded vouchers to private schools, regulations on marijuana-like products and school board elections.
The General Assembly aims to finish its work this week, but technically has until a statutory April 29 deadline to wrap up.
“Our job, one more important than any other legislation that we pass, is to make sure we pass a budget that is balanced and done so with integrity and not gimmicks,” Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray told reporters Thursday. “So, it’s going to be hard to do now, but we’re going to get it done.”
The budget, contained in House Bill 1001, is typically the last to cross the legislative finish line. But a crushing revenue forecast last week complicated an already formidable task.
The anticipated shortfall creates a “major” challenge, Bray said, and puts “everything” on the table when it comes to cuts and revenue generators. 
“They’re working through the line items. I think the thing that we want to protect and hold to the longest is trying to protect K-12,” House Speaker Todd Huston told reporters.

Both GOP leaders acknowledged that’ll be a challenge. K-12 is 47% of the budget.
Asked how he’d justify a universal expansion of a “school choice” voucher program amid cuts, Huston replied, “I can justify that we fund students in the state of Indiana. We don’t fund systems. So that’s the way our caucus has always approached it.” 
The voucher expansion would allow wealthy Hoosiers of all income levels to send their children to private school on a state-paid voucher. Right now the cap is 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the federal free or reduced price lunch program, equal to about $220,000.
House Republicans put the expansion into their version of the budget, but the Senate GOP stripped it out even before the rough financial news. Democrats in both chambers have long decried the spending of taxpayer dollars on private schooling.
“They’re very important to some people in our caucus, the House as well,” Bray acknowledged. “And so, the idea of having vouchers is certainly a viable option, but we’re going to have to figure out how to pay for it if that’s the case.”
  House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta answers reporter questions on Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Skipping the expansion is among Democrats’ first choices for cuts.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta assailed the voucher program as “irresponsible spending,” adding, “I mean, we’re almost approaching, now, a billion dollars there.”
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder also suggested holding off on scheduled income tax cuts, which Bray said was “certainly … on the table.”
But cutting expenses isn’t the only way to plug the anticipated hole in state finances.
Cigarette tax hikes and more under consideration
Indiana’s sobering fiscal outlook may soften the Senate’s traditionally hostile stance against a long-sought increase in the cigarette tax. But is it enough?
The current rate of 99.5 cents per pack has gone unchanged since 2007. A $2 increase could bring in $318 million in new revenue annually, and bring down the state’s high smoking rate.
“Our caucus was slightly more amenable to that than they have been in the past, primarily because of the challenge that Medicaid has created for us,” Bray said.
The House has voted to approve cigarette tax hikes multiple times but Bray indicated his caucus’ resistance hasn’t totally waned.
“That’s still on the table, but it’s not at all going to be the first thing we look at,” he said.
Yoder, his Democratic counterpart, additionally suggested pursuing a managed care assessment fee. If fully implemented, the fee could bring the state $1 billion a year.
“We should be doing this (to) our managed care entities, the insurance companies who are making money off of our Pathways (to Aging program) patients,” she said. “We should be looking there.”
But it would require federal approval. Mitch Roob, who helms the agency overseeing Indiana’s Medicaid program, has expressed doubt that President Donald Trump’s administration would allow the Hoosier state to max it out.

And despite repeated assurances from leaders that “everything is on the table,” Huston was clear that one thing isn’t: marijuana legalization.
“We’re not going to legalize marijuana in the budget,” he said. He similarly batted away questions about gambling industry expansions.
“Significant public policy things shouldn’t be considered just because you have a revenue shortfall,” Huston told reporters.
Democrats, however, maintain conditions are ripe for a “serious conversation” about the drug.
Regulations for already-available, marijuana-like substances — and an accompanying excise tax — are still up for consideration, but face an uncertain path amid plenty of Senate skepticism.
Marijuana-lite tax could boost revenue, if lawmakers let it
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Past attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly. 
Senate Bill 478 is the furthest lawmakers have gotten. But it needs to survive closed-door negotiations — despite its sponsor’s attempts to avoid them — before it can cross Braun’s desk.
The measure would task the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission with overseeing the industry, including approving up to 20,000 retail permits. It sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements over the currently unregulated substances; an excise tax was removed because new taxes must go into House-originated legislation.
The revenue-generating provision is expected to find a new home.
 
Medicaid is expected to be about 20% of the budget. Because it’s an entitlement program — in which anyone who meets eligibility requirements has the right to enroll — states have limited power to cut costs.


“If it works its way through the process, I do think there’ll be an excise tax on it,” Huston told reporters. He was optimistic, citing “robust discussion” across three House committee hearings.
“There’s (been) a lot of discussion about where we are on the legalization, or, excuse me, the regulation of those products,” he concluded.
His Senate counterpart was more skeptical.
“We’re not gonna do a delta-8 bill to chase revenue. At all. That’s not the policy that we’re trying to pursue,” Bray said. “If we can find a way forward with that bill, then we will.”
Despite a whopping seven rounds of edits, critics still say the language would expand existing loopholes and legalize overly potent drugs.
“The way that it moved out of the House is not acceptable to the Senate,” Bray said. 
Lawmakers are still working on a compromise, but commented, “I have no ability to tell you that that’ll pass the finish line.”
‘Razor-thin’ margins expected for partisan school board compromise
Disagreements between House and Senate Republicans could sink another contentious measure — years in the making — adding political party affiliations to Indiana’s currently nonpartisan school board elections.
Senate Bill 287 originally would’ve required school board candidates to run in partisan primary elections. But, last month, House lawmakers changed it. Now it carries resurrected language requiring partisan designations only on the general election ballot. 
The Senate dissented to the changes, teeing up negotiations.

“(It’s the) same idea, but fairly dramatic changes,” Bray said. “… We’ve got members that are trying to work through that, to see if they can find a path forward that both the House and Senate can accept. I don’t think they’re there yet, but they’re still working on it.”
A Thursday conference committee hearing — when lawmakers usually provide short updates on negotiations or outline their compromises — was cancelled, then rescheduled for Monday.
“We’re still in conversations on how it’s going to go,” Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, told the Capital Chronicle. He sponsored the Senate bill, and authored the dead House bill.
But, he added, “I think the final version will still look a lot like how it left the House.”
Gaining Senate support could be a challenge, however.
In its original form, the legislation squeaked through the Senate on a 26-20 vote in February. The House, which has historically been friendlier to the concept of partisan school boards, approved the overhauled version with greater leeway in a 54-40 tally last month.
Asked if he’d have enough votes, Bray replied, “You know, that’s a razor-thin margin. So I do not have the answer for your question.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level, and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– amir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields, and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says, New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is before the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Washington’s top commerce official says the state cannot shield its economy from the fallout of rapidly escalating tariffs, particularly in sectors like agriculture, aerospace and technology.
“There is no way in Washington state that we can cover the gap for a global tariff trade war,” said Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn in a wide-ranging interview on “Inside Olympia”. “We haven’t recovered from the last trade war [in 2018],” he told host Austin Jenkins, “We’re still down 30% of exports to the Asia Pacific region because of the previous ones.”
Washington is among the most trade-dependent states in the nation, with more than $58 billion in exports in 2024 and 40% of jobs tied to trade. According to the governor’s office, new and retaliatory tariffs could cost the state’s agriculture sector $7.5 billion, with significant hits expected to apples, cherries, potatoes, wheat and dairy. India, for example, has imposed a 20% retaliatory tariff on U.S. apples, which the state says has caused shipments to fall dramatically.
Nguyễn emphasized that while the state has launched a tariff information resource and is engaging international partners like Canada, Vietnam and Mexico, its capacity is limited.
“These tariffs are even worse than what we saw last time,” he said.
Nguyễn described the Department of Commerce’s role as pivotal — but constrained — in navigating such external pressures. With 485 programs and an $8 billion portfolio, the agency manages everything from housing and behavioral health to economic development and small business grants.
“If this was a publicly traded company, you’re talking about a Fortune 500 company,” he said. “It is a behemoth in terms of the reach that we have.”
Among Commerce’s most visible challenges is the state’s growing housing crisis. Washington needs more than 1.1 million additional housing units by 2040, according to state projections, with more than half required to serve the lowest-income residents. Nguyễn acknowledged that even with a proposed $600 million investment in the Housing Trust Fund — the largest in state history — gaps remain.
“It amounts to about 2% of what we actually need on an annual basis,” he said. “So we can do as much as we can at the state to enable, in this case, affordable housing … but we need the capital markets. We need other investments.”
Interest in streamlining
Nguyễn said the state’s regulatory landscape often slows or derails projects, despite good intentions behind the rules. He cited conflicting definitions between two housing bills — one related to middle housing and another to accessory dwelling units — that have created confusion among local governments trying to comply with growth management laws.
Nguyễn said he is developing a new proposal he calls a “Fast Track,” which would apply an “abundance mindset” to housing policy by targeting areas with high need and fewer regulatory hurdles. He said the idea is still in early stages and has not yet been publicly vetted. “I have a proposal that I’m shopping with the governor’s policy team right now, said Nguyễn. “The concept aims to demonstrate that faster, more affordable construction is possible under a streamlined permitting model.
“If your goal is to build more housing, [then let’s] build more housing,” he said.
Nguyễn’s critique of bureaucratic inefficiency is grounded in his personal experience. He described the difficulty of navigating complex compliance rules required to administer state and federal grants, saying the state’s administrative and accounting manual alone is 1,067 pages. When combined with federal guidance and additional rules, it can exceed 1,500 pages per program.
“That’s longer than ‘Game of Thrones’. That’s the whole of ‘Lord of the Rings’. That’s double the longest ‘Harry Potter book’,” he said. There’s at least $300,000 to $400,000 of compliance costs associated with that.”
To tackle the problem, Nguyễn spent a recent weekend building a custom GPT chatbot using publicly available data from the state accounting manual, federal compliance guidelines and program rules. He fed in sample invoices and used the tool to rate their compliance risk as high, medium or low.
“I made a custom GPT… and it came back, and it’s fairly accurate,” he said. “There are ways for us to be much more effective so that we can still be compliant, provide the tools for our staff to be much more effective with their time and our resources.”
Nguyễn said the goal isn’t to replace state workers but to free them from rote administrative tasks so they can focus on designing programs and serving communities.
“We’ve essentially built a system where you’re trying to catch 1% who might cause a problem, and you punish everybody else,” he said.

When all the damage has been done, what will be left to salvage?
Will this beautiful house that is America — albeit in need of some major home improvements — collapse or be in irreparable disrepair?
We’re all distracted by the sound of the woodpecker on the roof, chipping away at the protective covering of our democracy. But unseen within the walls, the termites are doing catastrophic and undetected damage.
What is occurring today on the state and national level at break-neck speed is unprecedented on so many levels. We often find it difficult to keep up.
America has always been fighting with itself — with words, rarely with arms. The north against the south. Urban versus rural. Whites versus Blacks. Conservative versus liberal. Left versus right.
And, of course, we have the Democrats versus the Republicans.
You get the point. Diversity, which has taken on a toxic meaning, is and has always been what defines America.
Somehow, we have continued to co-exist. Somehow, we all have remained Americans — free to believe, free to live, free to express our differences.
But, today there is a concerted effort to tear down and redesign America into something very different.
Illegal immigration has been presented as the main area needing repair. But it won’t stop there, as the major remake taking place is to remove all diversity from the foundation of America, pillar by pillar.
Other façade and structural changes are neither superficial nor temporary but substantive and permanent whether they occur with a blast or hammer. We as bystanders or recipients often do not realize that the whole house is at risk of coming down around us.
Don’t be blinded by the immigration fix. Yes, immigration needs to be overhauled, but it should be done in the right way.
More importantly, don’t ignore or dismiss other “remodeling” taking place and think of it in isolation. For example, the removal of DEI programs is more than it may first appear. The effort has morphed into attempts to completely remove the presence and contributions of Blacks and women, including throwing out books and other evidence that document the factual and official record of American history.
You may recall it began with rendering Affirmative Action illegal, under the guise and pretext of the great lie and great illusion that equal access and opportunity are available to all citizens. The pretending and propagating continue despite the obvious realities.
The termitic behavior doesn’t stop there.
Look at the attacks on public and private education. The dismantling and dissolution of the Department of Education that provides all kinds of support for K-12 is essentially bifurcating and decentralizing what defines and constitutes a quality education for our children and the nation’s future citizens, leaving it up to individual states.
Many states are already engaged in trashing and banning books that could provide our children with a real education about the facts and history of this country.
Some of the nation’s most academically rigorous colleges and universities are being targeted and financially penalized in an effort to control who can be admitted, how they operate, and how they allow freedom of expression among their students.
An ignorant populace is easier to indoctrinate and rule.
Then, there is the wanton disregard for the rule of law, due process and ruling of the courts.
No area of American life is being left untouched by these termitic efforts to devour and destroy.
There is gutting of the military not only of personnel, but of the personal achievements and contributions of women and Blacks to this country’s safety and security that have occurred across decades. This includes removing photographs and books — all in an attempt to rewrite history and control what future cadets, soldiers, shipmen, airmen who chose to serve their country believe.
Institutions, like the treasured Smithsonian, which preserve the history of our civilization for current and future generations are not spared. An edict has been issued that targets specific collections like the African American History Museum, the Women’s History Museum, and the Art History Museum.
The purpose is to rip out or whitewash any things that may not fit the new prefabricated American house being built.
When you consider the enormous damage that can be wrought as a result of a wrecking ball being swung at agencies that oversee public health, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security — services designed to not only protect the most vulnerable Americans, but all Americans, it begs the question: Why?
Don’t lose sight of the ongoing chipping away of the autonomy and independence of the press.
What is the end game?
Is it to change America into a white society controlled by autocratic oligarchs, where the middle class is controlled, the poor and disenfranchised continue to remain poor, uneducated, or undereducated and oppressed, and the wealthy continue to thrive?
Where freedom of the press and individual expression will be curtailed and suppressed.
The overriding question: Are we connecting the dots and getting the whole picture?
You do not have to read Project 2025. Just pay attention to what is being said and done before it is too late.
Take some time and ponder the question: Why?
More importantly, when all the termitic activity is done and a different America is left standing, will you, your children and future generations have a better country to call home?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WeakeningAmerica2-anotherperfectday-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-04-21 07:03:31.441955

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), an agency responsible for providing funding to states, including over $266.7 million last year. In 2024, Wisconsin received $3.23 million from the federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States program, which is the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the country. 
Northern Waters Library Services Director Katherine Elchert called IMLS the “backbone” of American libraries. While the cuts could affect all libraries, Elchert said the cut would be a “direct blow” to rural libraries, including those in her system.
Elchert’s system is one of 15 public library systems across Wisconsin. It’s made up of 27 libraries in the northern part of Wisconsin and is one of the smaller population size library systems, but the largest geographical systems. It is expected to get $64,064 in federal funding — or 8% of its total funding —  from the federal government in 2025, according to DPI. 
“Most [of my libraries] are quite small and the loss of this funding will impact every single library in my system….” Elchert said, adding that patrons might not immediately recognize the impact of cuts. “It’s not like the institute is providing money so your libraries can buy books. It’s more providing large, big picture collaborations,” she said. 
Some of those collaborative programs that could be affected include interlibrary loans, a mechanism for Wisconsin libraries to share information, books and resources across the state, WISCAT, the state’s resource sharing platform, and Badgerlink, an online library that gives people access to online databases and educational resources. 
Ben Miller, library services director for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, said his team is made up of about 20 people, 16 of them funded through federal dollars. They are responsible for providing support to local libraries, including supporting collaborative programs and ensuring they work. Miller said that Wisconsin has had more than 15 million materials moved between libraries each year with the Interlibrary Loan programs and WISCAT.
“If we lost federal funding, we would be down to a skeleton of a skeleton crew of three folks,” Miller said. 
Badgerlink is funded with state dollars, Miller said, but the staff at DPI is responsible for negotiating contracts and ensuring there is access to Wisconsin residents. 
“Our team of people make that happen, and without this federal funding, that state money would pay for content that no one can access,” Miller said. 
The agency has also worked to make WISCAT more accessible.
“We pay for the platform, we staff it… we manage it, and we have folks that help with those referrals,” Miller said. “It allows us to cast requests outside of the state even, so you could get a book from Florida into Wisconsin if that is what you need.” 
The DPI also distributes federal funds in the form of grants that allow libraries to pilot programs that could become part of regular services in the future. 
A recent example, Miller said, is the JobPod Initiative in Brown County, which has helped provide resources including digital literacy training and technology skills to Wisconsinites seeking a job through their public libraries. 
Another example of a successful program is the Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, widely known as Libby, which provides people across the state with access to e-books and audiobooks.
“We provided money, found out people loved it, slowly stepped ourselves off, and then the library systems just went nuts and started buying books and things and now we have, like, the second most checkouts in the nation in Wisconsin,” Miller said. “We were able to stand that up, using this federal money to test the concept, and say, like, ‘Hey, this thing, this works. Let’s do it,’ and then they can incorporate it into their budgets.”
Miller said that his team is looking at the potential scenarios and working to provide service until they find out they aren’t funded. 
The last time the agency got communication from the IMLS, Miller said, was after the executive order, but before the appointment of Deputy Secretary of Labor Keith E. Sonderling to serve as acting director of IMLS on March 20. 
In that communication, Miller said, the federal government notified the agency that it should expect payment on April 22. Tuesday, he said, will be the next milestone. Some states, including California and Washington state, have already received notification that their Grants to States funding has been pulled.
Wisconsin’s library agency hasn’t had any communication with the federal government lately, though it has been monitoring for anything new. Miller said the program officer assigned to Wisconsin was part of the staff put on administrative leave in March. 
Typically, Miller said, he would be preparing to finalize the budget and preparing to put out grant applications, but he said his agency will be proceeding with caution, even if the state does get the funding on Tuesday.
“We’re holding back until we have a better picture of the future… We have questions about how this will look,” Miller said. “All of this funding is contingent on the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, which comes up for renewal this October, and so even if we get this money next week, we’re going to be really gun shy about putting that out until we know the future of IMLS as an institution and Grants to States moving forward.”
Miller said that the agency is also waiting to see what comes from a multi-state lawsuit launched by 20 states, including Wisconsin, challenging the Trump administration’s cuts to the IMLS and arguing that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Elchert said the programs funded with federal money and the work of the state supporting those programs are important for broadening the collections available to libraries “particularly in those rural areas that don’t have the space or the budget to have those large collections that, say, Madison does.” 
Elchert noted that South Dakota recently announced it is suspending its interlibrary loan service in light of the federal cuts.
“My library system could not provide all of these resources. It’d be — I don’t even know how much it would cost to try and it just wouldn’t happen to be frank,” Elchert said. “So everybody is losing access to all of these larger resources that connect Wisconsin to the larger world.”
Elchert noted that the federal cuts are also affecting tribal libraries, which had their federal funds cut a couple of weeks ago. There are two, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe University Community Library and the Ben Guthrie Lac Du Flambeau Public Library, in her system.
The cuts would hit Wisconsin’s urban libraries as well.
“Ironically, this [executive order] is supposed to eliminate government inefficiency, but this is an incredibly efficient system to offer these services statewide and have them run at the state level with federal funds or any funds for that matter,” said Tana Elias, director of the Madison Public Library.
Elias said that if the funding isn’t awarded there will likely be a “scramble” in July to figure out what programs could be stopped initially and over time.
“It may be that we have to go back to the vendor and renegotiate a contract or renegotiate a reduction in service that we can afford in the meantime, while we wait for all of this to play out,” Elias said. “It’s a lot of uncertainty.”
According to a joint statement from Madison Public Library and Madison Children’s Museum, IMLS has awarded an average of 18 grants per year to Wisconsin museums, libraries and other institutions over the last 15 years — totaling nearly $70 million dollars over that span.
The Madison library was also notified that one of its recent grants that helped support the Observation Deck, a program that was being used to measure and illustrate the impact of library programming and support librarians in improving it, was canceled. She said the library had spent about half of the $240,000 awarded before it was canceled. 
“It’s a reduction,” Elias said. “But we have a plan to continue and wrap up that project with the funding that we have now.” That plan includes not moving forward with a second grant request and paying for service directly so the platform can continue to be used. “We won’t be able to expand it and offer it for other public libraries to use,” she said.
Elias added that she was concerned that the cuts could limit professional opportunities for library staff. Currently, she said many of those opportunities become available through DPI at little to no cost. She said professional training and ensuring staff have support will be even more important if public services shrink in other areas. 
“Library funding is being targeted. Humanities funding is being targeted. Arts funding is coming. We all know that education funding is being targeted as more of those funds slip away from us… as all of those safety nets shrink and fray, people will be coming to libraries more and more,” Elias said. “I think it’s even more important that we continue to have strong funding for libraries, because they’re kind of a safety net for a lot of people.” 
Elias said advocacy on behalf of libraries by Wisconsin residents and other stakeholders is essential right now. The Madison Public Library is in the process of collecting physical notes from patrons to be mailed to lawmakers. 
The Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, which includes all of the public library systems in the state, has put together a webpage to inform residents about and encourage them to lobby their lawmakers for funding.
“It does make a difference. Legislators do listen to their constituents, and I think because we are working on a statewide campaign across the whole state, we’ll hit both those Republican and Democratic legislators… I think having bipartisan support is really important,” Elias said. 
Elchert of the Northern Waters system said that librarians are “scrappy” and everyone is working to help the community.
“It’s important that patrons know that their library services will be impacted if these cuts go through,” Elchert said. “It’s not a matter of will it be felt, but how badly will it be felt.”

The Canyon County Pride president said the event was meant to be family friendly. But after an individual attending the event wore nipple pasties — despite requests from event organizers to put on a shirt — Idaho state lawmakers crafted House Bill 270 this year.
The bill updates the law to ban the public exposure of female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and products resembling genitals. Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law, and it’s effective immediately.
House Bill 270 is among several Idaho bills that received national attention for targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. Those pieces of legislation were a part of a larger effort by Idaho lawmakers to limit diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs; sex education; government display of pride flags; and medical treatment for transgender individuals — policies that reflect similar efforts by the Trump administration.
“It’s unsurprising, but it’s really disappointing that that’s how these Republican legislators are spending their time,” Wheeler told the Idaho Capital Sun. “They’re very obsessed with gay people.”
In his testimony against House Bill 270, Nikson Mathews, a trans man, said the bill would criminalize him for doing something as simple as mowing his lawn while shirtless. The Idaho transgender rights advocate said the 2025 legislative session was the “worst session” he’s experienced.

“Our community — every year, but I think this year especially — is getting smaller because there’s just so much uncertainty happening right now,” Mathews told the Sun. “It kind of feels like our futures are being stolen from us because of what is happening nationally and what is happening locally.”
He called the first pieces of legislation introduced this session — both of which targeted LGBTQ+ individuals — a “damning introduction” to the kinds of laws that would make their way through the Statehouse.
“This is our home and our community, and so we will stay as long as we possibly can,” Mathews said about himself and his partner. “But I’ll tell you, every single queer person — especially trans people in this state — we’re all planning for what is that line when we have to make a decision to leave.”

 At least 10 anti-LGBTQ+ policies were adopted in Idaho in 2025

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise said the around two dozen anti-LGBTQ+ bills considered in Idaho this year work together. 
“The cumulative effect is with the intention to erase and not recognize human beings based on who they are,” she told the Sun. “And that is the definition of discrimination. So, this Legislature has embraced formal discrimination.”
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, sponsored several of this year’s bills — but she said they aren’t connected. And she pushed back on concerns that the Legislature is making it harder for LGBTQ+ people to live in Idaho.
“Nobody’s making it harder for them to live in Idaho,” said Ehardt, a basketball coach who years earlier championed an Idaho bill that inspired other states to ban transgender kids from playing sports with students of their same gender. “They keep choosing to create and make themselves a victim. They’re not a victim. Just go to school. Be a normal school kid. Just study normal school academics.”
In addition to House Bill 270, the Idaho Capital Sun has compiled a list of legislation crafted during the 2025 legislative session that impacts LGBTQ+ individuals living in Idaho. The following bills passed largely along party lines in both legislative chambers, and were signed into law by Gov. Little:
Flags in schools
House Bill 41 prohibits public schools from displaying flags that represent political, religious or ideological views within school property. 
Sponsors: Rep. Ted Hill, R-Eagle; Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton
Status: Effective July 1 
Flags on government property
House Bill 96 restricts state and local government entities in Idaho to only display official domestic government and military flags. Schools, colleges and universities are exempt.
Sponsors: Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard; Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’ Alene
Status: In effect
Transgender bathroom, dorm ban in state facilities 
House Bill 264 directs state correctional facilities, colleges and universities and domestic violence shelters to designate multi-occupancy restrooms, changing rooms and dorm rooms “for the exclusive use by either females or males.” The bill says those facilities must only be used by “members of that sex.”
Ehardt said the bill was inspired by a national workgroup that spawned from her bill years earlier to restrict transgender students’ sports participation. 
The group, she said, included around 20 groups, including influential conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom, and an anti-trans feminist organization, the Women’s Liberation Front, also known as WoLF.
In women’s prisons, Ehardt said the WoLF group became aware that “men were starting to identify,” a trend she said started in California but has happened elsewhere.

Around 60 to 70 patients in Idaho Department of Correction custody have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, court documents released in a lawsuit last year showed. 
“If they watch what’s happening in the rest of the states, it’s only a matter before they start making their claim to be able to come to the women’s spaces,” Ehardt told the Sun.
“This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with the L, the G or the B. It only has to do with the T, and very narrowly defined,” she said.

Denying medical procedures depending on moral beliefs
House Bill 59 allows health care workers to deny participating in medical procedures that violate their religious and moral beliefs. 
Sponsors: Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene
Status: In effect
Requiring parents opt in to human sexuality education 
House Bill 239 requires parents or guardians to opt in to education on sexuality and gender identity.
The bill requires parental consent for teachings about human sexuality, incorporating an existing definition in Idaho law that includes broader sex education concepts. The law’s legal definition for abstinence includes sexual activities that can result in pregnancy, risk transmitting sexually transmitted diseases or infections; or present emotional risks. 
Ehardt said she’d been working on the bill since her first year in the Legislature. She said she pulled the human sexuality definition largely from the World Health Organization. While the definition affects LGBTQ+ sexuality teachings, she said it wasn’t targeted at that — just “all things sexual in nature.
“The sex was rampant. It could have been, you know, heterosexual sex. It could have been homosexual. It didn’t matter,” Ehardt told the Sun. “It’s not necessary. The kids don’t need to be exposed to any of that.”
This year, she said she reached out to the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal defense nonprofit based in California, for help crafting the bill’s civil cause of action. The bill allows school boards to cure potential violations before a parent can sue.

Restricting K-12 discussion on sexual orientation, gender identity
House Bill 352 directs school districts to adopt policies that ban education on “sexual orientation or gender identity” from kindergarten through 12th grade. 
Sponsors: Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood; Sen. Cindy Carlson, R-Riggins
Status: Effective July 1
Another DEI ban
Senate Bill 1198 follows years of legislative efforts to purge DEI in Idaho colleges and universities. It will ban DEI in higher ed: Hiring, employment practices, and “promoting differential treatment” or benefits to people. And it stops higher ed institutions from requiring DEI classes outside of a degree program students choose, Idaho Education News reported.

Status: Adopted by both legislative chambers, did not require the governor’s signature.
‘Traditional family values’ month 
House Concurrent Resolution 18 designates the time from Mother’s Day through Father’s Day as “Traditional Family Values Month” in Idaho. The legislation’s purpose is to “raise awareness” about the decline in “traditional families,” which according to the legislation consists of “a natural mother and father, children, grandparents, and extended family …” The resolution claims “research demonstrates children who grow up in families with traditional values and gender roles are more likely to have traditional values and gender role expectations themselves,” and says “there is an unprecedented attack on these beliefs” and their celebration.

 Anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that was introduced, but did not succeed

Other pieces of legislation that didn’t reach the governor’s desk or receive the legislative approval needed to move forward include: 
Preventing youth from attending public drag shows
House Bill 230 would have required event hosts and organizers to “take reasonable steps” to restrict minors’ access to public performances that involve “live persons engaged in sexual conduct,” if such performances are “patently offensive to an average person applying contemporary community standards in the adult community.” The bill’s statement of purpose says the legislation “uses the same indecency standard utilized by the federal government to determine whether content is appropriate for daytime television.” 
Sponsors: Rep. Ted Hill, R-Eagle; Idaho Family Policy Center, an organization that advocates for conservative Christian policies
Status: Passed Idaho House 54-11, did not receive Senate hearing.
A call to reverse same-sex marriage
House Joint Memorial 1 was addressed to the U.S. Supreme Court and pushed to restore the authority of defining marriage to the states. It asked the court to reconsider its 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S.
Sponsor: Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard
Status: Passed the Idaho House, did not receive a hearing in the Senate. 
 Stepping into direct action amid anti-LGBTQ+ Idaho policies

Despite the passage of many of these laws, LGBTQ+ advocates are planning Pride events across the Gem State later this year, including pride celebrations in Coeur d’Alene and Nampa in June, and Boise Pride in September. 
Wheeler said this year’s Canyon County Pride will be bigger than last year’s — and with more security measures. It will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. June 8 at Lakeview Park in Nampa. 
“We’ve tripled the space,” he said. “We’re tripling the six-foot privacy fencing for security purposes. Half of our budget is invested in private security and safety precautions.”
There are 70 businesses participating in the upcoming event, Wheeler said. 
“This administration and the times we are in have shown us that we really can’t rely on the institutions that we pay our tax dollars to to protect and support us,” Wheeler said. “It’s more important now than ever to just be involved in direct action. Canyon County Pride is that direct action. It’s a day to recognize how many individuals are in the community that really do exist and have these needs.”

(Getty Images)Since 2013, a Wisconsin law has blocked workers who lose a job from collecting unemployment insurance if they also receive Social Security disability benefits.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that the exclusion violates federal law. Nine months later, however, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) continues to reject unemployment claims from laid-off workers who are also on disability.
The delay in implementing the judge’s ruling frustrates workers such as Judy Fintz of La Crosse. Fintz receives a monthly Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payment of $1,400. By itself it’s not enough to live on, she says, but she’s able to work part-time at a college dining hall to help make ends meet.
When the dining hall is closed between semesters and during breaks, her income drops — but unlike other employees, she can’t file for unemployment insurance (UI) to tide her over during those periods.
“I work very hard on my job,” Fintz said in a telephone interview. “I shouldn’t have to have all this problem going on.”
The 2013 Wisconsin law that blocks SSDI recipients from collecting unemployment insurance passed the state Legislature with only Republican support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Scott Walker.
It was enacted to “prevent the payment of duplicative government benefits for the replacement of lost earnings or income, regardless of an individual’s ability to work,” in the words of the statute. A proposal in 2012 from the Walker administration claimed that most SSDI recipients didn’t work and therefore, if they collected unemployment pay, they were “double-dipping” and probably committing “fraud.”
The federal Social Security Administration program allows disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to, however. The program  encourages them to do so under procedures structured to ensure they do not lose their disability payments or their medical coverage under Medicaid.
  Victor Forberger
Victor Forberger, a Madison lawyer who represents people making unemployment insurance claims, says Wisconsin has thousands of SSDI recipients who also work part-time.
Forberger is one of a team of lawyers who sued DWD on behalf of eight plaintiffs in 2021, charging that the state ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients violated federal laws that protect people with disabilities. Lawyers from Gingras, Thomsen & Wachs and Axley Brynelson were also part of the case.
On July 17, 2024, Judge William Conley ruled on summary judgment that the 2013 law violated two federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. In his decision Conley stated that while Wisconsin law didn’t intentionally discriminate against people with disabilities, it “applies only to individuals with disabilities, meaning that it necessarily has a disparate impact on those with disabilities.”
Conley’s ruling put off a remedy for the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed as a class action, and lawyers for the plaintiffs and DWD have conflicting views about who should be included in the class action as well what remedies are appropriate. A hearing is scheduled for later this year to decide what groups of people would qualify for a remedy and what the remedies should be.
Those questions relate to people who made claims in the past however — SSDI recipients whose UI claims were denied, or whose claims were initially accepted, then reversed, and who were required to repay their unemployment compensation.
DWD has not indicated any plans to appeal the judge’s summary judgment finding.
Since the July ruling, however, DWD has continued to reject UI claims from laid-off workers who are  also on SSDI, Forberger said — ignoring Conley’s conclusion that doing so violates federal law.
“There’s no logic that I’m aware of that would indicate why a disabled worker today filing for unemployment benefits should be denied unemployment benefits,” Forberger said.
In response to an inquiry from the Wisconsin Examiner, Lee Sensenbrenner, communications director for DWD, said in an email message, “Due to the ongoing litigation here, we won’t be able to comment.”
Judy Fintz is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the SSDI restriction. She said she thought after the judge’s ruling was issued that she and other SSDI recipients would now qualify for unemployment benefits.
“If it’s discrimination — and that’s what the judge said — that’s what they should go on,” she said.
Forberger, who participated with Fintz in her telephone interview, pointed out that based on her work history and wage rate, Fintz would have a weekly unemployment insurance payment of $81.
“They’re refusing to pay her $81 a week under this eligibility ban,” he said. “Judy’s not getting rich off anything.”
Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Cliff Neuman, combines his disability payment from SSDI with part-time work he is able to take on.
Until the beginning of this year, Neuman was working part time at a grocery store. One day, he said, the store stopped scheduling him for shifts. He said he never got an explanation why.
With Forberger’s help he filed unemployment insurance claims each week for the five or six weeks he was out of work before finding a new job as a restaurant dishwasher. “A couple of times we called and people refused to help him because they said he gets SSDI and is not eligible,” Forberger said.
One requirement for UI applicants is to regularly search for new work and to document those searches. Neuman followed through on that requirement, but his UI applications got mired in rejections and appeals.
An administrative law judge found in February that Neuman was eligible, a consequence of the Conley decision in July. After a DWD lawyer asked for reconsideration, however, the administrative law judge set aside his earlier finding.
DWD’s lawyer argued that the July federal court ruling is not final and that since Conley had not issued an injunction against following the 2013 law, Conley’s decision could not be used to overrule the decision to deny Neuman’s UI claim.
Forberger submitted a response arguing that where new claims are concerned, the Conley decision should be treated as final.
The administrative law judge responded by setting aside his own earlier ruling and asking both DWD and Forberger to address additional questions.
Neuman was disappointed by that outcome and his inability to collect UI despite the Conley ruling in July.
Getting jobless pay “shouldn’t matter if I had SSDI or not,” Neuman said. “Once you’re working you should get that.”
The denial of his claims is “not right and fair,” he said. “To me that’s picking on people that have disabilities.”

But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.
“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

(Courtesy photo)Something is missing from Harrison County Hospital’s website. The homepage used to feature birth announcements with pictures, names and weights. However, the proud declarations have been taken down since the facility’s labor and delivery services closed on April 1.
Harrison County Hospital’s obstetric department is one of over a dozen that have shut down statewide since 2020, according to Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
“About 70% of these closures were in the last two years,” he said.
  Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
A March of Dimes report revealed nearly a quarter of Indiana counties are considered maternity care deserts. The growing trend is concerning because lack of access to high-quality care is a factor in maternal and infant mortality rates. 
A 2022 Indiana University Indianapolis brief showed Indiana has the third highest maternal mortality rate among reporting states at 44 deaths per 100,000 live births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked Indiana 7th in infant mortality rates by state with 7.16 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
Reasons for OB unit closures include staffing shortages, declining birth rates and low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Potential solutions involve expanding access to mobile health centers, making reimbursement rates sustainable and increasing the workforce by incorporating midwives, according to Honour Hill, director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes in Alabama.
“We know that certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives are associated with significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes, including reduced rates of preterm birth, C-sections and the like,” she said.
Why OB units are closing
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform reported more than 80 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services nationwide since 2022. Cooke said 14 OB units shut down in Indiana over the last five years:

IU Health Jay Hospital in Portland (2020)
Franciscan Health in Hammond (2021)
Pulaski Memorial Hospital in Winamac (2022)
Ascension St. Vincent Dunn Hospital in Bedford (2022) 
Parkview Wabash Hospital (2023)
St. Joseph Health Plymouth Medical Center (2023)
St. Elizabeth Dearborn Hospital in Lawrenceburg (2023)
Parkview DeKalb Hospital in Auburn (2023)
Parkview LaGrange Hospital (2023)
Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City (2023)
Parkview Whitley Hospital in Columbia City (2024) 
Bluffton Regional Medical Center (2024)
Dukes Memorial Hospital in Peru (2024)
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon (2025)

At Harrison County Hospital, the issue wasn’t fewer deliveries, according to Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber. The department performed up to 400 deliveries a year. However, both of the hospital’s OB providers left, and recruitment efforts to replace them were unsuccessful. Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager, said the decision to close the unit was not made lightly. 
  Harrison County Hospital Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber
“As Dr. [Lisa] Clunie, our CEO, often says, she was born at Harrison County Hospital. Lisa [Lieber] and I were both born at Harrison County Hospital. We had our children at Harrison County Hospital, all three of us,” she said.
Lieber said many OB physicians want a better work-life balance with a steadier schedule and less time on-call. Granting those requests can be taxing when it comes to the needs of a small region.
“A lot of the providers are either looking to retire or in their retirement. They’re telling us that they want to do hospital-based work. So they might just want to be a laborist. They want to go to a hospital where they just work a 12-hour shift. They just deliver who comes into that hospital. In our community, that just doesn’t work. We can’t operate that way,” said Dougherty.
For OB departments with declining birth rates, the challenge lies in compensation. Each year, Indiana’s low Medicaid base rates force hospitals to cover about $2.7 billion in unpaid health care expenses, according to IHA President Scott B. Tittle.
“Which is one of the reasons so many hospitals are struggling financially today, and some must make the difficult and unfortunate decisions to eliminate certain health care services, especially in rural areas,” he said.
Maternity care desert impacts
When OB units close, pregnant women must find new providers. Brittany Duke had three daughters at Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City before switching to Deaconess Women’s Hospital in Newburgh to deliver her fourth daughter in 2024.
“It’s easier for my family to be around [PCMH]” she said. “I already knew how everything ran down here, and I felt so comfortable with it all. It was stressful having to figure out whether New Albany, Jasper, Owensboro [KY] or Evansville would be the best.”
  Indiana Hospital Association President Scott Tittle
Hoosier women living in maternity care deserts travel three times farther for services than those with full access, according to the March of Dimes. Lexie Pendleton, a former nurse in Harrison County Hospital’s OB unit, said some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care before the closure.
“Now they are being forced to drive an extra 20 minutes on top of that to get to a hospital with obstetric care and also to see their providers for their prenatal visits,” she said.
Hill said additional travel time for OB services can become a significant issue for expectant mothers.
“Especially for those moms with high-risk pregnancies or chronic diseases, or even those moms who are having perfectly healthy pregnancies but end up in an obstetric emergency,” said Hill. “Women with chronic conditions have about a 51% increased likelihood of preterm birth.”
The March of Dimes disclosed that 15.5% of pregnant women in Indiana received inadequate prenatal care, a higher percentage than the U.S. rate of 14.8%. Plus, only 2.5% of OB providers practiced in rural counties while 4.5% of babies were born to women living in those areas.
“We are dedicated to trying to remain a place where people could grow their family if it is feasible to be able to do so,” said Dougherty. “We’d like to be a resource to help set people up if they need prenatal care and don’t know where to go. We can help them find those resources through our [gynecology] office. But they could also go to their family practice doctor and figure out where to start.”
Advocating for solutions
For expectant moms looking for an OB provider outside their county, getting recommendations from other women with similar experiences is helpful. Kate Kenealy, who delivered a stillborn infant and a rainbow baby at Harrison County Hospital, said finding the right environment is essential.
“Ask your friends who have kids, who have gone through OBGYN offices for whatever reason, ask them about the atmosphere,” she said. “[The Harrison County Hospital OB unit was] there for us. For all the moms, for all the dads, for all the babies. They were there for us personally and medically, for their career, but mainly because they cared about us.”
Expanded access to accredited and licensed freestanding birth centers and mobile health centers would also make a difference, according to Hill. March of Dimes has Mom and Baby Mobile Health Centers in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, D.C. and New York with plans to launch more in Ohio, Texas and Alabama. 
“If anyone is interested in joining us in doing that, both on the provider side as well as sponsorship side, we’d love to see that come to Indiana,” said Hill.
  Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager at Harrison County Hospital
As for birth rates and compensation, Tittle said House Bill 1004 has a provision that would draw more federal Medicaid funds at no cost to the state.
“With these additional federal dollars, we can enhance much-needed reimbursement rates for hospitals, which will best enable rural birthing hospitals to improve access and health outcomes for Hoosier mothers and babies,” he said.
Another focus area for improvement is diversifying the workforce with midwifery care and other specialties.
“Making sure our emergency rooms, whether there is an obstetric unit there, are trained in obstetric emergencies because we know when we do see a unit close due to maybe low volume, that those women, if they do have an emergency, they’re going to their emergency room,” Hill said.
Despite the struggles, Harrison County Hospital has not given up on its quest to reopen labor and delivery services. Dougherty said the facility is working with three recruitment agencies, including one based in Bloomington. It would likely take four OB providers to reinstate the unit, according to Lieber.
“Could be an OB-GYN, a family practice with an OB fellowship would be someone we would look at. Midwives, we’ve opened that up. So we’re looking at all avenues of ways we could staff the department,” she said.
Hill advised women to raise awareness about their maternity care desert experiences.
“Have that conversation with providers, but also with your representatives and your legislators about how that impacts your life. Change can’t be made unless there are voices saying that it does need to be made,” she said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma lawmakers are clearly scared to death of their constituents, and who could blame them?
After all, voters in recent years have forced our lawmakers to come face-to-face with the terrifying reality that average Oklahomans can band together to circumvent the Legislature’s will and force the passage of new progressive laws and block boneheaded conservative policies.
In short, by taking matters into their own hands by expanding Medicaid access for the working poor and reducing the state’s over-incarceration rates through criminal justice reforms, voters have repeatedly been serving lawmakers an unwanted reminder that the influence of rural Oklahoma is dwindling as the state’s population continues to shift to more politically diverse urban centers.
I can understand how that must be a scary prospect for a Republican-led governing body whose members typically take immense pride in thinking up conservative policies. And, I suspect that’s probably why lawmakers continue to monkey around with Oklahomans’ constitutionally guaranteed right to put their own proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot.
It’s already an uphill battle to qualify measures for the ballot considering the enormous signature collection requirements — over 92,000 for a statutory change and over 172,000 for a constitutional amendment — and the 90-day window to gather those.
But just when you think it can’t get any worse, Republican lawmakers, led by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Sen. David Bullard, are telling us to hold their beer. In case you’re not familiar with the idiom, it’s what people say when they’re about to do something extremely foolish that they’ll likely regret later.
Oklahoma lawmakers are plowing ahead with a bizarre — and likely unconstitutional — scheme that seeks to disproportionately inflate the influence of rural voters at the expense of urban and suburban ones. 
They want to cap how many people living in each county can sign petitions. At most, that means only 20.8% of signatures can come from one county, which potentially disenfranchised tens of thousands of their constituents. 
And, among other things, their latest scheme also prevents people who live outside the state from working here to collect signatures, requires them to only be paid by Oklahoma entities and allows an appointed bureaucrat with no legal experience to decide how ballot summaries should be worded.
Supporters say these changes will ensure rural voters have a bigger say on what’s included on the ballot by forcing signature collectors to visit rural communities. Critics argue it attempts to dilute the influence of those living in urban counties.
Whatever the reasoning, the entire concept is an expensive lawsuit waiting to happen. Taxpayers should expect to foot that bill because the moment Gov. Kevin Stitt’s pen turns this into law, our state is going to get sued for violating people’s constitutional rights. 
And, they should.
Last time I checked, we lived in a state where every citizen is worth the same regardless of where they live. It’s mindboggling to argue that rural perspectives are worth more in a state where about 50% of the population lives in urban areas.
And, I’ve always lived with the philosophy that the more choices we have on the ballot, the better for our democracy. Voters, after all, deserve choice because they aren’t stupid. I may not agree with every ballot measure, but I respect my neighbor’s ability to put it up for a vote.
Unfortunately, I don’t think many of our lawmakers have that same philosophy. Let’s be honest, how often do we hear Republican legislators insult our intelligence by insisting that we don’t know what is best for ourselves or we didn’t understand what we voted for. 
Lawmakers always think they know what’s best for us — until voters are given the power to put some of those crazed ideas in their proper place — the trash can.

In September, the convictions of Robert and his brother David Bintz in the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison were overturned. The brothers left prison more two decades after they were convicted. 
“I missed my mom, before she died,” Robert Bintz told the Examiner in November. His mother passed away while he was incarcerated. “I missed my niece, Hannah. Got killed by a horrible car accident… I missed my job I once had.”
Upon his release from prison, Robert didn’t receive any reentry assistance from the state, according to his compensation request to the Wisconsin Claims Board in February. His sister isn’t able to meet his complex needs, the request said. 
The brothers are seeking $2 million apiece from the state for their imprisonment. Their compensation requests cite high anticipated costs for health care. 
“He’s 68 years old,” Isaiah Eastling, Robert’s nephew, told the Examiner in November. “It’s not fair for him to have to go and get a job like all of us, and just to try to get back into society like that. That’s impossible.”
Wisconsin law caps compensation for wrongful imprisonment at $25,000, unless the state Legislature grants more compensation, which is rare.
To award money, the Wisconsin Claims Board must find that evidence of innocence is “clear and convincing” and that the petitioner did not contribute to bring about their conviction and imprisonment by something they did or failed to do.
Jarrett Adams, an attorney working with the Bintz brothers, doesn’t yet know if they have a claim for a federal lawsuit, he said in late February. He said the brothers might not have an opportunity to get compensation if the state does not award it.
Robert’s sister, Cindy Eastling, said Robert called her every week when he was in prison. But she “had no idea that he had all these health issues.”
With little time to prepare, Eastling wasn’t ready for Robert’s arrival, she told the Examiner in November. His eye and arm were bruised, and he later told her he was beat up, she said.
He requires around-the-clock care and 20 daily medications for physical and mental health conditions, which worsened without sufficient medical attention in the prison system, according to his compensation claim. Eastling said her brothers will probably need assistance for the rest of their lives, and that they could be taken advantage of on their own.
“Bobby knows I love him, but it really took a toll on me,” Eastling said. “…I wasn’t prepared, and then the way he showed up, he looked absolutely horrible… he looks so much [healthier] now. We’re doing one physical problem at a time.”
Eastling said Robert’s asthma had improved. He used to use a nebulizer multiple times a day, she said. When Eastling spoke to the Examiner, he hadn’t used it in three weeks.
“Honestly, it scared me,” Eastling said. “I thought one morning I’d wake up and he’d be dead.”

The brothers have health care coverage, but it’s a challenge at times, Carla Broadnax of Jarrett Adams Law said in late February. 
Broadnax said that “accessing consistent care is persistently tricky, partially due to the cost associated with transportation, medical appointments, and necessary medications.” 
Housing has been an issue for both brothers, according to the compensation requests filed in February. After trying to find housing at shelters, David found a place to stay in Appleton through the help of a local nonprofit. 
David’s shared housing situation is temporary and not sufficient to meet his needs, as of his compensation request. Robert’s request said he hasn’t been able to acquire housing that can assist him with the round-the-clock support needed. 
Cindy Eastling thinks the system should work faster to support her brothers in the short term. A GoFundMe for David Bintz raised $4,165, with a $10,000 goal. Robert’s GoFundMe raised $12,829 with a $20,000 goal. David’s compensation request said his monthly disability and social security payments cover only his most basic needs. 
“This leaves everybody scrambling, [when] somebody like David and Robert gets out,” Adams said. “Everybody’s just trying to do what they can.”
Adams himself was once incarcerated and released after his conviction was overturned,and he co-founded the organization Life After Justice, which supports wrongfully convicted people. In late February, he said the brothers are receiving mental health care through the organization.

“…He’s holding back a lot of things, I can tell,” Cindy Eastling said about Robert Bintz. “And he’s always happy, but bad things happened to him in there.” 
How were the Bintz brothers prosecuted? 
In 1999, the brothers were charged with the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Testing of semen from a rape kit found that it didn’t belong to the brothers, and blood found under Lison’s body was not theirs. 
Additional DNA testing obtained by the Wisconsin Innocence Project in 2006 confirmed that blood found on Lison’s dress came from the same male whose sperm was found in the rape kit, according to the exonerations registry. A motion for a new trial was denied.
The Brown County Attorney’s Office prosecuted the brothers with a theory of robbery and murder. After the brothers’ exoneration in September, Brown County District Attorney David Lasee spoke to NBC 26.
“The prosecutors and the law enforcement officers were handling this case at the outset, followed the evidence that they had at that time, and that conviction was sound,” Lasee said.
Evidence against the brothers included statements from incarcerated people who said David had admitted to the crime.
In an interview with detectives, David Bintz eventually agreed to a statement that he and his brother were involved and that his brother had strangled Lison, according to David’s page in the National Registry of Exonerations. At the same time, he gave contradictory statements that he wasn’t involved and was home at the time of the crime.
David Bintz’s request for compensation claims that Bintz, who was intellectually disabled, was interrogated for over six hours, “depriving him of food, water and restroom breaks in clear violation of his rights.”
“During the interrogation, David Bintz maintained his innocence, but after several hours, he made confused and contradictory statements — some of which confirmed Swendby’s allegations, others which stressed his innocence,” the request states.
The request says David was coerced by the pressure and tactics of the detectives and signed a false statement implicating himself and Robert Bintz in Lison’s murder.
The Examiner asked Jarrett Adams Law about the sources the firm used for a section of the compensation request about the confession. Facts in the firm’s complaint, findings from investigative reports and communication with the Bintz brothers provided the context and basis for that part of the request, Broadnax said. 
Of 375 DNA exonerations between 1989 and 2020 tracked by the Innocence Project, over a quarter involved a false confession. 
The brothers had multiple convictions prior to their convictions in Lison’s murder, according to Brown County court records. In 1997, David was sentenced to prison for sexual assault. 
Jarrett Adams said that the identity of Lison’s attacker is now known and “nothing else matters but that. It wasn’t them.” 
Last year, investigative genetic genealogy linked crime scene evidence to three male children of a couple in the Green Bay area. In August, the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory determined that substances at the crime scene pointed conclusively to William Hendricks, who had a history of violent sexual attacks before his death in 2000. 
“The notion that Ms. Lison was having a secret sexual relationship with a recently-released convicted rapist is utterly implausible,” the Great North Innocence Project said in a motion to vacate Robert Bintz’s conviction, according to the exonerations registry.  
Life after exoneration
If the Bintz brothers receive compensation from the state, they have ideas for how to use it beyond paying for health care expenses. In late February,  Broadnax told the Examiner about the brothers’ plans.

They both want to own a home, she said. In an interview with the Examiner, David talked about helping others.“I’d help a couple people out that ain’t got nothing,” he said.
Robert wants to travel and see the world, and David wants to eat home-cooked food, Broadnax said. 
“The food was straight garbage,” David said of the food in prison. “Half [the] time, I didn’t eat the food. I just bought stuff off canteen if I could.”
David has been making cards, Broadnax said. He sends cards to about four to five incarcerated people, and also uses his cards and designs to help with the decor at Mountains of Hope, the nonprofit through which he found a place to stay. 
“That was my hobby,” David said. “When I knew I was getting out, he wanted me to leave all my art supplies behind. I said ‘No, I’m not leaving my stuff behind. I’m still going to do this when I get out.’”

Richard Stallings and Larry LaRocco, both D-Idaho, will hold a bipartisan event titled “Boise Town Hall on Accountability, the Economy, and the Future of American Democracy” on Saturday.
The event, which will be held from 2-4:30 p.m. in Downtown Boise at the Egyptian Theatre (700 W. Main St.), is the latest in a series of public forums held by the former Idaho congressmen. They have previously visited Nampa, McCall, Lewiston, Moscow, Post Falls and Idaho Falls.
Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, along with Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, have refused to hold public town halls or explain their votes,” a press release announcing the town hall said. “In response, Stallings and LaRocco are doing the job Idaho’s current members of Congress won’t: showing up, listening, and standing up for the people. Boise marks the next stop in this statewide effort to give Idahoans the voice their current leaders deny them.”
Stallings and LaRocco will be joined by former Republican Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones and former Republican Montana Gov. Marc Racicot.
“Together, these bipartisan voices will lead a discussion on the growing threats facing Idaho families, the economy, and American democracy — and offer the public a chance to ask real questions and get real answers,” the press release said.
The town hall is sponsored by the Idaho Democratic Party, Idaho Women Forward and the Idaho Young Democrats.
The event is free and open to the public, but attendees are encouraged to reserve tickets online.
LaRocco represented Idaho’s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 to 1995. Stallings represented Idaho’s 2nd Congressional District in the U.S. House from 1984 to 1992.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers seeking to slow down annual minimum wage increases that Nebraska voters approved in 2022 have reached a new deal to avoid the law’s inflationary increases.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Stan Clouse of Kearney said they have found a “compromise” for Raybould’s Legislative Bill 258 that would completely remove permanent annual cost-of-living increases to the state minimum wage, beginning in 2027. 
Under the Clouse amendment, the wage would increase instead by 1.75% annually in perpetuity. Under the current law, workers could see much larger increases. Average inflation for the past five years was 4.18%. Over the past 10 years, it was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest.
“It’s certainty, and I like certainty, and I like minimizing the risk,” Clouse said at the beginning of April, when he pitched a fixed annual increase rather than a sliding scale tied to inflation.

Raybould said her motivation and why she keeps pushing “passionately” for her measure is to help small businesses and others who might not be able to absorb the cost of rising wages that she said could pass on costs to consumers.
“I know that this is the right thing to do, to create a balance,” Raybould said this week. “You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford.”
Clouse has said that unless his amendment has been attached to LB 258 before the end of the next four-hour debate on LB 258, he will not vote for the measure. His vote matters because overcoming a filibuster requires 33 votes, and Clouse is likely Raybould’s 33rd vote. 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has filed multiple motions and amendments to try to prevent his amendment from being attached, one of the opponents who say Raybould’s bill goes against voters.


Minimum wage types

Federal minimum wage: Created in 1938, now $7.25.
Nebraska minimum wage: Created in 1967, now $13.50.
Nebraska tipped employees minimum wage: Created in 1970, now $2.13. Wages plus gratuities must equal or exceed the Nebraska minimum wage under state law.
Nebraska training wage: Created in 1991, now $5.44 (75% of the federal minimum wage) for up to the first 90 days of employment for a worker younger than 20 years old.
Nebraska student-learners minimum wage: Created in 1987, now $11.25 (75% of the Nebraska minimum wage) for workers who are part of a vocational training program.
Nebraska youth minimum wage: Does not currently exist.



Raybould’s amended proposal
Nebraska first enacted a state minimum wage of $1 in October 1967, 29 years after Congress passed a federal minimum wage, first at 25 cents for select workers. The federal minimum wage sets a floor for workers’ pay when state wages don’t keep up.
The Nebraska minimum wage did not overtake the federal minimum wage until voters acted in 2014, increasing it to $9 by January 2016.
In 2022, voters acted again and decided to permanently go around the Legislature, opting for annual $1.50 increases through 2026, up to $15, before shifting to annual cost-of-living adjustments.
Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive who was elected to the Legislature in 2022, first proposed capping annual minimum wage increases to up to 1.5% in 2023. Former State Sen. Tom Briese of Albion, now the state treasurer, had a separate measure seeking to amend the state training wage for teen workers, while also seeking to create a “youth minimum wage” for 14 or 15 year olds.
The training wage was first established in July 1991, allowing employers to pay workers younger than 20 a lower wage for up to the first 90 days of employment. The wage expired after March 1993 but returned in September 1997.
LB 258 would exempt 14 or 15 year olds from the training wage but create a subminimum wage for the youngest workers that could stay in place until they age out.
Raybould’s version of the original Briese proposal, in LB 258, includes the following:

The training wage would be limited to teen workers ages 16 to 19. It would rise to $13.50 this September and, beginning in 2027, increase by 1.5% each year. The training wage in Nebraska has been tied to 75% of the federal minimum wage since 2007. With the $7.25 federal wage not increasing since 2009, the training wage has been locked at $5.44.
The youth minimum wage would be created for 14 or 15 year olds, exempting them from the training wage. It would start at $13.50 in January 2026 and increase every fifth year by 1.5%.

The state minimum wage for adults and older teens would rise by 2065 to $29.51 under Clouse’s amendment. That’s the same point at which the new youth minimum wage would finally catch up to the $15 baseline wage that voters approved for all Nebraska workers in 2022, starting next year, based on an analysis by the Nebraska Examiner of the impact of the Clouse and Raybould language.



The disparity between the state minimum wage and the youth wage would grow over time, from about 90% of the state wage in 2026 to about half of the Nebraska rate by 2065. That’s young workers born after 2050.
The training wage would be $24.13 in 2065, or about 82% of the state minimum wage. Raybould said it’s critical to correct an “oversight” from past legislation and ballot measures that left out increases to the training wage and sever that wage from the stagnant federal rate.
OSHA and emancipated minors
Emancipated minors would be paid the full state minimum wage as older workers, which Raybould and supporters have said would help some young parents or youths who need the most support.

However, very few minors are granted emancipation, according to court data that Conrad requested and shared with the Examiner. In the report, 143 emancipation cases were filed with the judicial system, dating back to 2019 and including the early part of 2025.
Over that period, the court system granted 65 youths emancipation, and eight more cases were pending. It’s unclear how many of those minors were 14 or 15 years old. 
Local businesses sought to employ 2,874 teens aged 14 or 15 in 2022, according to a March 2023 Nebraska Department of Labor report.
Raybould said she continues pushing for the youth minimum wage partly because of child labor laws that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration helps enforce. Under the requirements, a 14- or 15-year-old can only perform certain non-hazardous or non-manufacturing duties or work certain hours. Businesses face severe penalties for noncompliance.
These teen workers can’t work more than three hours on a school day or more than 18 hours during a school week. Work hours are restricted between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except around the summer when night hours are extended to 9 p.m.
Raybould said she’s heard from many business leaders who say they would hire 14- or 15-year-old workers but that the same minimum wage coupled with OSHA restrictions is a disincentive for doing so. 
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said her family, which operates B&R Stores, Inc., the parent company of Super Saver, Russ’s Market and other local grocery stores, hasn’t hired those youngest workers for about 20 years “for the very reason of the equipment and things they are not permitted to do.”
If the youth wage were established, she said some businesses might reconsider hiring young workers. However, she said her grocery stores wouldn’t because of “too many restrictions.”
Raybould retired as vice president of her family company, founded in 1964, at the end of March. She continues to serve as vice chair of the company board and has filed a conflict of interest statement on her measure.
LB 258 would not be the final say on minimum wage, Raybould added, as future lawmakers or voters could still act. She noted employers also would not be prohibited from paying more than the minimum wage or from not adopting training or youth wages. She said she realizes workers, during a workforce shortage, are looking for competitive wages, benefits and hours.
Raybould’s bill would not change the $2.13 minimum hourly wage paid to workers earning tips or gratuities, which hasn’t changed since 1991.
‘Basic civics’
Conrad, who helped run the 2014 ballot measure that brought the state minimum wage above the federal rate, and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who helped lead the 2022 measure, have led opposition to Raybould this spring. All three are Democrats, with Raybould standing alone among her progressive colleagues in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
Much of the opposition cites the “will of the voters” in 2022, when the McKinney-backed measure secured about 59% support statewide and majority support in 38 of 49 legislative districts.

Conrad blasted the creation of a youth wage as viewing young workers as “subhuman” and urged Raybould to show where in her campaign she said she would “stick it to low-income working families.”
“The frustration is that you shouldn’t have to explain basic civics to adult state senators,” Conrad said during the earlier debate.
As a freshman lawmaker in 2007, Conrad helped keep the state minimum wage on track with the federal minimum wage after a last-minute emergency congressional spending bill, focused on disaster relief for Hurricane Katrina and funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, passed with minimum wage increases.
The first bill Conrad ever introduced, in 2007, sought to increase the state minimum wage and seek regular inflationary changes, while also increasing and narrowing the state training wage and tying the tipped-worker wage to 50% of the state minimum wage. 
One of the lobbyists opposing that bill is now a freshman senator, State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse. He was representing the National Federation of Independent Business.
A much-narrowed version of Conrad’s bill came to fruition at the tail-end of the 2007 legislative session, which inadvertently led to a temporary 53-day decrease in the state training wage because of differences in the timing of the state and federal laws taking effect, a hiccup that was added when Conrad’s bill was amended into a similar bill.



‘Stuck in a cycle’
Speaking with the Examiner this week, Conrad said the debate needs to remain focused on voters and low-income families or low-income working young people, who she said would be most hurt by LB 258.
“Anything that has caused us to lose sight of the true impacts of these harmful measures is a distraction, and if Senator Raybould wants to perpetuate some sort of personal attacks or can’t defend her own position in financial conflict, that’s on her,” Conrad said. “Senator Raybould is not a victim.”
Conrad said she and Raybould have been friends for a long time and agree on more than they disagree. While this “sharp disagreement … is painful for both of us,” Conrad said she continues to consider Raybould a friend.

McKinney has said a “common theme” of the 2025 session so far has been to go against voters, whether it be weakening paid sick leave, medical cannabis or minimum wage measures. He called it “sad, to say the least.” He unsuccessfully tried to raise the state minimum wage with legislation in 2021, before leading the 2022 ballot measure.
“When you have stagnant wages, you have people stuck in a cycle,” McKinney said during the previous debate. “And then you have people telling people to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps, do all these things, but we have stagnant wages.”
Raybould has described her bill as exercising the Legislature’s referendum power to modify, amend or repeal voter-enacted laws. 
‘A very temporary measure’
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee that advanced Raybould’s bill, said she was very much against the Raybould and Briese ideas when the youth minimum wage would have applied to 16 or 17 year olds.
Once Raybould limited the youth minimum wage to 14 or 15 year olds, citing the federal restrictions, Kauth came on board.
“Raising the minimum wage does nothing more than a very temporary measure to make you feel good for a little bit,” Kauth said.

She continued: “If you have not improved your skills, you haven’t taken on more responsibility, got more education, or done something to differentiate yourself and improve, then everybody’s going to just kind of float at that same level and everything becomes more expensive.”
Looming reelection decision
Next year, Raybould will have a choice to make on whether she runs for reelection, but she said she has “never cared, not ever” about whether she is reelected. Instead, she said she cares about “doing the right thing every day for the right reasons that help the most Nebraskans.”
She said she’s heard from constituents who have thanked her for the measure, as well as others who have called her self-serving, self-centered and selfish. Of the hits, she said, “I just have to take those.”
Raybould said her constituents know her, that she is informed and does her “homework,” and that her 2026 reelection decision is up to central Lincoln voters. She previously served four years as a Lancaster County commissioner and eight years as a member of the Lincoln City Council, and she was the Democratic candidate in 2018 against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
“It’s really up to them to make that decision if they want me to run again or if they want someone else,” Raybould said. “And if they want someone else, I would support that too.”



Eligibility for the Nebraska, federal minimum wage
The federal minimum wage did not apply to most workers until 1978:

In October 1938, the wage went into effect for employees engaged in interstate commerce or in producing goods for interstate commerce.
Beginning September 1961, at a slightly lower rate than interstate commerce employees, the wage extended to workers of large retail or service enterprises, as well as those in local transit, construction or gas stations.
By February 1967, state or local government employees in hospitals, nursing homes and schools, as well as workers in laundries, dry cleaners and large hotels, motels, restaurants or farms were covered. Between 1970 and 1978, farm workers were paid at a lower rate.
Beginning January 1978, the federal minimum wage extended to most nonexempt workers at one minimum wage, $2.65 at the time.

Nebraska created a state minimum wage in 1967, applying in that case to workers not covered by the federal minimum wage until 1978. The Nebraska minimum wage has now surpassed the federal minimum wage and must be paid to all workers in businesses employing four or more employees. For smaller businesses, the federal minimum wage must be paid.

Not anymore.
Idaho Senate signs off on proposed anti-marijuana constitutional amendment

Skaug, a Nampa Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.













Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug





“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
 Polling shows most adults say cannabis should be legal for medical, recreational use

Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
  Rep. Bruce D. Skaug, R- Nampa, listens to proceedings on the House floor at the State Capitol building in Boise on Jan. 23, 2024. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the Legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the Legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the Legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.

She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP super majority-controlled Statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“This is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their Legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles recently passed the Legislature. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”

With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the Legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)In the summer of 1959, the west Yellowstone region experienced one of the largest Rocky Mountain earthquakes in instrumented history.
The M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake caused severe damage and killed 28 people, most notably due to a landslide into a campground in Madison Canyon downstream from Hebgen dam. Here, roughly 30 million cubic meters (imagine 30 million washing machines!) of material from the north-facing slope of Madison Canyon came crashing down in the night, burying the campground and damming the Madison River to form Earthquake Lake.
We have learned a lot from destructive historic earthquakes like that at Hebgen Lake. The evidence it left on the landscape, such as fault scarps (steep breaks in slope where vertical displacement occurred along the fault), are especially important for understanding prehistoric earthquakes.
The study of such earthquakes, called paleoseismology, can help to better characterize earthquake-producing faults by providing information about the recurrence and magnitudes of past earthquakes.
  These are the epicenters of 6,188 earthquakes in the Hebgen Lake region since 1990 as determined by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations and the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology. All epicenters have horizontal uncertainties of 1.0 km or less. Black contour lines show subsidence (in 2-foot intervals) resulting from the 1959 M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake (epicenter shown by red star).

Lakes are becoming increasingly popular in paleoseismic studies. Their regular sedimentation patterns can refine earthquake-timing estimates and can potentially capture earthquakes that may not have ruptured the ground surface but still produced substantial ground shaking.
This subdiscipline is called lacustrine paleoseismology and has been typically practiced in deep, steep, glacially influenced lake systems, like those along the Teton Range to the south.
Because the impacts of the Hebgen Lake earthquake have been documented, a thorough understanding of how this earthquake affected nearby lake basins could teach us to interpret hidden earthquake records in different types of lakes — especially in shallow lakes with gentle slopes, like Henrys Lake just west of West Yellowstone in Idaho.
In the late winter of 2023, our team from the U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Science Center set out to Henrys Lake with the hypothesis that this shallow lake basin contains evidence of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. Because Henrys Lake is only about about 15 miles from the earthquake epicenter and therefore experienced strong to very strong shaking, it is fair to assume that lake sediment may have been disturbed.
To test this hypothesis, we extracted seven sediment cores, each about a little over 6 feet long, along an east-west transect across Henrys Lake during winter 2023. A benefit of working on lakes in the winter is that standing on solid (icy) ground can offer a steadier working environment than trying to collect sediment cores from a boat. Just like ice fishing, we used an ice auger to make a hole through the frozen lake surface and plunged the coring device into the water and then into the lake floor, keeping it leashed on a rope to pull it back up once the sediment was collected.
The cores were examined at the USGS Pacific Coastal Marine Science Center core lab, which is specially equipped for imaging and sampling sediment cores.
A common signature of earthquake disturbance within sediment cores results from sediment failure of the lake margin, transport downslope, and deposition in central areas of the lake basin. Cores from multiple locations in Henrys Lake contained a thin (2 inch), distinct, gray sandy layer in their upper portion that appeared to be a record of a recent earthquake.
The challenge was then to test if this layer matched the timing of the 1959 earthquake.
This was done by measuring the concentration of the chemical component Cesium-137 (137Cs) with depth. 137Cs was produced during atmospheric nuclear testing in the mid-20th century, so the concentration in sediment can be matched with the known frequency of nuclear testing through time to establish the age of the sediment layer.
For example, above ground nuclear testing increased around 1954, and the concentration of 137Cs in sediments starts to grow from undetectable levels to detectable that year. Conversely, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963, so sediment of this age has peak 137Cs concentration that drastically drops immediately thereafter (which is toward the top of the core in the most recently deposited sediment).
These defined concentration levels should essentially bound the 1959 earthquake deposit in the sedimentary record!
So, what about that outstanding layer of sand hypothesized to be associated with the 1959 earthquake? When pairing the 137Cs concentration data with the sedimentological data, we found that the sand deposit was indeed bracketed between 1954 and 1963, providing solid evidence that this layer probably formed during the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.
  This is a photo and graphic of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake deposit in sediment core from Henrys Lake, Idaho, with references to Cesium-137 activity (or concentration). Changes in Cesium-137 are related to atmospheric nuclear tests and provide a means of dating the deposit; those measurements are plotted on the right with depth of the core. (Courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)
With evidence that sediment at the bottom of Henrys Lake does, indeed, contain records of past earthquakes, the next goal was to look for other prehistoric earthquakes using the 1959 Hebgen Lake deposit as a reference.
However, there were no such similar deposits with the same sediment character and presence in multiple cores. Using radiocarbon dating techniques, we were able to establish that the very lowest portions of the cores were approximately 5,000 years old.
Does this mean that there have not been earthquakes similar in intensity to the Hebgen Lake earthquake in the last 5,000 years? Not exactly.
The lowermost layer of the cores — the 5,000-year-old layer — is consistent with deposits from a marshy wetland, not a lake at all! Marshy wetlands are saturated areas with a lot of plants and grasses that typically produce organic-rich soils and not finely layered sediment like lakes do, making them much less likely to record an earthquake.
Based on estimates of sedimentation rate, it appears that Henrys Lake likely only changed from a marshy wetland to a shallow lake less than about 1,000 years ago.
Although there is a lot more to explore about the specific evolution of Henrys Lake and other lakes in the west Yellowstone area, it is promising that a shallow lake with gentle sloping margins can record earthquake shaking. These findings provide increased confidence in our ability to investigate shaking-related deposits in other lakes with similar characteristics in the Rocky Mountain region or beyond.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee soybean farmers already on the heels of a tough year are now facing challenges posed by the remnants of early April floods.
Gina Ward’s low-lying fields near Rives and the Obion River flooded in February, requiring the third-generation farm to make costly repairs to the private levee attached to their land.
Just a few weeks later, the majority of the levee was once again washed away in a near-record-setting flood after rain drenched Northwest Tennessee and surrounding areas.
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
When the water finally began to recede from Ward’s drowned fields about 10 days later, it left craters and debris. 
“It looks like the surface of the moon now,” she said.
Soybeans cover more acres than any other row crop in Tennessee, according to the University of Tennessee. The crop is most popular in the state’s west and central regions.
April typically marks the beginning of the planting season. Ward had not yet planted her fields when the storms began on April 3, but she wants to get seeds in the ground as soon as possible to maximize her yield. 
She has started planting in fields on higher ground. But the sandy moonscape left behind by the flood in lower-lying areas will take a lot of time and work before it’s ready to be planted again, Ward said.

Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Production Council, said most of the flooded land was not planted. 
“The farmers who farm that low-lying ground know that it’s best to wait as long as possible to get outside of flooding season before they start planting that ground,” he said.
But the flooding has pushed back their planting dates, which could lead to lower yields.
“Conventional wisdom in any farming is to get your crop in early, and that’s going to be a little difficult to do on hundreds of thousands of acres in these flood plains, because the water is going to have to go down, and the fields will have to dry,” Maupin said.
Field maintenance could also prove expensive and time-consuming for farmers whose fields were left littered with debris, covered in sediment or rutted by receding flood water.
These delays and extra expenses compound the losses soybean farmers saw in 2024.
Soybean prices paid to Tennessee producers dropped 16% in 2024 compared to 2023, despite farmers planting around 15% more acreage, according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. 
Like any other business, a farmer’s goal is to make a return on their investment, and planting requires significant capital up front, Maupin said. Profit margins are thin due to high interest rates and inflated costs for things like fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. 
“Last year they had no profit in corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton, and they lost a lot of money,” he said. “This year, the prices and the input costs are not any better, so they needed to be able to reduce their costs as much as possible. For those who farm in these flooded areas, it is only going to drive up their costs to put a crop there.”

(Getty Images)In the relentless grip of the opioid epidemic, a surge of tragedies has changed our communities, destroyed families and taken lives.
Since 2000, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in drug overdose-related deaths, including prescription opioids. According to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drug-involved overdoses have doubled since 2015, with approximately 107,000 people dying from a drug-involved overdose. 
Need to get rid of old prescriptions? East Idaho drop off sites open April 26.

Opioid-related deaths aren’t just in the streets of Stockton or the alleyways of Portland, but rather, opioid death touches the lives of everyone in our community. 
These numbers are rising as the opioid epidemic continues to affect communities across the country — and Idaho is not immune. According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, in 2022, there were 270 opioid-related deaths across the state and 755 emergency room visits relating to an opioid overdose emergency.
Opioids are often referred to as narcotics and are medications that doctors prescribe to alleviate pain. There are many types of prescribed opioids, such as codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine. 
They are used by people of all ages and walks of life for those suffering from ailments, recovering from an injury or surgery, and needing relief from pain. As we have seen the opioid epidemic sweep across the country, we know opioids can be highly addictive and highly devastating. 
When opioids are used to manage pain for long periods, the risk of addiction rises. A prolonged period of taking opioids puts a person at risk of relying on the drug for survival. This problem is more common than it seems, with opioid overdoses taking the lives of 90 people by accident daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
Idaho’s youth is no exception to this epidemic. According to the Idaho Healthy Youth Survey, most Idaho students do not misuse prescription drugs. However, of those that do, 72.8% of them said they misuse pain relievers, 30.7% misuse depressants and 30.7% misuse stimulants. Additionally, students who misuse prescription drugs say they do so within their own homes. 
Blue Cross of Idaho and the Meridian Anti-Drug Coalition are proud to partner for the sixth time to host Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Since 2018, our annual partnership has safely disposed of approximately 1.9 tons of unwanted medication. 
On April 27, 2024, bring all your old, expired, and unwanted medications to Blue Cross of Idaho’s headquarters in Meridian to safely dispose of these substances. Our event is an opportunity to clean out that medicine cabinet and see what is expired and should be disposed of before possibly getting into the wrong hands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that take-back programs are the best way to dispose of unused or expired prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines safely. 
Opioid addiction and abuse know no bounds to who it affects; addiction does not discriminate, affecting all ages and backgrounds. It is a disease that affects families, friends, neighbors, and people we love, and maybe has affected us personally.
Join us in making a positive and long-lasting effect on our community and potentially saving a life by turning in your household prescription medications.

Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those (attempts) are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.

Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Recently, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states, including Colorado, adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Anyone with concerns about handling the manure from 25,000 cows or other issues associated with what could become North Dakota’s largest dairy are now able to submit comments to the state. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality opened a comment period Friday on the proposed Traill County facility to be operated by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy. 
The DEQ comment period runs through June 2 and includes a public hearing May 20 from 5-8 p.m. at the Hillsboro High School gym. Comments can be submitted through the DEQ website at deq.nd.gov/PublicNotice.aspx.
Riverview refers to the 25,000-cow project as Herberg Dairy, named for the township along the Red River and North Dakota Highway 200 southeast of Hillsboro where the dairy is planned. 
Riverview already has a state environmental permit for its planned 12,500-cow dairy in Abercrombie Township north of Wahpeton in Richland County. The Dakota Resource Council is challenging that permit in court.

Marty Haroldson, permits program manager of the Division of Water Quality within the Department of Environmental Quality, and other staff members from the agency were in Hillsboro earlier this month as Riverview held an open house to answer questions from the public. 
Haroldson said the plan for the Herberg Dairy is similar to Abercrombie, just on a larger scale. 
“So as far as the technology, that’s all the same, it’s just scaled up,” Haroldson said. “Manure storage ponds are going to have a larger footprint, the barns are going to be a little bit bigger, a few more people working there.” 
Haroldson said even after an environmental permit is issued, some aspects of the plan, such as manure management, can change, such as which farmers want to use Riverview’s manure as fertilizer or on which fields. 
The plan “can be a living document,” Haroldson said, but Riverview would need to document the changes. 
Water sources, processing
Two large questions are not addressed in the environmental plans for the dairy: Where will the water come from? Where will the milk go? 
Large dairy farms like the ones proposed by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy require huge quantities of water — 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow per day. 
That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site and 350,000 gallons per day for the Richland County site.
The huge water need coupled with manure output from such a large dairy has some residents in Richland County concerned about the effect on aquifers and the water supply for residents. 
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Brady Janzen, who works on site development for Riverview Dairy, said during a recent open house on the Traill County project that the company’s dairies use a combination of collected water, such as gathering rain water that runs off barn roofs, surface water and ground water. 
Riverview has a permit request under review with the North Dakota Department of Water Resources for the Richland County site northwest of Wahpeton for using surface water pulled from the Red River.  
A comment period has already been held on that permit. Another comment period will open when the department announces its intent to approve or deny the permit. 
Riverview is working with the East Central Rural Water District that serves Traill and Grand Forks counties for the site southeast of Hillsboro.  Riverview has not yet applied for a water permit for that site. 
The two dairies will use a lot of water and produce a lot of milk that would need to be processed.  The Traill dairy would fill 22 tanker loads of milk – more than 170,000 gallons per day. The Richland site would produce about half that.
“We won’t begin building until we have a processor who has a need for that milk,” Janzen said. 
Riverview already has several large dairies in western Minnesota but does not own its own creamery.
Janzen said Riverview has “kicked the tires” on building a processing plant.

Dairy farmers in the Bismarck-Mandan area, the traditional heart of North Dakota’s dairy industry, have been hurt by the closure of a creamery close to home. 
A bill in the North Dakota Legislature aims to provide some financial incentives for dairy processing. 
Amber Wood of the North Dakota Livestock Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes animal agriculture, is confident that the large dairies will mean more processing in the area.
“With dairy, it’s not the chicken or the egg, it’s the chicken and the egg,” Wood said. “You have to have processing to get cows and cows to get processing.” 
Raising concerns
While Wood is optimistic about dairy in the Red River Valley, others have concerns.

The same evening as Riverview’s Hillsboro open house, the Dakota Resource Council hosted a meeting in Fargo to raise awareness of the Abercrombie Dairy, which would be near the Red River, the drinking water source for Fargo residents.
“So why should you care? Because you’re 35 miles away,” said Madeline Luke, a volunteer with Dakota Resource Council whose main interest is in water protection, told the group. 
Luke said by the time the public became aware of the Abercrombie Dairy, there was little time to review the permit application within the comment period. She cited concerns such as the number of fields where the manure will be applied that have drainage tile installed. 
Luke was already reviewing the Herberg application on Friday.

Erik Olson has become a spokesperson for Abercrombie-area residents opposed to the dairy and addressed the Fargo meeting. The town of Abercrombie is less than four miles from the proposed dairy. 
“Riverview was well into the process of planning and developing for years before the public was made aware,” Olson said. “We have minimal time to learn and educate ourselves on the effects that this megadairy would be having.
“To say that we were shocked is an understatement.” 
The Dakota Resource Council has argued that one reason to throw out the permit is that there was no public hearing. 
Riverview has filed a motion to dismiss the Dakota Resource Council lawsuit. A ruling on that motion is pending with a Burleigh County court.

And a resounding 77% of respondents strongly agreed that focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace is a “good thing.” 
The findings are part of a data-driven effort by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce to spotlight gaps in meeting expectations of college-educated and high skilled professionals so that employers and policymakers can reverse the “brain drain” trend that has troubled the state.
 ‘Starting point’

About 700 people chose to respond to the questionnaire, which was marketed and made publicly available in the eight-county area served by the chamber. The bulk of those who participated, 86%, had at least a bachelor’s degree. Nearly 75% were white.
Done in partnership with the University of Nebraska at Omaha-based Center for Public Affairs Research, the survey was conducted in 2024 and results were presented to chamber leaders in January. But the findings are now starting to be more widely discussed. 
On Monday, UNO researchers will explain highlights to a gathering at the chamber that is expected to draw young professionals, business and other leaders.
“The more we know about what talent is seeking and wanting, the more we can key in and help elevate what is going on already — or help support improvements,” said Merrick Brtek, director of the chamber’s Young Professionals & Talent Development Programs. “Is it going to fix everything? No. But it is a starting point for us to move forward with that feedback.”
For example, she said, the chamber runs a program introducing newcomers and others to area resources, including information on Omaha’s rapid bus transit system and how to get a daily Heartland Bike Share pass. About 73% of respondents said they were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with transit options within the region.

The chamber thinks the modern-day streetcar, which has been controversial, will help and be welcomed by young professionals once its downtown-to-midtown Omaha route opens, Brtek said.
Other transit-related concerns also stood out, however. For example, 56% of respondents were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with available transit options (such as bus, train or plane) from the Omaha area to other regions like Denver, Chicago, Kansas City or Lincoln.
When it came to walk and bike friendly commutes, only 35% who participated marked extremely or somewhat satisfied.
Brtek said she was pleased to see that the bulk of participants gave a high rating to overall quality of life. About 88% said they were somewhat or extremely satisfied. 
About 69% said the same about overall cost of living, though 60% said they were dissatisfied with the cost of taxes, such as sales, income and property.
 Hybrid over remote work

Among the more surprising nuggets to Brtek was the preference that respondents had for a hybrid but primarily in-person work environment, versus more remote.
“It’s exciting that people want that community aspect — to come together, connect and collaborate,” she said.
When asked to choose which work environment was most appealing, 32% marked the hybrid but primarily in-person choice; 28% marked hybrid but equally split between in-person and remote; 19% said hybrid, primarily remote; 11% said fully in person and 10% said fully remote.

Josie Schafer, head of the UNO research team that worked on the survey, said the survey dovetails with another done in 2019 that tracked down and asked questions of high-skilled professionals who had already left the area. In that study, 78% said that they fled for professional growth and development.
It’s not that jobs weren’t available locally, said Schafer, but “density” was lacking. Participants in the earlier survey felt there was not enough upward movement in companies where top management already was set as part of a family or established network.
This latest survey, on the other hand, was focused on young professionals who currently live and work in the area.
Schafer said only about 12% said they were not satisfied with their job overall. The lowest rated workplace factor was pay, followed by opportunity for advancement at work, she said. 
“Inflation has gone up faster than wages in the Omaha area, people are feeling wage pressure, so pay is a real issue for folks,” Schafer said.
When asked which job benefits were most important, a top answer besides salary was paid time off for sickness and  vacations. 
Most respondents said they weren’t likely to try to leave their current job in the next year. But when asked if they did choose to leave, about half said they’d probably leave Nebraska completely.
Top destination states mentioned were Colorado, Illinois, California, and Texas.
‘Quality of life’
“That is concerning,” Schafer said of brain-drain, or high-skilled people with a college education exiting Husker territory for other states. She said that domestic out-migration has been a “persistent issue for at least 15 years.”

Housing opportunities also stood out as a weakness, she said. About 53% of participants said they were either extremely or somewhat dissatisfied with rental or for-sale housing that meets their size and quality needs.
Among community-centric areas of the greater Omaha area that got the highest “extremely satisfied” marks: entertainment, restaurants and bars (41%); health care services (39%): quality of educational institutions (35%) and overall quality of life (31%).
Schafer will be sharing and discussing specifics of the survey findings at the Monday gathering.
“I don’t know that we’re taking enough steps to actually create the job opportunities that keep people here or the culture of organizations that keep people here,” she said, “Or the quality of life that makes people say, ‘It is worth the difference in pay to stay here.'”



 In their own words 

Among comments survey participants took the time to write:

“City council meetings are poorly placed. I would love to get involved but Tuesday at 2 p.m. assures the city only hears business owners, retired folks and those with a flexible schedule to attend. Given the perspective of politics these days, I believe this is by design to keep common folks from participation.”
“The divide on access to services/programs and basic needs is widening. Middle income is increasingly strained and state Legislature is focused on relief for highest and lowest income earners.”
“I like the flexibility. I don’t like that most of the work is remote. It makes it hard to communicate with coworkers and get to know them.”
“When I started in 2021, the benefits system wouldn’t let me register for benefits because it said my same sex marriage wasn’t valid. Management and up regularly misgender me (I use they/them pronouns). The person who has committed the most microaggressions and discriminatory actions is our only HR person.”
“The culture of fun and employee engagement never recovered from COVID.”
“We have got to increase wages; set rental price caps; develop, enact and implement renter protections; stop with all the bars, create spaces where families are welcome but not specifically children spaces; create real public transit and incentivize environmentally conscious transportation options, repair the roads meaningfully so our cars don ‘t get eaten by potholes and we have to pay to repair our cars more frequently; do actual policy work that is going to get people to have a POSITIVE identity with Omaha.”

House Republicans want to change who has the power to appoint the state’s superintendent of public instruction — potentially stripping the State Board of Education of one of its key functions — because they say Michigan’s education system is failing.
A House joint resolution seeks to alter the state’s constitution to give the governor control over the appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The proposal comes as the state’s current superintendent is set to retire in the fall and, if it passed, would go into effect after Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s term ends.
The State Board of Education currently has the sole hiring and firing power for the position. The elected body has held that authority since 1963.
The resolution is tied to a bill that would require state board seats to be elected from geographic districts. Board seats are currently at-large, meaning whichever candidate wins the most votes wins the election, no matter where they live.
Democrats have controlled the board for much of the last two decades.
The Republican members of the House education committee voted to move the proposals forward to a vote in the full legislative body.
In order to become law, the resolution would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Republican-controlled House and the Democratically controlled Senate. It would then go before voters in the November 2026 election. If passed into law by a majority of voters, the new regulations would go into effect after Jan. 1, 2027.
Under the proposal, the state superintendent would serve a term of up to four years, as determined by the governor.
The current law allows state superintendents to remain in their positions either until they resign or are removed by the state board.
Current State Superintendent Michael Rice has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats — including Whitmer — for the lagging academic performance of schools in the state. He will leave his position Oct. 3, and the state board has already begun its search for his successor.
“Clearly, what we are doing is not working,” said state Rep. Bill Schuette, a Republican from Gladwin County, citing the state’s results on recent state and national assessments during a recent House Education and Workforce Committee hearing.
“You look across the country, we are one of the only states that has a so-called independent head of its education department, and I believe that this, in practice, has removed an important element of accountability from our state’s public education system,” Schuette added.
Rep. Regina Weiss, a Democrat from Oak Park, said during the hearing there are concerns the position could become more partisan if the change is made because the State Board of Education’s staggered eight-year terms offer more consistency.
Schuette argued that because governors are elected every four years, there would be more accountability to constituents.
“If you have a governor who wants to implement reforms or changes, and that person has a mandate directly from the people and the governor, I think that it is a better way to execute that accountability,” he said.
Schutte said he is also in favor of eliminating the state board entirely, though there are no formal proposals to do so yet.
The state board’s power has been reduced significantly over the years, particularly under the initiatives of former Gov. John Engler, a Republican who transferred a number of the board’s responsibilities to the state superintendent.
Currently, the board’s role is to establish academic standards, as well as make policy recommendations to local districts and lawmakers. It does not have the power to pass laws or to control school funding.
This month, the state board unanimously passed a resolution to oppose the proposal to strip it of its power to appoint the state superintendent.
The members agreed the potential for state education policy to change frequently due to “short-term, flashy” initiatives of new governors would cause “confusion and frustration” among school leaders.
Tom McMillin, a Republican member of the state board, said during the meeting that he’s long opposed previous efforts to shift the power of appointing the state superintendent to the governor.
“The architects of Michigan’s 1963 constitution were wise to recognize that giving too much power to the governor would be harmful and that providing authority and oversight of education to a separately elected board would be beneficial to Michigan’s children,” McMillin said in a statement. “This separation of power should remain.”

(Joe Raedle | Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.











The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology



Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)When examining the state of national politics and the federal government, there’s much to be concerned about, including President Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for deporting people legally in the country — and possibly, in the near future, U.S. citizens.
Concerned about freedom of the press? You might find it hard not to be if you note the Trump administration tried to ban the Associated Press — the gold standard for professional and fair journalism — from press conferences and has inserted right- wing bloggers in order to get favorable coverage.
It’s easy to get caught up in the doom spiral of national news, but Tennesseans would be better served, if no less sane, by turning from the scary and shiny objects in Washington, D.C., and back towards home, where members of the Tennessee General Assembly eagerly pursue a similarly anti-democratic agenda. 
Monitoring the actions of state lawmakers won’t make you feel less frustrated, but you have greater access to state representatives and senators near you to voice your concerns. 
Anti-immigration measures take priority
Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session in January presumably to push his universal school voucher program, but many political observers were surprised when Lee also added to his agenda three other items — in itself unusual, as special sessions are customarily devoted to one topic.
While vouchers remained a priority, almost as much attention was given to what Lee termed his “illegal immigration agenda.”

The legislature created a state immigration agency that would be exempt from public records law, a measure allowing public officials to be prosecuted if they vote for sanctuary city policies — which is unconstitutional, to say nothing of fact sanctuary cities have been illegal in Tennessee since 2018 — and requires immigrants in the state without permanent legal status to have driver’s licenses that mark them as such. 
“The Nazi Germans did this to the Jews,” said Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver of Nashville, referring to the Star of David sewn into clothing.
Did Republican lawmakers go far enough to make immigrants feel harassed and unwelcome? Apparently not.
As soon as the special session ended and the regular one got into full swing, Republican lawmakers began filing anti-immigrant bills right and left, including: 

Senate Bill 227/House Bill 11: Sponsored by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, the bill would hold churches and charitable organizations liable for providing housing aid to immigrants without legal status — who then go on to commit a crime. It has passed both chambers and is set to become law. 
Senate bill 836/House Bill 793 : Sen. Bo Watson, a Chattanooga Republican, is carrying a piece of legislation that would require public schools to verify the immigration status of Tennessee’s nearly 1 million students and would give schools the option of charging students without permanent legal status tuition or denying them an education. The House version, sponsored by Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland, hit snags and may not pass. 
Senate Bill 1087 /House Bill 0177: A bill making it a crime for immigrants without legal status to remain in the state for more than 72 hours stalled out in the Senate and was deferred until 2026. Senate sponsor Jack Johnson of Franklin acknowledged the measure is unconstitutional — although that has rarely stopped lawmakers with a bee in their collective bonnet. 

Media matters
The year has been marked by fewer large-scale protests in the Capitol than the two years prior, but plenty of small protests — there have been more disruptions in committee meetings than Comcast has during spring storms — and on several occasions, women protesting against anti-immigration measures have been carried out by Tennessee state troopers. 
But sometimes, even members of the media are challenged trying to cover proceedings. 
For some years, reporters have been able to freely enter the House of Representatives, as long as they stationed themselves behind a dingy plexiglass barrier near the dais, separating them from the power brokers.

No more. Now, reporters must be on a list guarded by House sergeants-at-arms, and even reporters who are members of the Capitol Hill Press Corps can’t count on being listed. At times in the last two years, Lookout reporters have been turned away despite being recognized by officials working the door, requiring a direct call from the chair of the Capitol Hill Press Corps to gain entry. 
And earlier this month, members of the media were denied access to the Senate gallery. A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said troopers who provide security and sergeants-at-arms were concerned about “exceptional interest in the day’s proceedings” and turned media away as gallery capacity was reached. 
In that instance, McNally’s staff did, within minutes, take steps to allow reporters and photographers into the gallery. 
But it shouldn’t be that difficult for reporters to be able to enter public chambers to do their jobs.
Is this a chicken or egg issue? Are Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers emboldened by Trump’s example or would they have arrived at these steps on their own? That’s hard to say, since Trump’s influence has permeated Republican-led legislators for nine years — only six years after Republicans became the Tennessee Legislature’s supermajority. 
And I’m not sure the genesis matters, because here we are. But for Tennesseans who are weary of the flood of national bad news and a feeling of helplessness, there’s a cure of sorts. Turn your TV off, look away from Washington, D.C., and turn your sights to home — where your vote has a more direct impact on those same Trump-like policies and those perpetrating them.

Like bringing back smoking rooms to Montana businesses.
This is what Senate Bill 150, now being debated by the Montana Legislature, stands to do.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt of Martinsdale, would weaken Montana’s 20-year-old Clean Indoor Air Act and allow so-called “cigar rooms” to operate in our state. If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because lawmakers have rejected it time after time in past legislative sessions. But those who put profits ahead of our health keep trying.
SB 150 will subject employees and non-smoking patrons to secondhand cigar smoke, which can cause lung cancer and heart disease and stroke, and which contains all the same toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. Every worker deserves a safe place to work – free of toxic air pollutants.
If passed, Galt’s bill as proposed with amendments will irreparably weaken our Clean Indoor Air Act, which, as stated in Montana law, is intended to “protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; to recognize the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air has priority over the desire to smoke.”
There is no way to contain cigar smoke within a room or building. Smoke filters through cracks in windows and walls, through air ducts and even through electrical outlets. And there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. If bars or brewpubs have “cigar rooms,” everyone inside the building, not just the smoking area itself, will be at risk, just as they were back in the bad old days when smoking was allowed in restaurants and on board airplanes. Say “so long” to the family environment many establishments have cultivated during the past two decades. Many Montanans may see their favorite spots opting in to allow smoking.
There is no ventilation system that can effectively protect against secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which sets engineering standards for ventilation systems, says that “the only means of effectively eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban smoking activity” from a building. Ventilation may reduce odor, but it won’t protect people’s health.
In fact, people who go inside a cigar bar or room will be at risk even when smoking isn’t taking place. Toxins from cigar smoke seep into carpet, furniture and walls and can be absorbed through the skin or by breathing in contaminated dust or by eating contaminated food. Employees charged with cleaning or otherwise maintaining a cigar bar or room will be at risk. Cigar bars or rooms can even pose a hazard for neighboring businesses.
Not only are backers of SB 150 and its amendment undermining our health and the Clean Indoor Air Act, but they also are breaking a promise made to the people of Montana. When the Clean Indoor Air Act was adopted 20 years ago, it included a four-year phase-in period for Montana’s tavern owners to make their bars and casinos smokefree. The phase-in was agreed upon by the tavern industry, legislators and some health groups. SB 150 breaks this promise, which has been held for 16 years.
The bill also runs counter to public opinion in our state. A 2021 poll by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Heart Association showed that 89% of Montana voters from across the political spectrum support the Clean Indoor Air Act, and 77% (3-in-4) of Montana voters oppose allowing cigar smoking in bars.
SB 150 breaks a promise made to Montana citizens and hospitality workers, and it undermines our Clean Indoor Air Act, which prevents disease and saves lives. We’ve had 20 years of smokefree workplaces and 16 years of smokefree bars and casinos. Why bring back the days of smoke-filled air and coming home with your clothes, skin and hair stinking of smoke?
We’ve come to expect clean, healthy air in our public spaces. Let’s not go back to the days of smoking rooms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cigar-in-ashtray-861x535-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

(Photo by Javeria Salman/The Hechinger Report)This story is part of Hechinger’s ongoing coverage about rethinking high school. See our article about a new diploma in Alabama that trades chemistry for carpentry. 
LOUISVILLE — It had been a slow morning at the Class Act Federal Credit Union. But a little after 11 a.m., a client walked through the door. 
“Who’s waiting on me?” said the elderly man, smiling.
“I will,” said Gracie Lacefield, one of three tellers behind the counter. “How are you doing? What can I help you with?” The man gave his account information to Lacefield, and then handed her his money to deposit. 
The Class Act Federal Credit Union isn’t a typical bank. Jefferson County school employees founded it in 1954 to provide educators with financial services; it began setting up  branches in high schools in 2011 as a way to offer students work-based learning. Lacefield and the two other tellers are high schoolers. 
The credit union became one small piece of a districtwide effort, Academies of Louisville, to embed career and technical education, or CTE, alongside core subjects like math and English and require every student to pick a career pathway by 10th grade.
 Piloted in 2017 at 11 high schools, the model has expanded to all 15 of the district’s main high schools. As part of that effort, the district has also launched a career exploration program at 14 middle schools, partnered with local colleges and universities to provide dual credit courses and smoothed the path for students to graduate with industry-recognized certifications. 
Ford Next Generation Learning
The Academies of Louisville is one of roughly 30 such programs that are working to provide CTE for all students, regardless of whether they plan to go to college or directly into the workforce, according to Jessica Delgado, marketing and communications director of Ford Next Generation Learning, which helps school districts adopt the approach. The Ford Motor Company Fund made Louisville part of the network in 2014.
This “CTE for all” model has grown in popularity as support for the idea of “college for all” has eroded amid high tuition costs and low completion rates. The “CTE for all” model has support from employers interested in meeting local and regional workforce needs. And some experts argue that combining workforce and academic learning makes students more engaged and helps them build professional networks.

“A lack of access to work-based learning can actually limit the career prospects and economic mobility of youth and adults,” said Kyle Hartung, associate vice president for education at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future. He noted that there’s some evidence for the effectiveness of individual “CTE for all” programs and models, although data on the impact of the approach as a whole remains scant. 
Meanwhile, the career academies model requires a significant overhaul of the traditional high school model, and without buy-in from teachers, families and local and regional business leaders, it’s unlikely to work. In late November, Anchorage School District in Alaska postponed fully adopting the model after parents and school board members raised concerns about shorter class periods and the possibility that some core subjects would be replaced by career-themed courses. 
Dozing through chemistry, engaged in welding
For Marty Pollio, now Jefferson County Public Schools superintendent, the inspiration to adopt career-oriented education sprouted from a desire to engage more students in learning. He remembers as principal of Jeffersontown High School in early 2010 walking into a chemistry class to find one of the students asleep. 
After Pollio woke him up, the student explained that he didn’t care about the class and asked why he had to learn about the periodic table. Next period, the same student was attentive and engaged in the school’s welding lab, Pollio said, even as the class talked about some of the same content the chemistry class had covered. 
“We have a kid who has a passion for welding, why are we not teaching science from that perspective? Why are we not teaching math from that perspective?” Pollio recalled thinking. He encouraged his teachers to experiment and collaborate to find real-world applications for lessons. To help make science lessons more concrete, for example, the chemistry teacher began holding her class in the welding lab and both the chemistry and welding teachers began interweaving projects and lessons into each other’s classes.

Around that time, the district was seeking to expose more students to career pathways, especially after the state legislature in 2011 expanded how it evaluates schools to include students’ career readiness, a metric it has continued to refine since. In 2014, the city of Louisville was designated a Ford Next Generation Learning Community, and it joined the network of school districts that intend to provide CTE for all students. In 2016, Jefferson County leaders and principals, including Pollio, visited nearby Nashville, one of the first cities to launch the career academies model.
Adopting the model in Louisville required a shake-up of how the schools were organized: Every school created a freshman academy and two to three career academies, each with a designated principal and counselor (in addition to the schoolwide executive principal). 
Today, across the 15 high schools, there are 56 academies offering a total of 155 different industry pathways. As freshmen, students are introduced to each career pathway available at their high school before selecting one. Sophomore year, students start taking career courses in their chosen pathway, getting hands-on education.

Depending on the pathway, students earn either an industry certification or college credit through local postsecondary institutions such as Jefferson Community and Technical College. Students from the same academy also move through the majority of their core classes together, when possible. 
At Jeffersontown High, for example, students can join one of three academies: business and leadership, build and design, or the health sciences. Within those academies, students specialize in an industry pathway like engineering, teaching and learning, welding, allied health or marketing. Students in the business and leadership academy’s financial services pathway can work at their campus Class Act Credit Union. Other schools offer pathways in fields including healthcare, aviation, manufacturing, computer science, civil service and media arts. 
The program looks a little different at every school, said Kim Morales, an executive administrator of high schools for the district. Some combine instruction in core subjects like math with career instruction while others take a less integrated approach, she said.
Academy model requires teachers to be more creative, flexible
Fern Creek High School is among the schools that have tried the combination approach. On a Tuesday morning in late December, in the school’s engineering lab, students were building robotic cars they’d spent months designing. 
Down the hall, a computer science class was reminiscent of a real-world software development company — students worked in teams as lead developers, software developers, business analysts and technical writers for a class project. A few doors down, students in the fire science pathway were creating budgets for how to invest $2,000 to expand either the fire science program or the fire department. Students would present their plans to the Fern Creek Fire Department later in the semester. 
Upstairs, juniors in the early education pathway had just completed a lesson on the characteristics needed for effective early childhood educators and had started to work on the professional resumes they’d need to land internships or part-time jobs at child care centers and preschools that partner with the district. Elsewhere in the school, culinary students studied for a certification exam, while students in the JROTC pathway practiced with air rifles for an upcoming drill competition. 
Ryan Scott, who teaches biology and Advanced Placement Biology within the high school’s engineering, computer sciences and skilled trades academy, said the academy model requires core content teachers like him to be more flexible and creative. It can also help them focus their attention on certain content because their students tend to have shared interests, he said: “I can draw specific examples from computer science, from fire science, from plumbing, to teach my biology kids things, and it gives me kind of like an anchor point.” 
In an ecology unit on how ecosystems change over time, for example, Scott said he talked with his fire science students about the impact of forest fires on an ecosystem, and how sometimes firefighters use burning in specific areas to regenerate land.

Sara Abell, a former Advanced Placement teacher who now leads the academies at Fern Creek, said her thinking on whether students need college has morphed over time. “We need to make sure that we’re preparing all of our students, and college isn’t for everybody,” she said. “Kids don’t need to go to college and waste a bunch of money just to figure out that this isn’t for them and that they could have done something in a skilled trade.”
Students say the focus on career education has shaped them in different ways. Parker Bowdy, a senior in Fern Creek’s fire science pathway, had planned to join a fire department directly after graduation. But recently he said he’s considering college because it would open up more leadership opportunities within the fire service industry. 
Rayna Stewart, a junior at Fern Creek, is in the early childhood education pathway. She plans to pursue a college degree in chemistry, but said the education pathway has taught her a lot about how kids develop mentally and physically. It’s also given her a new perspective on the teaching profession. 
“It made me think more about what my teachers have to do in order to teach us,” Stewart said. “It’s made me think about how it would be as a teacher — like, ‘Oh would I enjoy being a math teacher?’ ”
The model has not expanded to the school’s magnet, specialized or alternative high schools. That’s largely because those schools already offer their own career-focused education, said Mark Hebert, a district spokesperson.
Parental pushback in Alaska
Across the country, in Alaska, the Anchorage School District launched the Academies of Anchorage this past fall — with much controversy. The district rolled out the model with a mandatory career exploration academy for ninth graders, after deciding in June to allow older students to opt out following parental pushback. 
Then, in November, the district emailed parents announcing that it would postpone further changes for at least a year after parents, teachers and school board members raised additional concerns about budget constraints and core classes being cut or replaced in order to make room for the academy changes. In January, the district released an updated plan saying that beginning with the 2025-26 school year, each of its main high schools would offer at least two career pathways, pending budget approval, which would be open to students in all grades but not mandatory. 
Jarrett Boling, a parent with two kids in the district who has been critical of the program’s implementation, said in December that district leaders never clearly explained the academy model and why it was being launched at a time when the school system was already facing teacher shortages and a budget deficit. Nor did the district answer questions about how the model would affect students’ ability to take honors or AP classes, he said. 
He said parents were surveyed about what academies they wanted but weren’t given much context about the model except that it would help increase the district’s graduation rate and build a better working relationship with the business community. “Part of my frustrations have been, I would say, mostly steered toward the school district itself and its kind of lack of transparency and information out to the public,” he said. 
MJ Thim, chief of communications for the Anchorage School District, wrote in an email that the district would not make officials available for an interview for this story, saying that “we are reworking a few things with the program.”
Big cost, big payoff, says superintendent
While Louisville’s model hasn’t generated much criticism, it hasn’t been an easy journey.
The model is expensive: $5.7 million in startup money, in addition to annual costs. “It’s a big cost yearly for us, however the payoff is very well worth it,” said Pollio.
“What’s happened historically is our kids … the ones that are the most successful are on a pathway. The ones who are struggling the most are not. They are just randomly picking classes to graduate and that’s not good for engagement,” Pollio said.
Pollio credits the model, for example, for helping to boost the district’s graduation and postsecondary readiness rates. Those have risen from 81 percent to 87 percent, and 50 to roughly 80 percent, respectively, between 2018 and 2024, according to district officials. At this time, the school system does not collect employment data on its graduates.

District leaders said the program remains little-known in Louisville, even among some parents, in part because it can be complicated to explain. This year the district has done more to publicize it, working with KentuckianaWorks, the regional workforce development board, to expand partnerships with local and regional businesses. Helping local employers understand that the district has 22,000 kids in career and technical education who are graduating with employable skills is “going to change this city long-term,” said Pollio. 
For Fatima Avila, the Jeffersontown branch coordinator at Class Act Credit Union, the model has been transformative. 
Eight years ago, when she was a junior at Southern High School, the district launched the academies model, and a branch of the district’s credit union opened at her school. She became one of its first student employees, and continued to work there part-time while earning her bachelor’s degree in social work at Northern Kentucky University. 
After graduation, she worked at a sober living home, but the role wasn’t as hands-on as she wanted and she missed the camaraderie and relationships she’d developed working in various Class Act branches. In June 2024, after Jeffersontown High School opened its own credit union branch, Avila was hired to lead it and work with students who are in the business and health sciences academy at the school.
“When I graduated high school, I did not think I would be back at Class Act like five years later,” Avila said. But she said she enjoys how the job allows her to mentor students and work with the wider community.
Lacefield, the Jeffersontown student, said she started picking up extra hours at the credit union after school to make money and because she enjoys it so much. A sophomore in the financial services pathway, she said she isn’t sure yet about her plans after high school but the credit union experience has been a positive one. 
“I ended up really, really loving getting to work with members, getting to work with people,” Lacefield said. “I just know that I really want to stay, whether I make money or not.”

STI surveillance data is reported on a lag, so the March report issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) contains long- and short-term data ending in 2023, plus some tentative findings for 2024. But recent increases in infections could also be trends returning to their baseline prior to the pandemic. 
“If you look at the data starting in 2020 we did see some significant declines starting with the pandemic, and that is because we were seeing less testing, less healthcare visits,” said Dr. Philip Chan, a primary care physician with Brown University Health and a medical consultant on the RIDOH report.
But people’s behavior also changed during that time, Chan added. “People were more likely to stay at home, more likely to isolate. What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.”
The good news is that the state usually succeeds in treating HIV, with outcomes more positive than national averages and patients’ illness often stops before the virus progresses into AIDS. Less ideal are higher rates for other STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea, which climbed past pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
“From year to year, it’s tough to tell exactly what’s happening,” Chan said. “But I think that the trends the last couple years are clear that things are going up.”
Data for the more ubiquitous infections includes:

Syphilis has increased 58% from 2014 to 2023. There were 328 cases recorded in 2021, the highest number in decades. That fell to 240 cases in 2022, and 190 in 2023 — about the same as pre-pandemic levels, which had already risen since 2014. Preliminary data for 2024 shows similar trends. From 2020 to 2023, there were also about 10 cases of congenital syphilis — the state’s first instances in about a decade, and one example of testing’s importance in early detection, Chan said.

Gonorrhea cases rose 183.4% over the last 10 years. There were 590 cases in 2014, compared to 1,672 cases in 2023. There has not been a year with fewer than 1,000 cases since 2016. Men account for about twice as many cases as women.

Chlamydia cases have remained more consistent since 2014, and rose 21% over the decade, from 4,349 cases in 2014 to 5,269 cases in 2023. Women ages 20-24 exhibited the highest increase over that same period, but the report notes that women access routine screenings more than men, who are often asymptomatic when infected. 

“A key theme for all these STIs is that most people may not have symptoms,” Chan said. “And so the only way that you know that you may have it is to get tested, and that’s why testing is so so important.”
Chan pointed to primary care doctors and sex education as two ways people can become educated about the necessity of screening. Only 52% of adults ages 18 to 64 who had multiple sex partners received an STI test in the past year, according to 2022 data. Only 60% had ever received an HIV test.  










What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.

Demographic and geographic factors also shaped the data. Racial disparities exist: In 2023, HIV rates were four times higher among Black residents and nearly sevenfold higher among Rhode Island’s Latino population, compared to caucasian residents. New HIV cases among Latinos have risen 132% since 2019, while dropping 63% among Black Rhode Islanders. Of newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2023, 31% were diagnosed in people born outside the United States, most frequently in the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Younger people ages 15-24 account for most new STI diagnoses, about half. The state’s urban core of Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Central Falls, and Cranston consistently reports the highest STI rates, with cases numbering in the dozens to hundreds, compared to fewer than five reported cases in many smaller towns.
“A lot of these STIs do disproportionately affect communities of color and other sorts of underserved populations,” Chan said. “It’s important, from a public health perspective, to think about how to continue and promote and increase access to care for those groups in order to address disparities like we see in STIs and frankly, many other things.”

Early diagnosis, prevention making a difference 
While an assortment of drugs can stop bacterial infections, there’s no cure for HIV. But HIV-positive people are living longer than ever due to modern antiretroviral drugs that suppress the virus and prevent it from progressing to a more serious diagnosis of AIDS. An adequately suppressed viral load can also make the disease intransmissible, and greatly improves quality of life by halting the virus from replicating. Advances in HIV drug therapy largely account for the deep reduction in the rate of HIV-related deaths, which nationally fell by almost half from from 2010 to 2017.
In Rhode Island in 2022, 93.2% of people living with HIV knew their status, 76% were receiving treatment and 71% had achieved viral suppression. And 93% of people who received their medical care within Rhode Island achieved viral suppression. 
Still, there was an above average number of HIV diagnoses, the preliminary 2024 data showed. From 2019-2023, RIDOH also observed that about 20% of people newly diagnosed with HIV had progressed to stage 3, or AIDS. On average, it takes eight years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
Rhode Island has tried to prevent those outcomes by early diagnosis, and by fortifying its residents against HIV through preventative measures — namely, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients who adhere to the schedule for taking this group of antiretroviral drugs can have up to a 99% lower chance of contracting HIV from unprotected sex. PrEP provides an approximate 74% reduction in the likelihood of contracting HIV via injectable drug use.
Successful state laws from 2023 and 2024 made PrEP as widely available as possible by slashing away potential restrictions from insurers and eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Chan, only had “good things to say” about those laws — including the resulting interactions with insurers, who have largely been quick to correct mistakes in patient billing. The main challenge now, Chan said, is when interruptions occur, and a person loses their job, insurance, and access to PrEP.

 Several sexual health clinics and community health centers in Rhode Island offer low or no cost services and assist in minimizing any out-of-pocket costs associated with PrEP prescriptions and testing. For a list go to Rhode Island’s PrEP Champions Network. 

“I actually had a patient of mine for several years who had insurance and was on PrEP,” Chan said. “They lost their insurance for a couple months and had to go off PrEP, and they actually, unfortunately, acquired HIV during that time. This was just a month ago.”
RIDOH continues to promote the Rhode Island PrEP Champions Network, which has participating clinics across the state that expedite access to PrEP as well as its sibling PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken for about a month, starting within 72 hours of possible HIV exposure. Properly taken, the drug prevents HIV infection.
The comparable treatment for preventing bacterial STIs is DoxyPEP, which usually consists of a single, two-pill, dose of doxycycline taken after sex. Doxycycline is an old drug, and thus an inexpensive means of lowering contraction rates, Chan suggested. 
“DoxyPEP is the newest kid on the block,” he said, noting that the nationwide rollout is still in its early stages. But so far the data looks good, with evidence from places like San Francisco suggesting it can make a difference.
“We’re very optimistic about it, and I think the coming years will be able to tell whether or not it’s making a significant impact on overall population trends,” Chan said.

(Getty Images)Kentucky teachers took an undeserved financial hit from the Kentucky legislature during the 2025 session.
For background, the “Shared Responsibility” law (House Bill 540) was passed in 2010. The Kentucky Teachers Retirement System (TRS) board and education community members, including active and retired teachers, school board members, superintendents and experts, collaborated to find a solution.  
The bill established the TRS retiree health fund (health insurance trust), which exists independently from the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund. At the time, although suggested and requested due to a history of underfunding by the state, the legislature refused to include increased matching contributions by the state into the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund to begin addressing its much-publicized unfunded liability. 
The funding structure of HB 540 required active teachers to pay 3.75% of their salary, retired teachers under the age of 65 to pay the equivalent of the monthly cost of Medicare Part B, and school districts to contribute 3% of their gross payroll to the health insurance trust.  
Notably, HB 540 included a provision stating that once the health insurance fund achieved sufficient prefunding, as determined actuarially, the 3.75% contribution from active teachers shall be “decreased, suspended, or eliminated.” The same was true for the amount school systems paid in.
While receiving widespread praise for its collaborative development, the Shared Responsibility bill passed through the Kentucky House and Senate without any opposing votes. Gov. Steve Beshear signed it into law on April 13, 2010. 
Overall, the bill was a significant step towards securing financial support for retired teachers’ health care. It reflected a commitment to the education community while relieving Kentucky taxpayers of a $5 billion liability.  
Sounds good?  Right?  Not so fast. The 2025 Kentucky legislature put the brakes on the “shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased, suspended, or eliminated” part related to active teachers’ and school systems’ contributions to the health insurance trust.
Now that the retiree health insurance trust is nearly 100% funded, lawmakers voted to renege on the deal that was made in 2010 by passing House Bill 694 (AN ACT relating to Teachers’ Retirement System benefit funding). 
To paraphrase the new law, when the Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the health insurance trust are fully funded, the 3.75% presently going to the health insurance trust may be decreased, suspended, or eliminated. In addition, the school funding for the retiree health insurance trust will be diverted to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund.
According to the actuarial analysis of HB 694, the Teachers’ Retirement Fund will not be 100% funded until 2047. This means teachers will have to wait many more years than initially legislated to have a reduction in the 3.75% deducted from their paycheck. Heavy sigh.
Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed HB 694. In his veto message, he stated,  “House Bill 694 breaks a promise made to teachers in 2010 and does so without even giving them an opportunity for input.”  That’s right; the education community was left out of the bill-making process this time around.  
Beshear went on to mention that teachers would “need to pay much longer than the law calls for” and that “breaking this promise is unfair to the teachers we rely on to guide our children and the future of the Commonwealth.” 
Disappointingly, 67 members of the House and 29 members of the Senate voted to override Beshear’s veto, basically on partisan lines, with the overwhelming majority of the “yea” votes coming from Republicans. 
No doubt, this legislation takes money right out of the pockets of hard-working teachers. 
Like many others across Kentucky, teachers have children to raise, student loan obligations to meet, car and mortgage payments to make, utility bills to pay and groceries to buy, all on a limited budget. In addition, teachers purchase school supplies, necessities and extras for their classrooms.  
The 3.75% deducted from Kentucky teachers’ paychecks equals approximately $1,400 to $2,800 annually. This amount adds up over time while straining  teachers’ monthly budgets. This move does nothing to retain and recruit Kentucky teachers at a time when teachers are becoming harder to find. 
It is the job of those in power in the legislature to fulfill their obligations to teachers.     Transparent and authentic commitments supporting teachers that ensure fair compensation and benefits are vital in creating sustainable educational environments. Before passing legislation that hurts educators’ financial bottom line, lawmakers would be wise to keep in mind that our Kentucky public school teachers have the future of the commonwealth in their classrooms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/teachers-desk-1024x1024.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Matters of little consequence often get major time and attention. And vice versa. Two energy bills in the Colorado Legislature this year, one about nuclear energy and the second about electrical transmission, illustrate this.
The first bill, House Bill 25-1040, which is now law, declared that nuclear energy is clean. It proclaims that utilities can meet clean-energy targets with nuclear. It also allows private projects access to financing restricted to clean energy development.
The bill sailed through the Legislature. Gov. Jared Polis signed it into law March 31. For believers, those who want to believe that nuclear energy will be the answer, it was a big win.
To what effect? Likely none. Forget about nuclear waste and safety concerns. Cost of energy from new nuclear plans remains exorbitant.

Some of this was sorted through in a four-hour committee hearing in March. Chuck Kutscher was among several dozen individuals given two-minute slots to testify. He deserved more time. A nuclear engineer by training, he subsequently moved into renewables, retiring from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory several years ago.
At a later meeting in Jefferson County, Kutscher explained why he expects nuclear energy to play no role in Colorado’s energy transition. It comes down to cost.
“I like to give credit where credit is due. And the fact is that nuclear power in this country has saved a heck of a lot of carbon dioxide and air pollution emissions,” he said. “Nuclear provides almost half of U.S. carbon-free electricity, which is pretty impressive.”
As for costs, Kutscher cited two metrics courtesy of Lazard, a financial company that monitors electrical generation. The cost of building new nuclear plants comes in at $8,000 to $13,000 per kilowatt of generating capacity. Solar comes in at $1,400, wind at $2,000.
A broader metric, the levelized cost, includes capital, fuel and operating costs over the life of an energy plant. “The longer a plant runs, the lower its life-cycle costs, because it’s producing more energy,” Kutscher explained. By this measure, nuclear still comes up short: 18 cents a kilowatt-hour compared to solar and wind for 5 and 6 cents.
Might costs drop with a new generation of small modular reactors? SMRs can generate 300 megawatts or less. One was planned in the West, but in 2023 the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems pulled out of its contract with nuclear company NuScale — because of cost.
If nuclear costs make it a non-starter in Colorado, can renewables deliver us to an emission-free electrical system? The sun vanishes daily, and sometimes winds on our eastern plains die down, even for days. Kutscher sees possible solutions in improving storage technologies and expanded transmission. Transmission can enable electricity to be shared across multiple time zones and weather systems.
Transmission technologies
Even moving electricity around Colorado more efficiently has value. The second bill, Senate Bill 24-127, proposes to do that. It would require investor-owned utilities to investigate tools called advanced transmission technologies. They will enable more use from existing transmission lines and associated infrastructure.
Larry Milosevich, a Lafayette resident, decided six years ago to devote himself to fewer pursuits. He says he chose the role of advanced technologies for transmission because of its oversized impact.  The transmission system developed during the last century has many inefficiencies.
“I would love to see advanced transmission technologies get a little more light,” he says. Why hasn’t it happened? “It doesn’t have sex appeal.”
This bill will not solve all problems. “You need a lot of arrows in your quiver to get there. And it’s not one technology that’s going to save the day,” says Leah Rubin Shen, managing director of Advanced Energy United, an industry association that advocates for technologies and policies that advance decarbonization.
More transmission will still be needed. Approvals take time. Using these tools can more rapidly expand capacity at lower cost. “We characterize it as a no-regrets solution,” says Rubin Shen.
State Sen. Cleave Simpson, a Republican from Alamosa, was the primary author of the bill. “We can increase the capacity and resilience of our infrastructure without having to undertake expensive, large-scale construction projects,” he told committee members at a March meeting.
The committee that day heard from fewer than a dozen witnesses. It passed an amended bill and moved on within 45 minutes. Several weeks before, the same committee heard nuclear testimony for hours.
In a later interview, Simpson described the bill, slimmed greatly in ambition from its original iteration, as “maybe a tiny step forward, but a doable one.”
Unlike nuclear, not the answer, but a doable one.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The plot is thickening in the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) takeover of Providence public schools. It’s been five years. Providence wants them back ASAP. But neither side has offered ways to rebuild the foundations that cement the dysfunction.  
Until now.
Useful ideas are emerging at the State House, with increasingly specific proposals that have actual meat on nice-sounding principles. In a true act of forward movement, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 
Zurier’s bills were introduced a month after Gov. Dan McKee and RIDE outlined nine conditions the city must meet to regain local control by June 2026.
Basically, the city must provide more money, fiscal transparency, a trained and well-informed board, and improved facilities. No argument there, but where are changes to education policy per se? One condition told the city to “establish performance-based outcomes for contracts at the Providence Public School Department, such as custodial services.” Wait. Custodial contracts?!  
The nine conditions seemed tone deaf to report after report. Like the Providence Blueprint for Education, which called the school district “confused about priorities.”
Like the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy 2019 review that precipitated the takeover by documenting a laundry list of problems, from the majority of students performing below grade level to demoralized teachers and unsafe school buildings. 
Like last year’s Senate Education Commission’s report, identifying the Providence teachers contract as a huge obstacle to student success.   










Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 


RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green soon followed up with a substantial, detailed letter to the city clarifying and reducing nine conditions to five overarching concerns: Governance, Finances, Facilities, Legislation and a Transition Plan. 
Four of the concerns have numbered and bulleted details with educational asks, like requiring the school board to shift its focus from adult inputs to student outcomes — the very heart of the matter.
But “Legislation” has only a vague sentence requesting an intergovernmental team to work on state laws “to remove legislative barriers to improving outcomes and opportunities for Providence’s children.”  
While clearly anti-kid and anti-education, legislative barriers seem immutable because no one wants conflicts with our powerful teachers unions. Remember this: A public-sector teachers union is a private-sector business whose mission is to benefit and protect teachers. The laws serve adults.  
Thankfully, the trio of bills from Zurier offer a better way. Here’s how:
Senate Bill No. 745 – Expedited grievance process  
State law imposes a grievance procedure so onerous, administrators rarely try to discipline or fire a non-performing teacher. Unions argue they “counsel out” poor teachers with a stern conversation, and sometimes that does work. But teachers’ union dues entitle members to full-throated legal protection if they want it. 
Abundant stories, now too old to threaten confidentiality, include the 80-year-old who slept through classes, but whom the union protected on the grounds that the district had not supplied adequate professional development.  
The commission offers an example of the onerous process with the story of a 2014 grievance that originated with an evidence-filled termination letter to a certain teacher. After several district hearings, the grievance went to RIDE for “an appeal to a hearing officer, a review by the commissioner, a second review by the commissioner, an appeal to the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education and an appeal to the Superior Court which upheld the termination.” The Supreme Court is still an option. 
Solution: End blanket protection of all teachers no matter their performance by shortening the wealth of opportunities to appeal administrative decisions. At the same time, this bill would create guardrails to protect teachers who serve students well. The guardrails legislate against arbitrary or vengeful terminations by including a list of specific grounds for reprimand or dismissal. If the shorter appeals process doesn’t work, the matter goes to binding arbitration by specified outside parties whose decision is final. These revisions are fair to teachers and create flexibility for administration.
Senate Bill No. 746. Mandatory annual salary step increases
By law, districts and their municipalities must stick to a “a salary schedule recognizing years of service” with up to 12 annual pay increase steps. This “lock-step” pay system is a throwback to the 1960s automotive factory workers’ contracts on which our teachers’ contracts were modeled. Districts can not negotiate innovative pay systems that incentivize our best teachers to stay in the profession by, for example, advancing up the salary scale more quickly by taking on leadership roles. Conversely, teachers who need to improve get the same salary bump as everyone else.  
Solution: Eliminate the “lock-step” mandate so schools have the freedom to deploy their resources where they’re needed. The adjusted bill allows Providence to “negotiate alternative salary schedules” outside of the rigid factory-model uniformity, which may include other “bases for increased compensation” including paying “teachers willing to take on greater responsibilities.”
Senate Bill No. 747. Laying off teachers by seniority
State law mandates hiring, laying off and re-hiring teachers by seniority, which is to say, who has the oldest date of original hire. If student enrollment declines, unionized teachers must be retained or re-hired by seniority. Administrators don’t get to decide to keep the most effective educators on staff. It’s LIFO, or Last In, First Out. 
Another old story: Years ago, the district dismissed a famously popular Teacher of the Year because his three-year probation wasn’t up yet. Senior teachers who had not been rehired by a failing school that was being rebooted (“reconstituted”) had legal rights to his job. The public hew and cry made no difference. Seniority is the law. Even if contract negotiators agree to suspend strict seniority, they invite lawsuits.  
Solution: Limit LIFO, with caveats. The new bill is longer than the original 1960s-era legislation because it details what teachers might be retained regardless of seniority. They include bilingual teachers, teachers with excellent evaluations or needed skills, teachers of the year and others. For the record, teachers of color are more likely to be new, so LIFO upsets efforts to diversify the workforce. 
It’s worth noting that these bills were assigned to the Senate Labor Committee instead of the Education Committee, again prioritizing adult concerns over kids.
There’s still time, though. The legislature can still make the needed changes. If not, the dysfunctional Providence district will be a hot potato passed back and forth between the state and the city, neither of which really has the tools to succeed. 
If that happens, the Providence students will be right back where they were in 1993 when these problems were first reported. 
Remember the local cliché: “As goes Providence, so goes the state.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.

(Vlad Gavrilovic / Norfolk Transit Department)Virginia’s Department of Rail and Public Transportation has just released their draft six- year improvement program for fiscal year 2026, totaling roughly $7 billion. The funds cover both operational costs and larger sums for capital improvement projects statewide. 
The City of Alexandria, for example, will get money to help cover the $200,000  operational cost for their GO Alex program, which is the city’s outreach program to get residents to ride transit, carpool and commute by bicycle. Hampton Roads’ transportation department will receive funds towards replacing two large buses, a project that will total $1.6 million – and that’s just one of their more than 30 plus capital improvement projects. Localities depend on the state money to update the equipment used to serve the public in various regions of Virginia.
“We of course got money to buy new buses. We have a fleet of over 300 buses,” said Ray Amoruso, chief planning and development officer for Hampton Roads Transportation. “The average life of a bus is either 10 or 12 years and at some point they have to be replaced. So every year we ask for bus money.”
 How the six-year funding program works

The Six-year Improvement Program (SYIP) is an annual funding program that both DRPT and the Virginia Department of Transportation administer to help fund rail — including freight – and public transit programs across the state. The different amounts of funding found in the six-year projects is derived by formulas established by Virginia law. Individual projects, which localities apply for, are funded by the SYIP and are evaluated and given scores by DRPT, then approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. 
“The state updates their six-year improvement plan every year. So it’s like a moving window. Each year we progress,” said Amoruso. “Sometimes we ask for the same money if they didn’t award it to us [the first time]. Next year, we’ll do this all over again.”
Here’s a breakdown of how the funds will be allocated in the upcoming fiscal year:. 

Public Transportation: $332 million
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA): $442 million
Virginia Railway Express (VRE): $17 million
Rail (DRPT) $20 million
Transforming Rail in Virginia (VPRA) $232 million

Amoruso said the district gets federal operating assistance based on the size of their metropolitan area and the number of people who live in that area. The Hampton Roads Transportation District covers six cities: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
“A lot of folks who aren’t familiar with HRT or don’t use HRT think that the money they drop in the fare box pays for their ride,” he said. 
One capital project that Amoruso is excited about getting funding to build is an off-street transfer facility off Chesapeake Boulevard known as the Evelyn T. Butts Transfer Station, named after a local Civil Rights activist. Since 1999, riders have had to wait on the street to transfer buses.
“It’s not a pleasant environment. Nine routes come together and people run up and down the block along the length of the block to make connections to other routes,” said Amoruso. “It’s the third busiest transfer center we have in terms of moving human beings back in and out every day.”
 Federal funding could be in jeopardy 

Though next year’s state transportation fiscal funding is taking shape, the uncertainty of future federal support weighs heavy on Amoruso, he said. 
President Donald Trump’s administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have committed to cutting over a trillion dollars in government spending they deem wasteful, targeting scores of federal programs with special emphasis on eliminating ones supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI). A January executive order by Trump sparked panic with its directives to federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, to pause millions in federal funds disbursements, including money allotted for capital improvement projects through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and for electric vehicle and clean energy infrastructure development. 
“It’s not just us, every transit property in the country is nervous because the administration is targeting certain discretionary programs that are connected to DEI initiatives, climate change initiatives,” Amoruso said.  “We in the past have been successful in getting grant awards for low-emission, no-emission buses, meaning electric buses.”
Amoruso said HRT had a goal to convert their 300 diesel buses to a 100% hundred emissions-free, all electric bus system by 2045.
“This administration doesn’t look like they have an appetite to support those kinds of investments,” he said. “That’s just one example, but there are other programs that are at risk related to DEI and all the transit properties in the country are nervous about that and [are] watching very carefully these discretionary grants.”
One grant program Amoruso is watching is a capital investment initiative administered through Congress to help build out bus rapid transit, such as Richmond’s Pulse line or other light rail systems. 
“That’s under the microscope of the federal government right now,” said Amoruso, “which is making a lot of people nervous for high capacity transit projects.”
Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has stated to cut federal funding to Democratic-led states and cities, like New York and California, if they don’t release information on transit crime and safety funding, according E&E News by Politico. 
 Public input needed

The public is invited to comment on all the projects that have been recommended for funding in the draft six-year plan. The Commonwealth Transportation Board will host nine meetings across the state from the week of April 22 through May 15. Online comments, email or regular mail are also being accepted. 
The first meetings take place this week, starting in Richmond, followed by a meeting Wednesday in Lynchburg and one on Thursday in Hampton Roads. 
On June 17 staff from DRPT will present the draft, including any changes, to the Commonwealth Transportation Board for approval. On July 1, all the approved funding will become available.

(Ben Cunningham/ Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance.)The future of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Corridor is coming into clearer focus after the Virginia Department of Transportation recently released its highly anticipated rail with trail assessment and completed a series of related public hearings. 
In 2021, the agency completed its first study of Norfolk Southern’s 50-mile corridor, which local leaders and community organizers, who are part of the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail, hope will lead to converting the rail corridor into a trail. 
VDOT’s second corridor review comes after the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, a smaller group of community members, questioned the possibility of restoring the Manassas Gap railroad and constructing a trail alongside it. 
The rail corridor, first established in the 1850s, runs from Front Royal to the town of Broadway in Rockingham County. As interest declined in freight service, the company began discontinuing sections of the corridor in 1989, moving operations to Norfolk Southern’s Crescent Corridor, which runs east.
Kate Wofford, executive director of the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley, said her group is “eager” to convert the corridor to a trail, a goal shared by their colleagues, the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail.
“We wanted to get going with it years ago,” said Wofford. “So the sooner we can get started with this wonderful project, the sooner it will start bringing benefits to quality of life, local economic development, tourism (and) to the towns.”
Keven Walker, executive director for the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, part of the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, was asked for comment, but did not immediately respond.
The foundation is facing a lawsuit from one of its members over plans to restore the inactive Manassas Gap rail line in the Shenandoah Valley. The suit claims the foundation’s involvement strays far from its mission and threatens its federal tax-exempt status.
 The assessment

Phase 1 of the study to assess the proposal for restoring the railroad and constructing an adjacent trail details projected costs, risks, and public feedback.
While the assessment did not provide a precise total cost to taxpayers, state lawmakers stipulated that “up to $35.0 million shall be allocated to the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail for the purposes of land acquisition, initial planning, and site” development through the 2020-2022 state budget negotiation.
Some of the costs that would need to be considered are $66 million to repair the existing bridges, $4 million to $18 million to bring the rail line up to the FRA Class II standards, and funding to purchase easements and right of way and land acquisitions, given the narrow 33-foot setback from the centerline of the rail.
The study identified several unknown design factors and associated risks compared to the rail-to-trail concept, including the cantilevered trail structures on existing bridges, which would require retrofitting and may present maintenance and trail user safety concerns. 
The agency also received feedback from county administrators and town managers from 12 localities along the corridor; all of them said their communities supported the rail-to-trail proposal.
The consensus among the leaders is that business use of the rail isn’t in high demand. The study stated, “no localities indicated a strong interest from the business community for freight rail service.” 
However, the agency noted that two existing businesses, which were not identified in the study, have shown interest in using rail. Other industries, such as food processing, have indicated that rail does not fit their business model. 
Several economic development offices have received inquiries from businesses that perceive the ability to increase their customer base from trail users, the study found.
 What’s next

VDOT is currently in Phase 2 of the project to assess the corridor. The process will continue throughout the year with experts reviewing how water moves through the targeted area to inform flood prevention plans, assessing the train tracks and bridges and conducting in-person public meetings and an online public survey.
Phase 3 will conclude with a review of ownership and maintenance and a presentation of the cost estimate and assessment report, with public meetings to follow between the winter and spring of 2026.

(Courtesy Virginians For Reproductive Freedom)“Politicians shouldn’t control your body,” reads a billboard that will soon be unveiled in Central Virginia and Hampton Roads as part of a new campaign highlighting an in-progress legislative effort to enshrine reproductive health care options like abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization into Virginia’s constitution. 
These issues, longtime priorities for Democratic state lawmakers, will likely feature prominently in this year’s House of Delegates elections, where all 100 seats will be on the ballot. 
“It’s going to be in our hands, then it’s going to be in your hands,” Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said at a press conference earlier this year when touting the amendment. Boysko sponsored the amendment that would cement access to abortion care in Virginia’s code in the state Senate this year, which the legislature advanced. 
As Republican incumbents have opposed the measure, a coalition of organizations have rallied for an ad blitz spotlighting the matter. 
To support candidates who share the amendment’s goal, a cohort has emerged called Virginians For Reproductive Freedom,. The consortium includes Repro Rising Virginia, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Virginia, and Birth In Color and other organizations. It also includes Virginia’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
VRF recently announced plans for the billboards to be placed near college campuses in Hampton, Norfolk and Williamsburg and 100 sidewalk decals with similar messaging will be installed in high foot-traffic areas around Norfolk and Richmond. 
Multilingual multimedia content is planned that will break down how the constitutional amendment process works. Having passed the legislature this year, it will need to pass again next year before appearing as a referendum on ballots statewide. 
But that may only be possible if Democrats retain or grow their majority in the House of Delegates this year, as the amendment advanced this year on partisan lines. 
Virginia’s current law allows most abortions up to 26 weeks of pregnancy with limitations and approval required for the procedure to take place later. Many state Republicans have consistently opposed the current law, with some seeking to reduce the limit to 15 weeks, and others having supported near-total bans. This year, Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, introduced a bill that would have specifically protected abortion as a treatment for nonviable pregnancies, but it was never docketed or put up for a vote.
Republican abortion bill banned from Virginia’s 2025 legislative session

“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she told The Mercury at the time. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Abortions at or after 21 weeks are rare, making up just 1% of cases nationwide.  When they do occur, it’s often due to severe fetal anomalies that aren’t detected earlier through testing or because of life-threatening complications later in pregnancy. 
If Virginia’s constitution were amended, the three-physician approval threshold for later-stage abortions would be reduced to one. 
Earlier this year, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah called the resolution a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions” of the amendment. He argued that reducing the current requirement for three doctors to sign off on a procedure to just one would lower safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” Gilbert said. 
But supporters of the amendment have stressed that it could be particularly critical in rural pregnancy health crises, where patients already have to travel further for care. 
If enshrined in Virginia’s constitution, abortion access and other reproductive rights would become far more resistant to legislative shifts, shielding from the kind of partisan turnover that has shaped abortion laws in other states. But constitutional amendments are hard to undo — and equally hard to pass.
With the resolutions now clearing the legislature for the first time, the real test comes next year, when lawmakers will have to approve them again before voters get the final say at the ballot box.

There are many shortcomings in the new proposed state budget approved by the North Carolina Senate last week – the inadequate pay raises for teachers and state employees, the failure to invest in numerous core public services that have been reeling from staffing shortages, the giveaways to unaccountable special interests.
But if there’s an overarching flaw that lies at the heart of the proposal, it is the plan to plow ahead with new and regressive tax cuts at a time when state economists are warning of significant budget shortfalls in the near future.
Republican Senate leader Phil Berger – a smalltown lawyer with no credentials in economics – says the consensus forecast of the state’s economists is wrong. He claims the state’s fiscal picture will remain rosy even with new corporate and personal income tax cuts taking effect and massive new reductions in federal aid from the Trump administration.
It’s a remarkably oblivious stance.
The bottom line: North Carolina public services are already running on a shoestring and the Senate’s decision to pull that string even tighter is a huge mistake.

Maggie Hassan (left) speaks with substance use disorder treatment specialists at Elliot Health System during an event in Manchester on April 14 about how Medicaid cuts would affect their work. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Abby L’Heureux, a physician and addiction specialist at the Center for Recovery Management in Manchester, is already worried about some of her patients who have lost Medicaid coverage. Now, as Republicans in Washington, D.C., make massive cuts to the federal budget — which experts say will most likely impact Medicaid — she and her colleagues could see even more of their patients lose coverage for the care they need.
At an event organized by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan and Elliot Health System in Manchester earlier this month, L’Heureux told the story of a 30-year-old man who started using cocaine, alcohol, and opioids as a teenager and was incarcerated for the first time at 13. She said he has an extensive family history of substance use disorder as his mother died during an overdose and all his parents and grandparents have been incarcerated. On top of that, he has a seizure disorder and was homeless when he first began treatment with the center. While he hasn’t yet achieved stable long term sobriety, she said they were beginning to see success when they got him on a medication regime that includes an injectable.
“He’s just been doing so well and we continue to have little slips here and there, and we’re working on things, but he keeps coming,” she said. “And that’s a win for us, that he keeps showing up, and he keeps trying. And we always have hope that it’s just one step closer to his goal. His goal is abstinence and so, and we’re just gonna keep walking with him, one step closer, one step closer, and we’re gonna have setbacks, and that’s just a part of the process. But, he’s been doing so well, so much better, now that we’ve got him on a medication that works for him.”
L’Heureux said he’s feeling so well that he’s begun working full time again because he “just functions much better when he’s working full time, and really has things to do during the day.” However, this came with a drawback. He just lost the Medicaid coverage he uses to pay for the treatment because he’s now making too much money. She said his injectable alone costs $2,000 monthly without insurance and he has 10 different medications. She said they worry about how the Medicaid change will impact his progress, though he’s worked with a peer support coordinator to find marketplace insurance.
“That’s one of the things that we have to continue to focus on,” Hassan added. “Somebody is getting well enough to work, which is the goal — one of the goals — and then, but we don’t want them to lose insurance in the process. We want them to be able to keep coming here.”
Conversely, L’Heureux spoke of a 37-year-old man who started using cocaine at age 13, opioids at 15, and crystal meth at 22. He began working with her at the Center for Recovery Management and is taking 16 milligrams of a combination product of multiple opioid use medications. Now, he’s been sober since August 2023 and has become an advocate for his peers who speaks at commitment meetings and runs his own sober living facility. She said he even saved somebody from an overdose recently using the emergency medication Narcan. He is still able to use Medicaid for his treatments, which she said has been huge in his recovery.
The April 14 meeting came amid growing fears that Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low income or high needs, could be heavily scaled down in the federal budgeting process. On April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve legislation outlining the federal budget. That outline, which was passed 216-214 entirely through Republican support, calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which has long been lambasted by the left and economists as disproportionately benefitting the wealthy — to be renewed.
The outline instructs several committees to make varying levels of cuts to different areas of the budget. That includes the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been tasked with cutting its portion of the budget by $880 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t explicitly specify that these cuts must come from Medicaid, but because the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the $8.6 trillion the committee can cut from, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of cutting Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, including Hassan, estimate that roughly 24 million people would lose their health care coverage if this one-third cut went into effect, 10 million of whom would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children.
Almost 1 million people receive medication treatment for opioid use disorder through Medicaid, according to committee Democrats. Nearly 10,000 of them live in New Hampshire. Of those 10,000, an estimated 70% or more are able to do so only through the Medicaid expansion, which New Hampshire enacted in 2014.
That expansion program is at perhaps the greatest risk in potential Medicaid cuts. This is because in 2018, New Hampshire state legislators (Medicaid is operated and funded jointly by the federal government and states) passed a trigger law which would eliminate that expansion should federal funding for the program fall below 90% of the cost of the program. This would mean an estimated 7,000 New Hampshire residents receiving opioid treatment medication through Medicaid would lose access to it.
At this month’s event, health care providers emphasized that funding substance use disorder treatment doesn’t just help people deal with their drug issues, it also prevents those issues from turning into more costly issues later on.
“People who are not in treatment end up in medical care,” Greg Baxter, president and CEO of Elliot Health System, said.
Meanwhile, fentanyl, a dangerous type of opioid drug, is ravaging communities across the U.S., including New Hampshire. Additionally, New Hampshire was among the hardest hit states in the opioid epidemic that began in the 2010s. From August 2022 to August 2023, over 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses or poisonings, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. In New Hampshire alone, there were 483 drug overdose deaths in 2022, the most recent data available, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. That’s 36 per 100,000 Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hassansubstance-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”











I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity



In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

LINCOLN — An assessment of restoring the historic Mayhew Cabin and John Brown’s Cave site in Nebraska City estimates it would cost in excess of $20 million to make it a viable attraction again.
Most of the cost, the report indicated, would be demolishing several of the seven existing structures on the site, which have been damaged by flooding and neglect.
Building a new museum to interpret the cabin, a site used by escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, would cost $3 million alone, according to the assessment by the architectural firm, Clark & Enerson.
Back to Square One?
Cathleen Van Winkle, the president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex, said she was not surprised by the expensive repair estimate, given the extensive damage caused by flooding in 2019 and 2013.
Van Winkle, in an email on Friday, said that the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which paid for the assessment, has told the Foundation that there is “little likelihood” that the Nebraska Legislature will appropriate money to rebuild the museum due to state budget shortfalls.
Still, she said, she’s hopeful something might be done during the current legislative session.

“If funding fails, the Foundation will have no choice but to go back to square one to begin looking for other partners and alternative plans to save the cabin and its rich history,” Van Winkle said.
Another member of the Foundation board, Robert Nelson, an Underground Railroad historian and former columnist with the Omaha World-Herald, said he’s hopeful the cabin can be saved and become part of a historic byway being developed along the “Lane Trail.” That is a Civil War-era pathway from Iowa to Kansas used by escaping slaves as well as Abolitionists — including John Brown — seeking to join the fight against pro-slavery forces in Kansas.
“We’ll do anything to save the (Mayhew) cabin,” Nelson said in an interview. “We’d love it to be as close as possible to this trail.”
Unsuccessful lawsuit
The Mayhew Cabin, which is listed on the National Park Service Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, has been closed since the 2019 flooding. The flooding prompted the Mayhew Foundation to sue unsuccessfully the City of Nebraska City, claiming it was negligent for allowing runoff from the nearby ravine to damage the site and its structures.
Other calamities have damaged the site, including a 2013 flood, a large tree that fell atop a church on the property, and a series of sewage backups at a museum structure, which has a sinking foundation. The museum also has seen two break-ins in recent years.

– Cathleen Van Winkle, president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex


The recent study indicated that the underground tunnel — a “cave” that a Mayhew family member has said was used to store potatoes, not by escaping slaves — was deemed unstable and in need of replacement.
Replacement was also recommended for the museum, which the engineers estimated would cost $100,000 to demolish and $3 million for a new museum.
Also recommended to be demolished and replaced were a railroad depot, a church and a picnic shelter on the property, which are all owned by the Foundation.
Due to a lack of funds, the Foundation has been unable to make any repairs since the site was closed in 2019. In 2023, the Foundation signed a letter of intent to donate the site to the Game and Parks Commission, which led to the site assessment.
Fans have other ideas
Some fans of the Mayhew Cabin site have other ideas. That includes a Peru State professor, Sara Crook, who does historical portrayals of the older sister of John Kagi, an abolitionist who brought escaped slaves to the cabin and was a friend of John Brown.
Crook, who is on the state Hall of Fame Commission, said that in her opinion, only the Mayhew Cabin needs to be saved and preserved, which would reduce the cost of restoring the site substantially.
In an email to the Examiner, Jim Swenson, the assistant director of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said that after meeting with the Mayhew Foundation board this week “there may be revisions in scope to reduce the cost.”
Crook also said that the Nebraska State Historical Society would be a more appropriate agency to lead the restoration, rather than the Game and Parks Commission.
Whether the cabin should remain where it is, in a flood-prone location, or moved elsewhere in Nebraska City or Lincoln or another community, is another question.
The site assessment recommended that the cabin — which was moved from its original site due to the widening of an adjacent highway — be relocated onto a more stable foundation.



Spotlight shifts to Mayhews, John Kagi
John Brown’s Cave has served as a tourist attraction since the 1930s. But over the years, the focus of the site has shifted from the cave and any connection to the famed abolitionist John Brown, to the role of the Mayhew family and of one of its relatives, John Kagi.
Kagi, who lived several months at the Mayhew Cabin, helped slaves escape northward from nearby slave states, like Missouri, to reach freedom. He was second in command to Brown during the failed raid on Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, on Oct. 17, 1859. Kagi was killed during the raid.
Four years earlier, Kagi had lived with his sister Barbara Mayhew and her husband, Allen, at a Mayhew Cabin.
A 2002 article for the Nebraska State Historical Society’s magazine stated that Kagi had once brought 14 escaped slaves to the Nebraska City cabin, who, after eating breakfast, continued on foot northward.
A letter from Edward Mayhew, Barbara and Allen’s son, refuted earlier newspaper accounts that Brown himself had guided escaped slaves to freedom through a tunnel underneath the Mayhew cabin. The son said the cave was dug for storing potatoes, that slaves never used it and that John Brown never visited it.
The cabin was moved to its current location in 1937 to accommodate the construction of Highway 2, which has since been relocated to the south edge of Nebraska City. The tunnel beneath the cabin was dug in hopes of attracting tourists, according to a 2014 article evaluating sites on the Underground Railroad.

More than 1.7 million Michiganders live with a mental illness, yet fewer than two-thirds are getting treatment. The result is felt across emergency rooms, homeless shelters, courtrooms, and schools—places never designed to provide long-term care but now functioning as last resort.
Behind this growing crisis is a system struggling to meet the demand. Providers are overwhelmed. Psychologists, social workers, case managers, and peer specialists are stretched thin and forced to focus on administrative paperwork rather than patient care. Michiganders in all 83 counties are trying to get the care they need in their communities.
Michigan’s behavioral health system is built on a structure it can no longer support. It is fragmented, hard to navigate, and often unfair to the organizations trying to keep it together.
As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) considers rebidding its behavioral health contracts, the state has a rare opportunity to rebuild a system that is more responsive, accountable, and equitable for everyone.
When people get into the community mental health system, they succeed.
Michigan’s community-based behavioral health system was created to keep people out of institutions and help them thrive in their communities. And when it works, it works well.
But getting into the system—and staying connected to care—isn’t easy.
One of the biggest hurdles is how services are managed and paid for. Michigan’s system is built around 10 regional Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs), which manage Medicaid behavioral health funding. In some regions, those PIHPs are also Community Mental Health Service Programs (CMHSPs), the entities that provide or contract services in the community. Services they can’t offer are given to community-based service providers.
The result is a model in which a single organization often acts as both the funder and the provider of care. This creates deep conflicts of interest, with serious consequences.
When your funder is your competitor, the playing field isn’t level.
Many safety net providers across the state, including those providing mental health services and substance use disorder (SUD) services, are nonprofits and are disadvantaged by the current system of care when their funder is also their competitor. There needs to be a way to create fair competition.
Under the current system, these safety net providers face lower reimbursement rates, lose staff to higher-paying public entities, and often compete for funding from the agencies delivering services themselves.
There’s also the issue of fairness. When the same entity sets the rules, delivers care, and controls the money, there’s little incentive for transparency—or accountability. Rate structures may favor internal programs. Disputes can go unresolved. And smaller, independent providers often operate without the same access to data or decision-making power.
This imbalance doesn’t just hurt organizations—it directly affects access to care. Gaps in funding and staffing mean more waitlists, fewer options, and higher barriers for people trying to get help. In a crisis, those delays can mean the difference between recovery and relapse, between housing and homelessness, or between safety and incarceration.
Administrative barriers drain time and resources.
 Despite shared goals to improve outcomes and ensure transparency, the current model often leads to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Each PIHP can impose its compliance systems, audits, and data reporting protocols. For organizations working across regions, this leads to duplication of effort and a mounting administrative load that does little to improve care quality.
Even within the same state contract framework, the interpretation and application of rules vary widely. Providers suggest aligning administrative requirements with the state’s master contract and streamlining oversight functions could significantly reduce the burden and help stabilize an already stretched workforce.
There is a path forward.
Michigan’s 2026 budget includes funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), higher Medicaid reimbursement rates, and workforce development. But without structural reform, those investments will fall short.
CCBHCs offer a promising model—comprehensive, no-wrong-door care that meets people where they are. However, to fulfill their promise, Michigan must ensure these clinics are accessible to experienced nonprofit providers and protected from the same funding conflicts already plaguing the system.
What’s needed now is clarity and separation of roles. Funders should not be service providers. Oversight should be independent. Every provider—regardless of affiliation—should have a fair shot at delivering care and competing for talent and services.
Why it matters.
Behavioral health reform isn’t just about systems—it’s about outcomes. When people don’t get the care they need, communities absorb the cost. Hospitals fill up. Jails become de facto treatment centers. Families lose hope. And too many Michiganders end up unhoused, unemployed, or worse.
But when the system works—when it’s fair, transparent, and community-based—it saves lives, keeps people out of crisis, and supports recovery, stability, and dignity.
The opportunity before Michigan is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about building a system that works for the future—one where every person, regardless of diagnosis or zip code, can access the behavioral health care they need to live a full life.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/behavioral-therapy-mental-health-GettyImages-1140393669-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

A larger-than-expected crowd went to the Ohio capitol on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump and the many controversial actions of his young administration. It was one of at least 47 across Ohio and more than 700 across the United States.
Columbus police said that the crowd appeared to approach 3,000. That was smaller than the roughly 5,000 who turned out on April 5, when millions protested nationwide. But with the Easter holiday and fewer sponsoring organizations, smaller crowds were expected on Saturday.
Large crowds also gathered in Cincinnati, rainy Akron, and other cities across the Buckeye State. They were sponsored by the group 50501.

Organizers chose April 19 to protest in part for its symbolic value. On that day in 1775, the first battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in Lexington and Concord, Mass.
Playing off of that theme, many carried signs Saturday denouncing Trump and accusing him of trying to be a king. 
Trump has been raising such concerns in several ways. They include by trying to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, and by empowering the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the National Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
But perhaps more concerning is that his administration has been invoking a law not used in 80 years, accusing some migrants of membership in gangs, and deporting them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. He has defied court orders — including one to bring back a man whom the administration admitted was deported in error.
The U.S. Supreme Court early Saturday morning ordered a temporary halt to the deportations. So the stage seems to be setting for a confrontation between the judiciary — which has no army to enforce its orders — and an executive who sometimes has been disinclined to heed them.
That was on the minds of many at the Columbus protest. Chuck Ardo of Lancaster said that his family migrated to the United States from Slovakia when he was a child, and that his parents survived the Holocaust.
“Fascism is something I’ve always been aware of,” he said. “Due process and the Constitution, that’s what matters. I don’t know if these people are deportable or not. But they all deserve due process and that’s what’s missing here. They’ve labeled them ‘terrorists,’ but on what grounds? What proof have they shown?”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., last week visited the wrongly deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, at the Salvadorean prison. He said that if Trump has evidence that Abrego Garcia is in a gang, he needs to present it court — not just claim it on social media.
For Ardo, Trump’s actions have a disturbing historical echo.
“Donald Trump is doing many of the things Hitler did as he rose to power,” he said. “Hitler attacked the courts. He attacked the universities. I’m not accusing anybody of being a Nazi here, but while history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
Debbie Wood of Powell said the president has been acting like a king in other ways as well.
“Trump did not win in a landslide,” she said. “More people voted for someone else than for him. He does not have a mandate. Even the people who voted for him did not vote to ruin the VA. They didn’t vote to fire people who do cancer research. They didn’t vote to take food out of the mouths of hungry people. Ruining the national parks. Nobody voted for any of that stuff.”
She added, “People are getting more and more angry. He’s sending people away to concentration camps without due process. Ignoring court orders. Who does that? We would be in jail.”

Gary Bennett of St. Clairsville stood at the base of a monument to former President William McKinley holding a sign that mocked Trump and slammed him for gutting the staff at the National Park Service. He said that’s just one problem among many he has with the new administration.
“We could make signs every day of the week and there would still be signs to make,” he said. “Me and my wife just retired, and we don’t want him to take away our Social Security. That’s just one thing.”
Chris Glass of Delaware said she’s also upset about many things Trump is doing, and that protesting helps.
“There is something very nice about the camaraderie,” she said. “It’s a sense that people do care. I think we represent the country better than our current government does.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250419_124710-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Getty Images.A recent report from an Ohio-based health institute emphasizes the importance of prevention and testing after decades of study and treatment on HIV, calling it a “pressing public health concern in the United States” as the Trump administration proposes eliminating research and programs on the disease.
According to the Equitas Health Institute’s study on HIV research, the pressing public health concern is being faced by young adults the most, with the age group ranging from the early teens to early 30s accounting for 58% of the estimated 32,100 new HIV diagnoses in 2021.
The importance of sex education and awareness of HIV status is always important, researchers said, but in the current political climate, “HIV is often caught in the crossfire of health care debates and shifting policies.”
“Access to funding resources, education and prevention programs is inconsistent and, in many areas, highly inadequate,” the study found. “Navigating sexual health is about building resilience and showing young adults that they are not defined by a diagnosis, the politics surrounding sexual health, or the uncertainty of living with HIV.”
The study comes as the Trump Administration sets its sights on HIV research as part of vast funding cuts within the federal government. Funding is already gone for HIV-related research grants within the National Institutes of Health, including research at U.S. universities and international efforts.
Of the terminated grants, two went to the Ohio State University for studies on “the influence of developmental assets on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention in Black (men who have sex with men)” and a study on “client and clinician priorities” regarding two HIV prevention medications.
Cuts to research and funding
But more chops may be coming as the Trump administration plans to restructure the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services could include elimination of federal HIV prevention and research programs. Those cuts could include the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative, a government move that aimed to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030.
The initiative was started under the previous Trump administration, but the CDC web page on the initiative now mentions a court order requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to restore the website as of Feb. 14. Text at the top of the page then claims any information on the page “promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
“The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children,” the page now states, adding that it “does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this department rejects it.”
HIV is a disease that attacks the immune system by going after white blood cells, which can develop into the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Symptoms don’t always present with HIV, so testing is necessary to identify it, according to Equitas Health.
AIDS wasn’t formally identified in the U.S. until the 1980s, and even then, researchers said governmental response was “minimal,” and then-President Ronald Reagan wouldn’t use the term until 1985.
Community response came in the form of a grassroots effort called ACT UP in 1987, and in 1990, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program was established for low-income individuals living with HIV, an organization that exists to this day, currently housed under the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration. The Ohio Department of Health still houses a Ryan White Part B Program for HIV-related services, funded through federal grants, according to the state.
The first treatment method for AIDS was approved in 1996, and cases of the disease began decreasing after the first antiretroviral therapy was released, addressing a disease that was then the leading cause of death for all American adults ages 25-44.
Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic was connected to gay men from the moment it was officially identified, data from the early 1990s showed the disease was present in other groups, including members of various genders, sexualities, races, socio-economic levels and health statuses, according to Equitas Health.
Prevention efforts were started at the local and state public health level, as well as in partnerships between the CDC and national minority organizations.
Testing is an “essential component of HIV prevention, treatment and care,” according to the report, and a lack of awareness about the illness “contributes to the spread of HIV, as individuals who are unaware of their infection statues are more likely to engage in behaviors that can transmit the virus to others.”
“Barriers to testing include stigma, lack of awareness and limited access to testing services,” the report stated. “Stigma may occur within the patient, their community or health care providers.”
Ohio law effective since 2012 requires the Ohio Department of Health to develop and administer AIDS and HIV-related programs, including a system to determine the number of cases, development of counseling and testing programs, risk reduction/education programs to at-risk groups and pilot programs for long-term care.
A treatment now exists to prevent HIV transmission, and the FDA approved the first HIV home-testing kit in 2012, with the CDC funding nearly 2 million tests per year, according to 2021 data.
“Despite medications improving lives and reducing transmission, there is still no cure for the disease,” researchers at Equitas Health stated. “There are two objectives in HIV research: sustained viral suppression without medication and total eradication of the virus.”
Even with improved treatment and testing, HIV rates began to increase during the 2010s, researchers stated, pointing to young adults as a disproportionately affected group.
Sex education
A lack of required sex education also has impacts, according to the report. Sex education in Ohio has been seen as lacking in many ways, with advocates for sex education increasing the push for requirements after Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the 1970s was overturned, and the discussion of reproductive rights and sexual health was put to individual states.
Ohio law regarding education curricula including sex education has been changed numerous times over the years, with the most recent change enacted in October 2024. That change came via the Republican-led Senate Bill 168, which, among other education-related changes, amended references in Ohio law from “venereal disease” education to “sexually transmitted infection” education.
A bill passed last year was harshly criticized for forcing school districts to notify parents if a child identifies as LGBTQ+ and allowing parents to opt out of “sexuality content.” During the committee process in the Senate, however, an amendment was added to the bill to specify that content the bill deemed objectionable was not targeting STI education.
While STI education is in Ohio law, advocates for more sexual education say abstinence-focused instruction and the other provisions currently in law aren’t enough.
The non-profit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States said Ohio’s sex education curriculum”is not required to be comprehensive, medically accurate or include instruction on topics such as consent, sexual orientation or gender identity, or contraceptive options.”
“This leaves local school districts to decide what sex education curriculum they provide,” the group stated.
The research from Equitas Health recognized the resilience of young adults, despite being a population that is understudied among HIV study.
“Young adults with marginalized identities require diverse and targeted approaches within HIV care,” the report concluded. “However, adults within sexual, gender and racial minority groups are often excluded from HIV discourse. The unique needs of young adults must be considered.”

(Photo courtesy of Maria Wilkinson)In 2015, just four months after graduating from Concord High, I arrived in California to begin a year of service to my country. Not through the military or college, but through AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) — a program that would change my life in ways I never expected.
On our first day, we were told: “You’re not here to help others — you’re here for yourselves.” At first, that felt selfish. But over the next 10 months, I came to understand what that meant. Yes, we were serving others — but through that service, we were also learning, growing, and transforming ourselves.
I was assigned to the West Coast campus and placed on a team with 11 other young people from all across the country. We lived together, cooked together, worked out together — and most importantly, we served together.
In Montana, we helped build homes with Habitat for Humanity. In California, we spent months clearing brush to reduce wildfire risk. In Utah, we served as camp counselors for individuals with disabilities. On weekends, we volunteered in local communities — cooking Sunday breakfasts at churches, planting trees to prevent erosion, cleaning up community gardens.
We lived on less than $200 a month. We didn’t join AmeriCorps for the money — we joined because we wanted to be part of something bigger than ourselves. I wasn’t ready for college right out of high school. I needed to see more of the world first. AmeriCorps NCCC gave me that chance.
This program taught me what it really means to serve my country — not just through military service or government jobs, but through compassion, manual labor, teamwork, and meeting people where they are.
That’s why it’s devastating to see AmeriCorps NCCC being defunded and dismantled. Doing so doesn’t just take away a year of service — it takes away a path of purpose, growth, and opportunity for thousands of young Americans.
Cutting AmeriCorps NCCC isn’t a budgetary win. It’s a national loss.
To the young people who won’t be able to finish their year of service, and to those who will never get the chance to start: I’m sorry. You deserve this opportunity. And our country needs programs like this more than ever.

I will bring Americans together to strengthen our communities.

It will be welcomed. … We’re going to make sure that all the work we’ve done doesn’t go to waste because it’s being ignored. We’re going to make sure it happens and nothing speaks like money.”

The new law will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
Cirino introduced S.B. 1 earlier this year which quickly passed the Ohio Senate and House. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law at the end of March and it will take effect on June 27. Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
“Opponents of Senate Bill 1 have said it will destroy higher education in Ohio,” Cirino said. “Well, the governor signed the bill a couple of weeks ago, and to my knowledge, higher education is still pretty well intact in the state of Ohio.” 
More than 1,500 people testified against S.B. 1 — including many college students, faculty and staff who said they would leave Ohio if this bill became law. 
“Certainly for some of them that would be OK,” Cirino said. “Some of the ones who came to testify, I will help them pack.” 
The Ohio Capital Journal recently talked to a Cleveland State University student who is transferring to a New York university after spring semester because of the new law. 
Cirino talked about the need for a higher education law like this given “the predominance of left-leaning faculty, which has skewed things on our campuses.”
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said. “If our universities and community colleges are fixated on DEI, separating students by race and hiring professors who follow a monolithic liberal agenda, we are not preparing our students to learn how to analyze research and come to their own conclusions.”
Cirino said the new law creates more opportunities for speech, reiterated that it’s not anti-union and makes education available to everyone. 
“Some of our universities have been spending tens of millions of dollars on infrastructure for DEI which has become institutional discrimination,” he said. “You can’t solve discrimination by having other discrimination. The best way to eliminate discrimination is to eliminate discrimination.”
The new law also bans faculty strikes, something Cirino said is a student rights issue, not a labor issue. 
“When a student signs up for a semester and pays for it, that’s a contract between them and the university,” he said. “Nothing should interrupt that. Nothing at all.”
Even though the law only applies to Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, private colleges would be required to comply with parts of S.B.1 if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, according to language from the House’s version of the budget. The budget is now in the hands of the Senate where Cirino is the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia, and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Ron Estes (second from right) poses with other U.S. representatives during a trip to El Salvador last week. (U.S. Embassy in El Salvador)We do not elect kings in Kansas or the United States.
We do not dole out justice through lynch mobs or popularity contests either.
Yet there U.S. Rep. Ron Estes stood in a picture from the U.S. embassy in El Salvador, lending tacit approval to a mob that has all but condemned Maryland father Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to death, at the behest of a would-be tyrant in Washington, D.C.
The facts of the case are simple and damning. Garcia was sent to a gulag without due proxies of law, and President Donald Trump’s administration has defied a 9-0 Supreme Court order in keeping him there. The White House has attempted to smear the man in absentia, with all the crudeness of those who used to accuse Black boys of taking liberties with white women.
This, apparently, is fine and dandy with Estes.

On Tuesday, Republican Reps. Jason Smith of Missouri and Riley Moore of West Virginia posed proudly in pictures from CECOT — the notorious El Salvadoran mega-prison where the United States has shipped hundreds without due process. Estes did not post such pictures. However, the 4th District congressman stood in a lineup with Smith and Moore in an image posted Wednesday by the embassy, along with Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Mike Kennedy of Utah, Carol Miller of West Virginia and Claudia Tenney of New York.
Credit must go at this point to independent journalist and Kansas Reflector friend Marisa Kabas, who first reported about the Republicans’ visit. She reached out to the lawmakers for comment, hearing back only from Hearn’s office: “We cannot confirm or comment on the Congressman’s location for security purposes.” Tenney subsequently tweeted that she had also toured CECOT.
I reached out via email to Estes spokesman Roman Rodriguez to ask whether the representative had gone to the prison or was concerned about Garcia’s welfare. He did not respond.

Prison pipeline
We cannot close our eyes to the brutal reality of CECOT or El Salvador’s government.
According to Ana Piquer, Americas director at Amnesty International: “El Salvador is implementing a systematic state policy of massive and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. After three years, more than 85,000 individuals remain behind bars without sufficient admissible evidence, the victims of a judicial system now transformed into a tool for collective punishment and widespread repression. Attempts to export this policy to the situation of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the United States highlights the lack of protection and the risk that hundreds of thousands of people now face of having their human rights violated by not one, not two, but three different states.”
You can’t confuse this gulag with any kind of American facility. In our country, attorneys and law enforcement must still abide by the law. Not in El Salvador. Conditions there go beyond mere cruelty.
Officials have decided to create a concentration camp, one in which prisoners are denied due process and tortured.
In the words of Human Rights Watch: “People held in CECOT, as well as in other prisons in El Salvador, are denied communication with their relatives and lawyers, and only appear before courts in online hearings, often in groups of several hundred detainees at the same time. The Salvadoran government has described people held in CECOT as ‘terrorists,’ and has said that they ‘will never leave.’ Human Rights Watch is not aware of any detainees who have been released from that prison.”
Juanita Goebertus Estrada, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said that while the mega-prison was built more recently than other facilities in the country, he understands that conditions are similar to other prisons in the country.
“This includes cases of torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare and food,” he said.
No one should go to such a facility. Not even the most notorious criminals, of any country or any citizenship status. No one.

Trump temper tantrum
Regardless of pushback from courts at every level, President Donald Trump has persisted in his quest to send immigrants out of this country and to the most brutal and dehumanizing conditions.
No matter their ideology or party, our elected officials must step up and speak out against such authoritarian violence. Estes, during his visit to El Salvador, had every opportunity to do so. He could have joined Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen in meeting with Garcia and urging his immediate release from detention. He could have spoken up for the rule of law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as codified by the United Nations.
Instead, he posed for the picture and made no public comment. He lent his silent assent to a governmental lynching.
Garcia may have been a gang member. He may have beaten his wife. He may have leaked the COVID-19 virus from a lab and caused Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis to bomb at the box office. Any or all of these stories may be true. But he has been convicted of none of them. If the Trump administration actually believes such accusations against Garcia, bring him back and criminally charge him.
Due process of law means due process for everyone, citizens and noncitizens alike. Respect for the rule of law means respecting all court decisions, even those with which you disagree. Without following these precepts, our democratic society crumbles. You support the ruthless mob, willing to hang a man on mere suspicion.
Estes might be OK with that. On his website, he touts support for a bill that would strip power from judges. The same figures tasked with defending the rights of everyone.
Perhaps he has decided to declare fealty to a king rather than support a mere president.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Nebraska’s 13 private colleges and universities might do well to keep an eye on Harvard University’s recent resounding “no” to the president who wants the feds to have a say in the school’s inner workings, including teaching and hiring. 
Harvard’s hard pass meant the federal government froze $2.2 billion earmarked for the nation’s most recognizable university, primarily for scientific and medical research including work in artificial intelligence, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s — areas in which Harvard is recognized as a leader. As of this writing, the president is also threatening to yank the school’s tax exempt status, something he can’t do unilaterally.
What the White House wants is essentially a measure of control at Harvard. It has dressed that demand as a worthy cause: the elimination of antisemitism on campus. In a letter to the Cambridge university, the government accused Harvard of not having the correct “intellectual and civil rights conditions” to allow further federal funds to make their way to the famed campus. 
The letter also demanded that the college name names by reporting to the feds students “who are ‘hostile’ to American values” and require — without explanation — academic departments to be something called “viewpoint diverse” and hire government-approved auditors to see if any programs, policies or departments “fuel antisemitic harassment.”
Harvard stands firm
Whew! And that was only part of the ultimatum. Finding the directives out of line with the mission of the university, Harvard stood firm. The university’s president said, “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach. … The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
Most of Harvard’s massive endowment is earmarked for specific projects. Even so perhaps more than any other private school in the nation, it is financially equipped to meet the challenge of such defunding. Surely, a Creighton or a Midland or a Concordia would have to meet such pressure in another way.
Harvard is one of nearly 60 colleges and universities under scrutiny by the federal government for practices the government alleges might contribute to anti-semitism. Efforts to curb that distemper are smart and justified when and where they are needed. Indeed, some of the five dozen colleges and universities, including Harvard, have made changes toward protecting Jewish students who feel threatened on campus. 
While none of Nebraska’s private colleges and universities made the list, the University of Nebraska at Omaha was notified by the Trump administration last month that it was under investigation for “race exclusionary practices” having to do with the awarding of scholarships to graduate students. UNO had closed its DEI office in February. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln closed its DEI office in August 2024. Even so, a bill in the Nebraska Legislature to outlaw any office of diversity, equity and inclusion on any public college campus in the state hasn’t gained much traction to date.
Part of broader battle
The battle for the soul of post-secondary education, however, is old news. Many on the right see colleges as breeding grounds for what they see as the scourge of “woke” culture, a pedagogical petri dish growing an array of evil anagrams from DEI to CRT to ESG. Campus protests over Gaza since late 2023 have stoked these culture war fires. Two years earlier, eventual vice-president J.D. Vance famously said, “the universities are the enemy.”  
I spent four years as a member of the adjunct faculty and part of the academic support staff at Hastings College, a small private institution in south-central Nebraska. “HC” is a beautiful campus, not unlike a New England setting, nestled in a neighborhood just north and east of downtown Hastings. 
Hastings College is obviously not Harvard, nor is it a big public system such as the University of Nebraska. The task there, however, was similar: train young minds to think critically, research thoroughly and act decisively on the outcome of each. I’m also happy to say that I saw diversity, equity and inclusion — intentional and otherwise — fostered and celebrated. 
The mission of a college is a goal, not always the exact outcome. And individual college experiences don’t always live up to expectations. But when campuses are diverse, vibrant and vital places, when they challenge students and faculty to be the best versions of themselves, when they get it right, when the lights brighten, the research adds up and the solutions solve problems, the rest of the world is better for it … whether it’s Harvard University or Hastings College. 
Hardly enemies of the American people and no place for the feds to interfere.

Photo submitted by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. Photo submitted by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperRoutine water sampling conducted by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper as part of a federal partnership revealed alarming levels of bacteria discharged into the river by Fulton County’s largest wastewater treatment plant in 2023.
The Georgia Environmental Protection Division issued several violations and a $300,000 fine against the city of Atlanta for maintenance problems causing numerous illegal discharges of pollution at the RM Clayton Water Reclamation Facility in northwest Atlanta.
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Chris Manganiello considers the Fulton County pollution drama as a reason to sound the alarm over the now-uncertain future of the U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross.
The center’s lease recently appeared on the Elon Musk-led U.S. Department of Government Efficiency’s list for possible terminations by the end of 2025, but it’s still unclear what that means for the staff and the program’s mission.
The U.S. General Services Administration, which manages federal property, did not respond to the Recorder’s emailed questions about the terms of the lease and the fate of the staff.
Since the early 2000s, the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper and the federal agency have collaborated on the BacteriALERT program that provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in a river that is a source of drinking water for millions of Georgians.
“Eventually after working with Fulton County, they came to an agreement with us that their plant was not functioning,” Manganiello said. “This is a situation where we’re pretty sure that we wouldn’t have identified this problem without the help of collection from USGS sources.”
Environmentalists and Democratic congressional members are expressing concerns about the planned lease termination, which the DOGE website says will save the federal government more than $1.3 million.
The center is one of more than a dozen government offices in Georgia that could have its leases ended under the Trump administration’s cuts.
Riverkeeper members said that water gauges are essential for maintaining compliance with state and federal permits. The data collected by these gauges tracks flood levels and the National Weather Service contracts with the center to collect rainfall data.
Manganiello, the Riverkeeper water policy director, said that the closure of the Norcross office and potential layoffs could at a minimum disrupt water monitoring for several months, which could lead to a significant decline in water quality and compliance.
“It’s one thing if we all knew they’re going to close this office because they moved into another location, that would be okay,” he said. “But because we don’t know what’s going to happen if the lease is terminated and these people don’t have a place to physically work, that means there’s going to be a disruption in the maintenance of the physical equipment and to data collection and data processing.”
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said the center operates water flow gauges essential for monitoring everything from bacteria to water flooding levels impacting water management in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
“This science center is critical for many reasons, including the fact that they run all of the flow gauges for Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina,” Ulseth said. “These flow gauges tell us how much water is in any part of the river throughout the system and is essential to municipal water to decision makers, dam operators, (utility) power operators and fishermen.”
The government water monitoring benefits the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which draws 3.5 million annual visitors.
The scientific water surveying covers a 48-mile stretch between the Buford Dam and Atlanta. The employees also track water levels, flooding and dam releases at the Buford Dam.
“They’re fishing, they’re tubing, they’re kayaking,” Ulseth said. “So the health of the river and the amount of pathogens that are in the river are very important to the people that are going there. With the bacteria alert program, we are able to actually predict the current levels of E. coli and give public health advisories in real time, which is a one-of-a-kind program in the entire country.”
Atlanta Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock expressed their concerns about potential layoffs in a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.
The relocation plans remain unclear despite the office lease set to terminate in a few months, the senators wrote Tuesday.
“Staff at the (center) perform water quality testing to ensure the safety of drinking water and maintain water gauges across Georgia, including Lake Sidney Lanier and on the Chattahoochee River, which supplies most of metro Atlanta’s drinking water,” Ossoff and Warnock wrote. “Local officials in metro Atlanta rely on gauges at Lake Lanier to ensure enough water is drawn from the lake to provide water to millions of Georgians every day. These gauges also inform water flows for Georgia’s agriculture industry, nuclear reactors across the state, and Department of Defense installations, among others.”
The potential ramifications of staff layoffs at the Norcross science center is also being watched closely by Suwannee Riverkeeper John Quarterman in south Georgia.
He said his organization relies on the data to predict the risk of flooding in areas like the Skipper Bridge on the Withlacoochee River north of Valdosta.
“It will be a problem for flood preparedness if (flood mapping) goes away, or if either of those gauges does,” Quarterman said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The environment in Pierre today is “more strident” than it was when David Owen began lobbying South Dakota lawmakers in 1998. Much has changed since then, Owen said, but that’s been the biggest shift.
Owen said Pierre’s deeply divided political environment, particularly among Republicans, is one where policy debates turn personal. He describes it as “a cancer in the system.”
“We used to have battles, take the vote, then go on and see each other at dinner. Those days are gone,” Owen said.  
Owen, 70, is retiring. He’s been president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry for nearly three decades, representing the state’s business interests in and out of the Capitol building. Before that, he worked for various Midwest chambers, including in Kansas and Montana.
Owen’s favorite part of the job has always been explaining the policymaking process, whether to state lawmakers or a boardroom of business leaders. He’s known for his sharp wit and policy knowledge, and has earned a reputation for occasionally breaking from the pack, especially when compromise or principle demanded it.
Ahead of his August exit from professional life, Owen sat down with South Dakota Searchlight to reflect on the art of lobbying, shifts in the Legislature, and what he sees as both the promise and peril of South Dakota politics. 
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What made you interested in lobbying lawmakers?
I’ve always been interested in policy and politics. So I chose chambers that were involved in those kinds of issues. 
I was going to be a teacher. And what I like about what I’ve done is that I teach every day. 
I teach legislators the perspective of the chamber, which gets difficult at times. And I have to teach my board about the issues and pressures around us. Because my board’s full of really smart people, successful business people, who get frustrated with the ups and downs of politics. 
What is the biggest misconception about lobbying?
There’s this idea that the lobbyists always win.
We do have a tremendous advantage over citizens who come to the Legislature. It’s something I’m uneasy about. A bill has its hearing, and then they vote on the bill. That means a lot of citizens show up to say “Me too” and bring their concerns. They’ve got their piece of paper. They’ve never done this before. They’re really nervous. 
Meanwhile, the paid lobbyists, including the one you’re talking to, already have a pretty good idea what the vote’s going to be, because we’re there all day. We catch legislators in the hall. We don’t bribe anybody, but we’re familiar with them. 
South Dakota is increasingly becoming pay-to-play. They do fundraisers and we have a political action committee, but legislators are independent enough that we don’t have the kind of control over them that the public seems to think. Otherwise, nobody would lose.
This year, I was talking to some of the freshmen legislators who had never served before. 
I heard from like five of them, the same answer that was pretty different than in the past. I asked the question, “What prompted you to run?”
I heard more about concerns about “society” and how they thought they could help straighten out “the culture” by being in the Legislature. That’s a big task. That brings you to introducing things like school vouchers. That brings you to thinking the Ten Commandments in every classroom will help structure a moral code that will solve some of these social problems. 
And there are two influential lobbying groups up there, we’ve got more, but two groups in particular, that have added to the schism: the abortion people and the gun people. They don’t reach across any aisle. 
Other lobbying groups, like the chamber, are involved in all kinds of business. We’re involved in a whole bunch of issues. We’ve got lobbyists that are banging on each other on one issue, working together on another. The abortion people don’t do that. The NRA doesn’t do that. Instead, they send nasty postcards out. 
You used to be a Republican and later registered as an independent. Why?
What finally got me to pull the trigger on leaving the party was Merrick Garland’s proposed nomination to the Supreme Court, him not getting a hearing. Because Republicans were all saying you can’t do this when there’s a presidential election. 
And then, with unbelievable speed, closer to the election than that, Republicans got Amy Coney Barrett confirmed. And that was perfectly OK.
I just thought, “I don’t think we have any principles here.” 
I had run ballot campaigns 12, 13 times in two states by then. I get roughness. I get things getting ugly. But I’d like to think that we have some principles that we will stand by, and that just flushed it out of me. 
How has the business of lobbying itself changed?
My wife, Debra, who had been a lobbyist for the local chamber, was recently terminated. So, she spent some time as a contract lobbyist. 
And I now understand this whole game of contract lobbying better. So, I don’t know if I’m noticing changes or if I’m better educated.
In the world of contract lobbying, you have two camps. You have a camp where people are coming to certain lobbyists because they have a reputation of being very effective. And they charge a certain range, starting around $20,000 and it goes up. And then some people are just starting, kind of looking for clients.
It’s interesting to me the number of out-of-state groups, national groups, that have some agenda and are hiring these contract lobbyists. 
There’s more people with money forming groups, that in turn hire lobbyists to do, quite honestly, some fairly obscure crap. 
For example, another lobbyist reached out to me, and he had a group of trailer manufacturers who wanted to change one of our laws that requires trailer manufacturers to be affiliated with dealerships. 
So, this group in some orbit around some star finds him and says, “Can you help us change this?”
What are the right reasons to want to become a lobbyist? 
I’ve done what I’ve done for 45-plus years, 27 sessions, because I’m called to stand in this scene between business and government. 
I have profound respect for people who work for the public. I have great respect for my members and my board members. They’re two totally different systems. The balance sheet for legislators is how they vote and how they feel. That’s not a balance sheet for a business. 
My advice is to deal with facts. Listen. You can learn a lot. Be yourself, unless you’re an a—–. And know why you’re there, but respect and try to learn why other people are there. 
Every time we find something in the law that looks really stupid, I go back to when it passed. Every mistake we’ve made, we made on purpose. There was a reason that they convinced everybody in 1920 to vote for, I don’t know, tying up horses. 
I think the right reason is to solve problems. If you’re there sincerely, I think that’s the right thing. I don’t like the process when it sinks to the level of win-at-all-costs. I don’t like when it gets abusive – when they’re sending out postcards cards because they found out a lawmaker against their cause was picked up for a DUI when they were 18 years old. 
The wrong reason is just wanting to publicly humiliate those opposing your cause. That makes good people fearful of getting involved. And we’re going through some of that right now. 
The Republican Party is clearly divided into two sides. Right to Life, the NRA, the carbon pipeline people, those groups like to send out nasty cards. I think that’s a cancer in this system.

The planned casino will sit near the border of Ada and Elmore counties in southwest Idaho. (Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home.
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture.
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe
The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino.
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming.
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options.
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On March 17, Beson was noticed walking on Village Road near Wayman Lane toward Hwy. 47 on the Lac du Flambeau Reservation.
Six days later, family members reported Beson missing on March 23.
Beson was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. She is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair, and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos on her neck, arms, and legs.
Ground searches began on March 24 and 25, and aerial and underwater drones covered the Bear River in the vicinity where Beson was last seen.
Over 360 surveillance cameras positioned near tribal properties and monitored by full-time police employees had recorded footage reviewed without any evidence of Beson.
Subsequent ground searches were hampered by the heavy snowfall, but since most of the snow has melted, ground searches have resumed.
Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Chief TJ Bill reports that on April 16, a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) plane provided aerial coverage, and he expects the DNR aircraft will again be available on Monday, April 21.
So far, Bill said, searchers have covered over 824 acres of forest.
“We are not saying she is out in the forest, but we need to make sure, and this is why we are doing the searches,” said Bill.
Recently police received reports that Beson was seen in the Wausau area. 
Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday, April 8, that her daughter might be with friends and she noted her daughter also likes to travel to other states, but in the past, Beson has always stayed in communication.
“Usually, she calls me if she needs money or is in trouble, but she hasn’t called me,” she said.
“We have been getting numerous reports Melissa is in the Wausau area,” said Bill, “but nothing has been substantiated. We have our officers travelling to Wausau and other areas.”  
Beson’s mother also said she is afraid Melissa might have been kidnapped by human traffickers. Native Americans have been targeted by human traffickers who prey on vulnerable populations where there is poverty and high drug use.
According to the Indian Law Resource Center, Native American women experience the highest rates of sexual assault of any group and are10 times more likely to experience domestic violence than white women. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate that is 10 times the national average. 
The missing and murdered Indigenous women plus relatives (MMIW/R) movement has strived to raise awareness of the plight of Indigenous people in North America. 
May 5 is Red Dress Day,  a national day of awareness for MMIW/R.
Wisconsin has a MMIW/R Task Force that is part of the Department of Justice, but Wisconsin doesn’t have a full time office as in Minnesota, which monitors  MMIW/R cases, assists families,  coordinates information for r law enforcement agencies and offers rewards for information.
Concerning the search for Beson, Bill said his office has one officer dedicated to the case who is also coordinating the searches with the help of the tribe’s emergency management office.
“Our two detectives are spending the majority of their time on the case, working social media search warrants for cellular telephones (Verizon), Facebook, Snap Chat and Google, working with these entities on past history locations,” said Bill. “If we’re not handling current cases/calls coming into the PD, we are working this case non-stop.”
Bill said the public may be invited to help in the search for Beson, but he is concerned that volunteers stay safe in the large forest where it is easy to become disoriented and lost.
“These areas are dangerous to the novice, and we cannot afford the volunteers to work the swamp and bog areas,” he said. “There is still some ground freeze, but areas of the swamps have thawed areas with deep mud. We got stuck at times [Thursday] in the swamps.  When safe and weather conditions are good, we will ask for volunteer support.”
Anyone with any information regarding Beson’s whereabouts should call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.
Acknowledgements
Bill wanted to acknowledge organizations that have helped with  the search for Beson.
“We literally have thousands of hours into this investigation, which involves so many entities, not just ourselves,” said Bill.
Organizations that have helped include:
LDF Emergency Management, LDF Tribal Roads,  LDF Tribal Wardens, LDF Natural Resources, LDF Victim Services, LDF Economic Support, LDF Prosecutor, Newbold Fire Search and Rescue, LDF Fire and EMS, Arbor Vitae Fire and EMS, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office and Dispatch, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office Jail, Vilas County IT Department, LDF IT Department, Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office, DNR, Wisconsin Emergency Management, Wausau Police Department, Mountain Bay Metro Police, Taylor County Sheriff’s Office, Medford Police Department, Forest County Sheriff’s Office, Crandon Police Department, Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office, Atkins County Sheriff’s Office – Minnesota, Milwaukee High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) agency, Vilas County Emergency Management, State of Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation, State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections Probation and Parole, Lake of the Torches Casino surveillance, Missing Murdered, Indigenous, plus Relatives  (MMIW/R) Wisconsin Task Force, and Native American Drug and Gang Initiative (NADGI) Task Force.

(John Gray / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is pushing forward with her efforts to force Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson to drop a longtime policy that generally prohibits deputies from directly engaging in federal immigration enforcement within the city’s jail.
In legal filings, Murrill claims the policy — which the state characterizes as a so-called “sanctuary city” policy —  is in direct conflict with a newly passed state law that requires state and local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“The consent decree now sits fundamentally at odds with state law as applicable to immigration detainers,” Murrill said in court documents filed Friday (April 11).
A federal court will now determine whether to allow the state of Louisiana to join a 2011 federal suit that resulted in the policy and whether to throw out the policy altogether. A hearing has been set for April 30.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The state’s campaign against “sanctuary” policies comes as President Donald Trump is pushing local law enforcement agencies to join the federal government in his promised immigration crackdown. Since his inauguration, Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to push for more partnerships between local law enforcement units and federal immigration agencies. A few have already signed up. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a longtime immigration hardliner and Trump ally, has worked with Republican lawmakers in the state to enact laws that encourage those collaborations.
As attorney general, Landry criticized a policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department, under a long-running federal consent decree that blocks officers from enforcing immigration laws.
Neither Murrill’s office nor representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to requests for comment.
In court filings, Murrill said Hutson “does not oppose the [state’s] intervention” in the case.” But a spokesperson for Hutson said that’s not exactly true.
“It’s more accurate that we take no position regarding the state intervention,” a Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
While she has not taken a position for or against increased collaboration with ICE, in an interview with Fox 8 in December, Hutson noted that the jail’s resources were far too stretched to take on immigration enforcement.
“I’m a lawyer. I believe in following the law and court orders and we do that and so that’s what we’re gonna do, continue to follow the law, but I cannot do ICE’s work,” she said. “It’s too big of a load.”
Potential conflict
The sheriff’s policy stems from a 2013 federal court settlement in a civil rights case involving two New Orleans construction workers picked up on minor charges in 2009 and 2010.
Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo sued after they were allegedly illegally held in the city’s jail past the completion of their sentences. The two were held at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency issues such “detainer” requests to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold onto arrestees who are suspected of immigration violations.
Local agencies are only supposed to honor the hold requests for 48 hours, after which they should let detainees free. But in 2009 and 2010, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman detained Cacho and Ocampo for months, according to legal filings in their case against the office.
Ocampo and Cacho settled the case with the Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and Gusman agreed to adopt a new policy on immigration investigations. The resulting policy blocks the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo declined to speak with Verite News on the record. However, filings they submitted to the court last week opposing the state’s intervention in the case argue  that Murrill has “blatantly misrepresented the OPSO policy” by falsely claiming it forces the Sheriff’s Office to disregard all ICE detainers.
The sheriff’s office, like the NOPD, has been under a sweeping federal consent decree for more than a decade. But unlike the NOPD, the jail’s consent decree does not demand that deputies stay away from federal immigration enforcement, only that it release anyone subject to an immigration hold after two days. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which is a party to both consent decrees, has not entered any filings since Murrill moved to bring the state into the Cacho and Ocampo case.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
The OPSO policy remained in place for more than a decade without any controversy until last spring, when the Louisiana Legislature passed a bill — Act 314 — that blocks so-called “sanctuary” policies prohibiting state and local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration agencies like ICE.
A sheriff’s office spokesperson spokesperson said the agency’s policy on ICE detainers is “governed” by the consent judgement in the case. She declined to comment further, as the state is currently challenging the policy, but affirmed that OPSO is “in full compliance with all applicable state laws and valid court orders related to ICE detainers.”

OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The federal building housed agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, sitting state lawmakers, and other officials.
‘11,000 tomorrows’
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor, and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices, and other various federal agencies.
Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

Where are the 92 percent?
That has been a persistent question since the presidential election, referring to the Black women who overwhelmingly organized and voted for Kamala Harris and then seemingly went dark after November 5. For many of them — who have largely rejected Donald Trump in his three campaigns for president — Harris’ loss felt like a betrayal, and another signal of disrespect from a democracy they have long worked hard to shape.
In the early days of the Trump administration, there have been feelings of anger, resolve, resignation and exhaustion among Black women and many other Americans frustrated with the president’s actions and the current political climate. Earlier this month, millions of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country to make their voices heard as Trump and ally Elon Musk have sought to dramatically remake the federal government, with consequences for real Americans.
The crowds were overwhelmingly White, not the typical makeup of other recent protest movements. Many of the Black women who have been among the leaders of such movements in the past decade, were noticeably — and intentionally — absent.
The Black women I talk to said they are being strategic, pragmatic and creative about what their resistance looks like now, preparing for a long fight ahead, and rejecting narratives that suggest their lack of visibility in this moment translates into inaction.
“People are paying more attention to what Black women are doing because of the impact we had in the election,” said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “We pointed people in the right direction and they did not follow. We may be out of sight to some people, but we’re not checked out by any stretch. The crisis in America is certainly not out of our minds.”

Within weeks of the election, a meme began to circulate of a group of Black women sitting on the roof of a building, sipping their beverages and watching the country burn. The message: Black women would do nothing to help if the democracy they’d tried to save went up in flames.
This month, another image quickly gained traction during the “Hands Off” protests: a photograph of White marchers filing past a restaurant while Black people having brunch looked on, unbothered.
While the idea that Black women deserve rest is showing up in organic social media content, it’s also part of a campaign of misinformation, said Esosa Osa, founder of Onyx Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to researching Black online communities and fighting harmful information that targets Black voters. Emphasizing Black women talking about rest can discourage others in this key Democratic voting bloc from engaging civically.
“We are seeing bad actors trying to influence and suppress Black engagement in a really targeted and hostile way,” Osa said. “We should be cautious of any narrative that’s just, ‘Black women won’t turn out or won’t engage civically.’  Those are the types of narratives that folks working against Black power would want to uplift and amplify. Just because you don’t see your Black friend at a protest doesn’t mean we’re not working or being strategic.”
A lot of that strategy is happening behind the scenes, said Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “intersectionality” and is a leading legal and civil rights scholar at UCLA and Columbia Law School. Crenshaw added that she has been skeptical of much of what she has seen online about Black women “resting.”
“I see a contrast between what’s being given to me on social media and what I’m seeing in the trenches,” Crenshaw said. “Are we tired? Yes. Are we heartbroken? Absolutely. Are we willing to roll over and let this … happen to us without hearing from us? I’m not seeing that, not in the circles I talk to. We don’t have an option not to fight.”

Nelson is among the Black women in the fight now, tapping into LDF’s long history of legal activism to make American democracy live up to its values. The group was among several civil rights organizations that filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging Trump’s executive order calling for sweeping election changes.
Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women’s Law Center, said Black women are leading a lot of the strategy in this time, pointing to colleagues like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood; Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable, a network focused on the political and economic power of Black women; and SEIU President April Verrett. In February, Graves’ organization, a nonprofit advancing gender justice, filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s executive orders that take aim at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Asked about this month’s protests, Graves said she was not surprised to see White Americans — who make up the majority of the federal workforce — as the main participants.
“The folks who usually come to the streets first are the ones who see the direct impact,” Graves pointed out. “You haven’t always seen groups like that in the streets. I actually feel good about Black women’s leadership at this time. They understand the assignment fully.”
And there are others, focused on building community, messaging to counteract negative narratives and protesting with the power of their purses.

In the days leading up to Trump’s joint address to Congress, an idea was launched by Black activists, organizers and strategists including Angela Rye, Leah Daughtry and Tamika Mallory to provide an alternative to the president’s speech: a marathon of online programming aimed at educating and empowering Black Americans impacted by the new administration.
“State of the People” streamed for 24 hours and has since evolved into a 10-city tour starting April 26 in Atlanta that will include mutual aid, political education and town halls.
“We have not stopped; we are focused on not just surviving, but making sure we don’t lose ground on what we have achieved as a people in this country,” said Campbell, one of the organizers of the State of the People effort. “This is designed to build a larger, intergenerational movement, showing the potential of long-term, sustained organizing on the ground and online.”
During the Lenten season, Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Atlanta-based mega congregation New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, called for a 40-day boycott of Target after the retailer announced it would scale back its DEI initiatives. The campaign came in the wake of the Trump administration’s executive orders calling for an end to such programs, which the president referred to as “radical and wasteful.” Black consumers, many of them women, make up nearly 9 percent of Target shoppers. While the full impact of the boycott is unclear, the company’s stock price has dropped, foot traffic to stores has slowed significantly and net quarterly sales decreased as a result.
Last month, 100 women did a “buy-in” at a Washington, D.C.-area Costco to show support for the store’s commitment to DEI as part of an annual summit organized by the Black Women’s Roundtable. Campbell said the gathering also included a day on Capitol Hill hosted by Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blount Rochester — the nation’s two Black women senators — focused on federal budget priorities including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
Campbell said she has been part of different organizing efforts since the election and strategizing around protecting Black women’s leadership in this moment.
“Part of resistance is self-care,” Campbell said. “That does not have anything to do with not fighting, because we are. We said we were going to take some rest after November 5, but there was never any notion that we weren’t going to fight for our freedom in this country.”

Resistance to the Trump administration, including for Black women, is still taking shape. Campbell said she invites allies whom she felt left down by after the election to step up now. What is clear in this unprecedented moment is that it will not look like it has looked before.
Nelson said Black women’s roles now must be “very targeted, very pinpointed, because we are in a crisis unlike anything we have seen in modern history for Black women.”
“We’re taking it very seriously,” Nelson said. “To the extent people sense silence or reserve, those energies are being put to good use, just in a quiet way.”
When the moment is right, Graves predicted that Black women could also take their protest to the streets.
“That’s part of being a strategist,” she said. “We’ll know when it’s time for us to engage, and that’s OK.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-15-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-20 11:07:07.320676

(Photo by Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”
  Wunderlin struggled for years to find stable employment due to health issues, bouncing from one minimum-wage job to another around Dayton, Ohio.

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

They also marched along the sidewalks surrounding the Capitol, joining protests taking place in cities across the country.
The sound of church bells around downtown Lansing coincided with the start of the rally organized by Stand Against Extremism, or  SAGE, and promoted on social media, highlighting their call for freedom, equality, and justice, and their solidarity with nationwide protests organized by grassroots protest group 50501. 
Protests were also held across Michigan, including in Coldwater, Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Livonia, Port Huron, and Portage.
As the first speakers took their positions at the entrance to the Capitol, hundreds more people approached the Capitol grounds with anti-Trump, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-Nazi signs and banners.
“This is the anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution, and the democratic rights that were established during that revolution, and later confirmed and developed in the American Civil War, are now under attack,” said Tim Rivers, 65, a member of the socialist movement, during his speech.
“Hundreds have already been sent [to the El Salvodoran prison known as CECOT], and now Trump is threatening to take American citizens and deport them to El Salvador,” Rivers added.

On April 17, Juan Carlos López-Gómez, 20, was released after being arrested in Florida by federal immigration agents, despite being a natural-born American citizen. However, Lopez-Gomez was not the only U.S citizen who had an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Ramiro Martinez, a Mexican immigrant and U.S. citizen, was surrounded and detained by ICE in Michigan earlier this month.
Additionally, concerns about border patrol agents’ actions under Trump’s policies have been fueled by emails sent on April 11, around the country, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immigrants who entered the country using CBP One, a mobile app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with an American citizen in Michigan also receiving those messages.
Around 12:30, the march began on W. Allegan Street and marched once around the Capitol, as protesters chanted against the current administration.

“The purpose of our march was basically to defend our democracy. We wanted people to come out and express their discomfort with what is going on a national scale,” said Daniel Pfau, 37, a volunteer with SAGE. “I hope that people see this event is by the people, for the people. We didn’t need a national organization in charge. We showed up, and we took care.”
After the march, a series of speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience. Among the speakers were community members, social activists, and elected officials who primarily spoke out against the federal government’s targeting of immigrants across the country.
“They are trying to distract us. They want people divided. They want to bring out the worst impulses in many people’s hearts,” said State Rep. Jasper Martus (D-Flushing) during his speech. “We need to think about all those folks who are going to church tomorrow morning and saying they’re okay with deporting people who are here illegally. I’m a believer, but that’s not what I believe in.”
During the speeches, support was given for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident the Trump administration erroneously deported to his native El Salvador, which was echoed and chanted by the audience in favor of his release and return to the US.
Abrego Garcia was arrested March 12 as he drove his 5-year-old son home, and was informed by ICE agents that his status had changed, despite an order that determined it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador” if he were returned there, according to court documents.
Although ICE accepted his deportation was due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court of the United States later ordered his return, on April 14, U.S. President Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in the Oval Office that they would not release Abrego Garcia.
Toward the end of the demonstration, near the Capitol, on the side of North Capitol Avenue, a Trump supporter counter-protested, giving speeches and holding a sign that read “God, put Trump in.” This situation generated tense moments among the protesters, who approached to confront and argue with the lone counter-protestor. 
By the end of the day, no acts of violence or physical confrontations had been reported.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration proposed a new rule Wednesday that would rescind widespread habitat protections for species protected under the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law enacted in 1973 to conserve the country’s imperiled animals and plants.
That would open the door for developments across the country to be approved even if they significantly disrupt critical habitat for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed rule, posted in the U.S. Federal Register by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, would “rescind the regulatory definition of ‘harm,’” which is defined as any significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife.
Environmental groups lambasted the proposal.
“There’s just no way to protect animals and plants from extinction without protecting the places they live, yet the Trump administration is opening the floodgates to immeasurable habitat destruction,” said Noah Greenwald, co-director of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds, but most Americans know that we destroy the natural world at our own peril. Nobody voted to drive spotted owls, Florida panthers or grizzly bears to extinction.”
If approved, he said, the rule would mean endangered species would only be protected from actions that intentionally lead to the harm of a species. “It’s just foundational to how we’ve protected endangered species for the last 40-plus years, and they’re just completely upending that,” Greenwald said.










This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds.


–  Noah Greenwald, Center for Biological Diversity


Just the day before Wednesday’s proposed rule, the Trump administration put out a rescission notice to roll back a rule that put conservation on equal footing with extractive uses on the nation’s public lands. The two decisions, along with scores of others in recent months since President Trump took office, threaten species and the habitats they depend on across the country, experts and environmentalists say.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment.
 What does ‘harm’ mean? 

By law, the ESA prohibits the “take” of an endangered species, which includes actions “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Historically, the “harm” part of this mandate encompasses “any activity that can modify a species’ habitat.”
This interpretation of “harm” has long been used by agencies to extend protections for endangered species to the land or ocean area that it relies on. For example, an oil or gas project may not be able to drill or be forced to modify operations in a certain area that provides habitat for an endangered animal, such as a dune sagebrush lizard. In many cases, the “harm” rule has not blocked projects altogether, but rather resulted in different designs that reduce impacts on endangered species.
In 1995, a group of landowners and timber interests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast challenged the regulation’s interpretation in a push to log forests where endangered northern spotted owls and red-cockaded woodpeckers lived. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the broad definition of “harm” on the basis of the Chevron Doctrine, a principle that defers to federal agencies’ expertise for carrying out laws. Last year, however, Chevron was overturned, and the Trump administration has seized on that in the new proposed rule.
The new proposal would eliminate this “harm” definition—and the habitat protections that come with it, according to Dave Owen, an environmental law professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“The shift here would be to say that just habitat modification that is detrimental to a species, even if the detriment is fairly direct, is not encompassed within the word ‘harm,’” Owen said. The majority of habitat protections related to the ESA fall under the “harm” interpretation, according to a 2012 study by Owen. Now, under the proposal, “the word ‘harm’ is essentially going to be read as an inconsequential nullity,” he said.
The Trump administration says that its proposal is more in line with the language in the ESA, arguing that the regulations surrounding the word “harm” should be defined as an “affirmative act directed immediately against a particular animal,” rather than one that could indirectly harm an endangered species’ population, according to the posting of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. However, research shows that habitat loss is a primary driver of extinction in the United States.
In the case of the spotted owl, nests must have a 70-acre circle of land around them protected, even on private lands used for timber. “With this change, they don’t have to do that anymore,” said Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The Trump administration’s proposal is the latest in a series of deregulatory moves to undermine the ESA, which Republicans have long attacked for stifling economic development and interfering with states’ ability to manage wildlife. Rolling back its ability to protect species was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative roadmap published before the 2024 elections guiding much of the administration’s actions.
On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” which outlined a process to enable fossil fuel projects to bypass the typical environmental reviews associated with approval, including those required by the Endangered Species Act. The order directed the heads of all agencies and the secretary of the Army to identify projects “that may be subject to emergency treatment” within 30 days. By mid-February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers marked for review more than 600 permit applications for energy-related projects that could qualify for the fast-pass treatment, though environmental groups argue these efforts would disrupt crucial wetlands.
To support efforts for “unleashing energy dominance,” the secretary of the Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, issued several orders in February that aim to “suspend, revise, or rescind” several ESA regulations enacted during the Biden administration. This new proposal to rescind the harm definition could also pave the way for new energy projects, experts say.
The historic interpretation of the regulation served “as sort of a caution to people not to go down and knock down trees where red-cockaded woodpeckers were nesting. And if you change the definition, I think there’s the risk that people are going to go out and engage in that behavior in the real world,” said Andrew Mergen, the director of Harvard Law School’s Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. “The rule plays a really important role in preventing people from doing that sort of thing, and at the same time, it has hardly damaged the economy, or made economic progress impossible.”
The public will have 30 days to submit comments on the proposal. Environmental groups like Earthjustice have vowed to challenge the rule in court.
 A series of attacks on conservation

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the administration proposed rescinding the Public Lands Rule—a landmark achievement of the Biden administration that placed conservation on equal footing as extraction across the nation’s public lands following an extensive public comment period. Ninety  percent of comments received supported the rule. Another rule implemented last year that restricts oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was also rescinded.
“This is not policy—it’s a blatant giveaway to industry that threatens to dismantle decades of conservation progress, shut down public access, harm wildlife and accelerate the reckless sell-off of our natural resources,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, in a statement concerning the two proposed rescission notices.
Already this year, a series of executive orders and actions by Trump have removed protections across millions of acres in national forests to boost the logging industry, streamlined the permitting process for mines, made the extraction of minerals on public lands with suitable resources the priority use, and targeted national monuments elimination. Staff at national parks have also been gutted.
All of this has come despite polling showing that conserving public lands is universally popular across party lines.
“The Trump administration is just working to undermine all protections for air, for water, for wildlife and climate—systematically and rapidly,” Greenwald said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)MANSFIELD — When DeSoto Regional Health System took out $36 million in loans last year to renovate a rural hospital that opened in 1952, officials were banking on its main funding source remaining stable: Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for low-income people and the disabled.
But those dollars are now in jeopardy, as President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress move to shrink the nearly $900 billion health program that covers more than 1 in 5 Americans.
DeSoto CEO Todd Eppler said Medicaid cuts could make it harder for his hospital to repay the loans and for patients to access care.
“I just hope that the people who are making these decisions have thought deeply about it and have some context of the real-world implications,” he said, “because it’s going to affect us as a hospital and going to affect our patients.”

One of the decision-makers is Eppler’s representative in Congress: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who lives about 35 miles north of here. He said he knows the Republican leader and his staff understand hospitals’ plight: The mother of Johnson’s chief of staff is CEO of a rural hospital in the district.
“I’ve never met a congressman yet that wanted a rural hospital in their district to close, and certainly Mike is no exception to that rule,” Eppler said.
Last year nearly 290,000 people in Johnson’s district were enrolled in Medicaid, about 38% of the total population, according to data compiled by KFF, the health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
About 118,000 of them are in the program thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states including Louisiana to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, many of whom were working in low-paying jobs that don’t provide health insurance.
Louisiana ranks second in Medicaid enrollment, at nearly 32% — a reflection of the state’s high poverty rate. As Republicans weigh cuts, their actions could have dramatic consequences for their constituents here. Of the eight GOP-held House districts with the most Medicaid enrollees due to the expansion, four are in Louisiana. Johnson’s largely rural district ranks sixth in expansion enrollees.
Among them is Chloe Stovall, 23, who works in the produce aisle at the SuperValu grocery store in Vivian. She said her take-home wage working full time is $200 a week. She doesn’t own a car and walks a mile to work.
The store provides health coverage, but she said she won’t qualify until she’s worked there for a full year — and even then, it will cost more than Medicaid, which is free.
“I’m just barely surviving,” she said.
In February, Johnson pushed a budget resolution through the House that calls for cutting at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid, to help fund an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and his border priorities. Republicans in Congress are now considering where to make cuts, and Medicaid is likely to take a big hit.
Defending the plan, Johnson said that Medicaid is “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Stovall said almost everyone she knows on Medicaid works at least one job. “I don’t even own a TV,” she said.
Contacted for comment, Johnson’s office pointed to his remarks at a conference in Washington last month. “We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson said.

KFF Health News spoke with two dozen Medicaid enrollees in Johnson’s district. Most said they were unaware their congressman is leading the Republican charge to upend the program. Those informed of the Republican plan said it scares them.
Some GOP members of Congress want to eliminate the ACA’s Medicaid expansion funding, which led to 20 million working-age adults gaining coverage and helped slash the nation’s uninsured rate to its lowest level in history. Forty states and the District of Columbia have agreed to the change, which promised extra federal funding in exchange for expanding eligibility.
In this heavily Republican district, where Johnson won with 86% of the vote in November, 22% of residents live in poverty.
Like Trump, Johnson says he wants cuts to Medicaid but hasn’t elaborated other than saying the program should not cover “able-bodied” adults without imposing a work requirement.
“Everybody is committed” to preserving Medicaid benefits “for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it,” Johnson said at a news conference in February. “What we’re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste, and abuse.”
Medicaid recipients in Johnson’s district, told about GOP plans to cut the program, said their lives are hard enough in a state where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Without Medicaid, they said, they couldn’t afford health coverage.
In Vivian, near the borders with Arkansas and Texas, close to half of the 2,900 residents live in poverty. The main-street shops are mostly shuttered, except for a thrift store and a mom-and-pop restaurant that specializes in fried pork chops.
“Most everybody you know is on Medicaid here,” said Doris Luccous, 24.
Luccous said she makes $250 a week after taxes as a housekeeper at a nursing home while raising her 2-year-old daughter in her childhood home. While shopping with her father — who doesn’t work, because of a disability — she said she counts on Medicaid for her bipolar medicines and to pay for therapy appointments.
“I don’t know where I would be without it,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Luccous nor Stovall said they voted in the last election, and neither knew that Johnson is their representative in Congress.
Vivian has few large employers, and most employers pay the minimum wage, which hasn’t changed since 2009. “We are just stuck,” Stovall said.
Still, she said, “it’s a community where everybody knows everybody, and people are always willing to lend a hand because so many are in difficult financial circumstances.”
Willie White is CEO of David Raines Community Health Centers, which operates six outpatient clinics in northwestern Louisiana that serve primarily Medicaid enrollees. He said that Louisiana already ranks among the worst states for people’s health and that Medicaid cuts would only worsen the situation.
“You cannot expect health outcomes to improve if people can’t afford to access care,” White said.
While the clinics provide primary and dental care on a sliding fee scale for uninsured patients, signing them up for Medicaid gives them better access to specialists and brings the health centers revenue to cover the cost of delivering care.

Many of the centers’ patients gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. Afterward, rates of screenings for colon and cervical cancer went from 10% to 50%, White said.
But if Congress cuts Medicaid, the health centers would be forced to cut services, he said.
“Mike Johnson has been here and knows us, and he and his office have been responsive about our issues,” White said. “The message in prior years was, ‘We need additional funding,’ but now it is asking for no cuts.”
Community health centers, which in 2023 provided care nationally to more than 32 million mostly low-income people, have seen funding increases from Republicans and Democrats for decades.
“Everyone is supportive, but the question remains what that support will look like under the current administration,” White said. “If there are to be reductions, they need to be done with a scalpel.”
Expecting cuts, the health centers have already restricted travel and put a hold on filling vacant positions, White said.
Sitting in a David Raines clinic in Bossier City, Benjamin Andrade, 57, said having Medicaid has been a lifesaver since he needed heart surgery in 2020. Andrade is a chef and said he supports his wife and two children on $14 an hour.
He had not heard about any potential cuts to the program. Without Medicaid, he said, “it would be very hard for me to pay for all the medicines I take.”
Dominique Youngblood, 31, who was at the clinic for a dental checkup, said she’s had Medicaid most of her life. “Medicaid helps me so I don’t have to pay out-of-pocket going to the doctors,” she said.
Youngblood, who has two children, makes $12 an hour at a day care center. Asked about GOP efforts to scale back the program, she said, “It’s not fair, because it helps a lot of people who cannot afford medications and emergency room trips, and those are costs you can’t control.”

Back in Mansfield, Eppler’s hospital is more than just a health facility — it’s where many people in town come for lunch. The cafeteria was packed on a recent Friday as workers served boiled shrimp, fried okra, and baked fish.
Eppler said he’s aware Republicans in Congress are targeting a system of taxes that some states, including Louisiana, levy on hospitals and other health providers to draw down more federal Medicaid funding. That money helps finance what are known as supplemental payments to providers. Some conservatives belittle the extra funding as “money laundering.”
But that money accounts for about 15% of the DeSoto health system’s budget, said Eppler, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has been CEO for a dozen years. “We are using that money to invest in the next 50 years of Desoto Parish, to build a hospital that they can have that will be sustainable,” he said.
The supplemental payments, for example, help pay to provide mental health services at three outpatient clinics. “If that $4 million went away, we would have to limit services — it’s just that simple,” he said.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voter-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

He wants to meet the moment with uncompromising defiance.,"Sen. Chris Murphy was dropped at the L Street entrance of Washington, D.C.’s convention center and hustled through the kitchen to a ballroom where 2,000 progressive activists waited to hear his thoughts on what to do about the 47th president of the United States and the sorry state of the Democratic Party.
The audience was midway through a weeklong, largely off-the-record summit of “America Votes,” the self-described “coordination hub of the progressive community.” It promised “experts, strategists, and renowned progressive leaders to begin writing the next chapter of the American story.”
Among them was Murphy, 51, the Democratic junior senator from Connecticut. Reelected in November to a third term, Murphy is in his third new phase as a senator — the first 10 years building a gun control movement, the last two as a broker of bipartisan deals on gun safety and border control.
“And now I’m trying to convince my party to meet the moment and bash these guys over the head with a baseball bat, metaphorically,” Murphy said.
The moment, as Murphy describes it in increasingly heated terms in person and online, is a campaign by President Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk to undermine the press and bully law firms, universities and business leaders into submission, and the only way it can be met is with uncompromising, if risky, defiance.
“Our democracy isn’t at risk of dying. It is dying as we speak. We are watching it die. It is not too late to save it,” Murphy said in a Senate speech on April 10. “We say that again, it is not too late to save our democracy, but we can’t continue to close our eyes and think that our democracy can survive a coordinated assault on those four key institutions of accountability.”
Murphy is a multiplatform messenger, a believer in repetition. On Thursday night, unshaven and casually dressed after a basketball game with the youngest of his two teenage sons, he delivered a live video briefing on Instagram that repurposed and updated the Senate speech.
“So, I want to go over events that have been developing really, really fast. Trump’s plan is real. He has a plan,” said Murphy, who has 200,000 followers on Instagram and one million on X. “He is implementing it to convert our democracy to some form of autocracy, and that’s the only way that you can get away with the corruption and the thievery.”

Online, where his Instagram remarks got more than 12,000 “likes” by Saturday morning, or the previous week while addressing a live audience in the convention center ballroom, Murphy preaches and teaches the gospel of resistance, rallies and “mass mobilizations” as the counter to Trump’s efforts to quell dissent.
“They’re playing a different game, and whether we like it or not, we have to choose to fight on the terms that they’re setting,” Murphy told the activists. It is time, he said, for Democrats “to take big swings” on both tactics and policies. The message from Murphy is not new, but similar calls are popping up in unexpected places, such as buttoned-down David Brooks calling for an “uprising” on the New York Times opinion page.
As Murphy told the activists, he would have preferred that Democrats boycotted the president’s speech to a joint session of Congress, as he did.
“He has an obligation to give a real State of the Union speech, not run a reality show, not stand up on stage and tell lie after lie after lie,” Murphy said. “He’s not willing to play that on the level. Why are we willing to play that, right?”
Murphy voted to confirm Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but says there will be no more gestures of cooperation, of recognizing institutional norms. If they are a Trump nominee, they are complicit and to be opposed. He wished his Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, had not voted with Republicans for a budget resolution drafted with no Democratic input. Let the government shut down. Let them own it.
Yes, Murphy said, it would have carried a risk.
“For ordinary Americans to take risks, or, for instance, for law firms or universities to take risks and just say no to this guy when he tries to extort them, then political leaders need to be willing to take risks as well. Right?”  Murphy said.
It was an applause line.

Fundraising like Bernie
Murphy entered the ballroom knowing that a campaign finance filing soon would show that his relentless, blunt and occasionally profane critiques of the Republican president and Democratic Party was putting him in a league with Bernie Sanders in the online game of raising money off opposition to Trump.
The report filed Wednesday shows Murphy spent $3.4 million in the first three months of 2025 on online pitches for help supporting “a political opposition movement” that remains a work in progress, so far producing a single town-hall meeting in Warren, Mich., and the promise of two more this week in North Carolina and Missouri. 
The online appeals, buttressed with constant presence on social media platforms and cable television, plus featured turns with everyone from the New Yorker’s David Remnick to the comedian podcaster Hasan Minhaj, brought in an eye-popping $8 million.
“It’s obviously an uncommon amount of money,” Murphy said. “I mean, it was shocking to me. It was shocking to me that so many people were interested in contributing. And I just feel like I have an obligation to put that money on the ground right now. Even though they were contributing to my election funds, they were really contributing as a means to try to help meet the moment.”
After expenses, Murphy netted $4 million for the quarter, adding to the $5.5 million leftover from his easy reelection last year. 
OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
Among senators not facing reelection in 2026 or 2028, only Sanders raised more in the same period. The independent from Vermont and undisputed leader of the American progressive movement raised $11.4 million, while spending only $1.3 million to prime the pump with digital appeals.
The 83-year-old Sanders has been on the road since Feb. 21 with his “Fighting Oligarchy Tour,” staging 15 rallies in the midwest and west with his 35-year-old ally, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Their stops in Denver and Los Angeles each drew more than 30,000 people.
Sanders figures prominently in Murphy’s retooled messaging: Economic populism should have been the tentpole of Kamala Harris’ campaign, and elements of the Democratic Party owe Sanders an apology for dismissing the two-time presidential candidate as occupying a place on the fringe of politics.

Pugilistic populism
At the America Votes’ summit, which ended as Congress left Washington for a two-week recess on April 11, Murphy insisted the Biden administration, by reinvigorating the Federal Trade Commission and authorizing antitrust actions, had a credible record of standing up for workers and against corporations.
“But Joe Biden wasn’t out there every single day beating the hell out of the tech companies that were poisoning our kids, against the oil companies that were price-gouging us at the pumps, the retail companies that were shipping all of our jobs overseas,” Murphy said. “You have to be engaged in a daily fight with the corporations, the greedy corporations, the price gouging corporations that are screwing Americans.”
Murphy said his new populist rhetoric signifies a change in tone, not philosophy.
“While I’ve always, I think, been a populist, I’m maybe a louder populist,” Murphy said. “I’m maybe more interested in being more pugilistic in my populism.”
During an interview in his office the next day, between speaking at a tax-fairness rally in a park by the Capitol and then giving a floor speech on the mounting threats to democracy, Murphy said a pugilistic populism means naming names, not blandly promising to “fight special interests.” 
“That’s a purposefully cowardly term,” Murphy said. “But when you say, ‘I’m going to attack the way that Amazon is destroying local businesses. I’m going to stop Pfizer and Bristol-Myers from bankrupting families, I’m gonna stop big agriculture from driving up the cost of food’ and tell them how you’re gonna do it, that’s a much more believable populism.”
Stylistically, Murphy runs cooler than Sanders and AOC, who draw energy from crowds. Murphy can sound like he is giving a TED Talk, conversational and informative. On Thursday, after warning that civil disobedience might be necessary sooner than later, he paused and said, “OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.”
Murphy, who managed a congressional campaign when he was 22, always has thought like a political strategist as much as a politician. His rhetoric and fundraising have renewed speculation of presidential ambitions, but some admirers wonder if a better role model would be LBJ, the master of the Senate, not president.
“As long as you are nimble, there are a lot of ways to be continually relevant and make a difference on behalf of things that you care about,” he said, taking break in office. He had just addressed a tax fairness rally outside the Capitol and was about to deliver a speech to the Senate.
He insists his rainmaking, his road trips and his social media are not prepatory to a campaign for higher office. 
“I think part of the reason that my voice is breaking through a little bit right now is that it’s not poisoned by personal ambition,” he said. “I think the reason that I feel and sound a little bit more authentic in my worry about where the country is is because I’m genuinely seized by my worry. And I’m posting videos not to gain followers. I’m posting videos to try to change people’s minds and to try to raise people’s urgency.”
He asserted a strategic role on Nov. 10 with a series of tweets and a 4-minute video in which he delivered a calm if devastating post-mortem of why so many blue-collar Democrats either defected to Trump or didn’t show up.
“We are not listening to the people we claim to represent,” Murphy said in the video. “We claim to be the party of the working class, the party of poor people, and yet we let interest groups and think tanks tell us what those people need. That’s why we end up with these relatively small-ball solutions. Not saying they don’t matter, but more roads and bridges, bulk negotiation of prescription drug prices, little bit bigger tax credit for families with kids, that’s not meeting the moment.”

Spent last week licking wounds. Now it's time to get to work. Some thoughts on the path forward. In short, we need to rebuild the left. No band aids. Admit that our policies don't connect with people emotionally. Stop being so afraid of populist fights. Build a bigger tent. pic.twitter.com/MPNn2mAEFJ— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 10, 2024

That video created an immediate buzz, especially among Sanders supporters who had given up on the Democratic Party, people like Mike Figueredo, the founder and host of “The Humanist Report” podcast. On a show in November, he summarized Murphy’s message as an unexpected validation of Sanders.
“Wow. I’ve got to say I am genuinely shocked to see a sitting Democratic Party senator admit this about the party,” Figueredo said. “I mean, we all know it’s true, but to see them admit it is quite the thing to behold. And of course, he’s exactly right. Democrats shun their working class base because they think that those high income supporters are going to be the ones to carry them.”
Not all of Murphy’s prescription was applauded by Figueredo or others on the left. While pushing the party to be more aggressive and risk-tolerant in fighting Trump, he is also urging it to be less judgmental as a necessary step to reestablishing Democrats as the big-tent party.

On X, Murphy wrote, “You need to let people into the tent who aren’t 100% on board with us on every social and cultural issue, or issues like guns or climate.” In his speech to the activists, Murphy noted he spent the better part of a decade making sure that support for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons was a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates.
“I remember patting myself on the back in 2020 when we held a big forum on gun violence in Las Vegas, Nev., and every single Democratic candidate for president was there, right?” he said. “And every single one of them was singing the same tune. Everyone was for a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. And I was like, ‘Alright, I did my job.’”
Cultural litmus tests have limited the ceiling for Democratic seats in the Senate to 52, Murphy said, and he suggests across-the-board litmus tests might be counterproductive, even on his issue of guns. 
“We maybe should be nominating candidates who believe in the economic populist tentpole but might not line up with us on all of the other cultural, social and hot-button issues,” Murphy said. “That’s a difficult call to make, but I think that might serve two purposes: That might grow the coalition so we win more elections, and that might actually put us in a position to change people’s minds.” 
That was not an applause line, nor did Murphy expect it would be. Murphy was doing his TED Talk thing. He was in teaching mode. 
“Frankly, if you are zeroed in on this question of the billionaire takeover of government, the corporate seizure of our economy, then you can frankly confront the right on their unconscionable scapegoating of gay, transgender kids or immigrants in the exact same sentence in which you are anchoring our message on economic populism, right?” he said.

Distraction and division are elements of Trump’s playbook, he said. Forget about Greenland, the 51st state of Canada and the Gulf of America and keep focused on the real threat of funding tax cuts for the rich by cutting Medicaid, most likely by rolling back the expansion passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. Ninety percent of the expansion is federally funded, and a retreat to the 50-50 state and federal split for the rest of Medicaid would cost Connecticut nearly $1 billion.
“You can say, ‘Listen, the Republicans are corporate shills. They are in the pockets of billionaires, and so they want you to believe that your problems are being caused by gay kids or drag shows or Mexican immigrants,’” Murphy said. “That’s not who’s screwing you, right? Who’s screwing you are unscrupulous insurance companies. What’s screwing you are the tech companies that are poisoning and addicting your kids to their devices. Who’s screwing you is your billionaires who are so rapacious that they’re arguing to cut your insurance off so that they can get another $50,000 tax cut.”
Murphy has been warning about the dangers of disaffection and loneliness since 2022, both in a political and sociological sense. He did so again at the convention center. At a time when the economic metrics were good, he said, too many voters just weren’t feeling it.
“You were seeing epidemic rates of self reported unhappiness in America at a time when unemployment was at a structural low, crime was dropping, test scores were going up,” Murphy said. “And I don’t think you were doing your job as a political leader if you didn’t step back and ask yourself, ‘Why?’ ” 
Democrats didn’t answer that question, at least not in a manner that was heard by disaffected voters, he said. The beneficiary was anyone who practiced the politics of grievance. 
“When you’re feeling powerless, when you’re feeling alone, when you’re feeling empty and devoid of meaning, that’s the moment the demagogues live for, right?” Murphy said. “That’s the moment where somebody who is going to sell a message of division and scapegoating, man, that’s their opportunity.”
Murphy’s higher profile comes at an awkward time. Five days after issuing the election post-mortem, Murphy and his wife, Cathy Holahan, informed friends and, ultimately, the general public of their separation. Five months later, there is no record of either filing for divorce. The topic is one Murphy declines to discuss. 
Last week, the first of the two weeks of the congressional recess, Murphy had no public schedule and spent time with his two sons, who are 13 and 16. Next week, he is going on the road with town-hall meetings in Saxapahaw, N.C., on Thursday and Chesterfield, Mo., on Friday. Both are in Republican congressional districts.

His wingman will be U.S. Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, an up and coming 28-year-old Democrat who represents the 10th Congressional District of Central Florida. He was with Murphy at his event in Warren, Mich. Elected at age 25, Frost is the youngest and first Generation Z member of the House.
Frost ran with the backing of Sanders, and he appeared on stage with him at the Coachella music festival last week.
“I just think he’s one of a handful of members that is meeting the moment,” Murphy said. “I have a real sense of urgency. And if I’m going to be traveling with somebody, I want them to have the same sense of urgency.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MURPHY-PROFILE-27-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-20 06:02:58.649103

By act of Congress, citizens were asked to turn to their Creator in supplication and meditation. This national day of prayer was to be celebrated in statehouses across the land, with every individual invited to offer hosannas or amens or other holy words of praise. The places of lawmaking were transformed into houses of worship, where the symbols dear to the faithful festooned the galleries and holy banners fluttered from balconies.
When the appointed day arrived, lawmakers made thunderous speeches and pounded their desks in protestations of righteousness. There was no louder din than in the capitol building of an interior province, a region known as much for its piety as for the bountiful harvests of wheat and corn. Under a great copper-sheathed dome, choirs of young people sang the praises of the One who made the sky while lawmakers clustered elbow to bended elbow and murmured their approval.
Few remembered the ancient day when the day of supplication became the law of the land, or the war that had prompted its passage, or the innkeeper and the lawmaker who had championed it. An ambassador of this interior province, was not yet born when the day was proclaimed, but from a dais in the capitol rotunda he addressed the assembled flock.
His face was stern as he clutched his holy book and urged the assembled to celebrate the land’s deliverance from the rule of the godless. At long last the battle for theocracy had nearly been won. The faithful were in power under the great copper dome. It would be a small matter to extinguish the infidels entirely. No true patriot could doubt the land was specially ordained by the Almighty for greatness. Victory was at hand. The ambassador bowed his head and asked the One to bestow wisdom on the leaders of the land. He unashamedly asked this for all in the name of peace and love.
No one could remember a more passionate or powerful sermon.
Then an aged stranger approached. She moved silently down the aisle and mounted the platform, her chalky robe swirling like smoke. Her white hair fell in rivulets to her shoulders. Her face was as pale as those of the statues of long-dead statesmen in the alcoves of the rotunda.
The stranger touched the ambassador on the arm and bid him step aside, which the startled man did. She grasped the lectern with skeletal hands and surveyed the congregation with eyes burning with uncanny light.
“I am sent from the Throne,” she said, her voice solemn and deep. “The One has heard your prayers, and they will be granted — if you wish. But know that for every prayer answered, another must be dashed. Each request for favor brings with it the unspoken plea that another be disfavored. All supplications for earthly power are wishes both selfish and damned.”
Her eyes smoldered.
“You have asked the One for victory,” she said, “so that you might rule this land in the way which pleases you. Very well. I will repeat your prayer, as it falls upon the ears of the One above the clouds.”
There were calls for the capitol guards to remove the stranger, but they stood as transfixed as the crowd.
“Almighty One, grant us the power over our political enemies, so that we may not only exalt You but punish them,” she said, her voice growing stronger. “Let us make laws that take the food from their mouths, the homes of their families, and their ability to pay for medicine and doctors to see them through sickness. Grant us the power to choose in their stead the governing of their bodies and their minds. Allow us to restrict the means of controlling conception and then force women to bear unwanted children, even when violated.”
The stranger paused and clutched the robe to her breast.
“Let us purge from their libraries those books we deem to be improper or impious. Allow us to deny our enemies the ability to seek redress by controlling the manner in which their leaders are selected. Grant us the right to banish from our shores those who utter seditious dissent.”
The crowd grew still.
“Let our enemies live from this day forward with fear in their hearts,” the stranger said. “Let them fear the loss of their positions if they speak of equity or inclusion, make them cower if they dare say azure instead of crimson, allow them pain if they insist on choosing how they shall be called by others. Make their nights sleepless in expectation of a knock at midnight’s door. Grant them freedom of worship only if they worship as we do, deny them public office if they refuse any manner of worship, and enforce the social and marital codes of a society these thousands of years dead.”
The ambassador attempted to mutter “blasphemy,” but the word caught in his throat. The stranger regarded him for a moment with pity, then turned back to the crowd.
“Allow no truth to free a human soul,” the stranger continued. “Shutter the great houses of learning lest a whisper be made against the ambassador or his earthly king. Make a virtue of intolerance and paint it as just. Make retribution the supreme law of the land, power the only virtue, and chaos the only mode. Force them to abandon the sacred civic code that once governed this land, just as we have, and accept in their stead whimsy, nonsense and malice. Allow the land to wither beneath tariffs on foreign things, the fear of strangers, and the rapacious hunger of misers and kings.”
The stranger shook her head and her hair floated cloud-like about her face.
“Finally, Greatest One, ignore the prayers of the meek, the young, the sick and the old,” she said, her voice growing soft. “Comfort not those who pray with pure hearts. Reward not those who thirst for righteousness. Punish those who seek the truth. Banish those who challenge power with fact. All are enemies of the state, Greatest One, and are therefore your enemies. Damn their hopes, dash their dreams, and make their eyes wet with tears. Deny them comfort, afflict their spirits, and fill their hearts with lead. Smite them and their generations to come. Forever make them inequal to us. Grant us the end of history and relieve us of the will to change. This we implore of You, in the name of love.”
The stranger paused.
“This is the prayer of your secret hearts,” she said, her voice a quaver. “If you still desire it, speak! The messenger of the One awaits.”
It was reported afterward that the old woman was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what she said. On the way to the asylum, a copy of Mark Twain’s “The War Prayer” was found in the folds of her voluminous robe.

And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical.","While I’m on vacation this week I thought I’d revisit a commentary I wrote in 2014. Judge for yourself how little has changed in 11 years.=======================================Everybody loves to complain about our traffic. And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical. If there were easy answers to our woes, they’d have been implemented by now.
Look… this is really a matter of supply and demand: too much demand (highway traffic) and not enough supply (space on those roads). I think the solution is to manage the demand. But others say it’s a “supply side” issue.


So here are a few of the crazier ideas for fixing our traffic that I’ve seen proposed over the years:
1) Double-deck I-95: Seriously, this was once proposed by the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. Can you imagine the decades of construction and billions in cost, with “upper level” roads having to soar hundreds of feet over existing bridges?
2) Allow trucks on the Merritt Parkway: There are two words to explain why this can’t happen: low bridges.
3) Ban trucks from our interstates: This was once suggested to me by a Fairfield County First Selectman. But as I reminded him… trucks are high-occupancy vehicles delivering goods to the stores where you drive your single-occupancy vehicle to shop. No trucks, no goods, no shopping.
4) Drive in the break-down lane: This was then-Gov. John Rowland’s idea in 2000 and he even wasted a million dollars studying it. But if you think of that far right-hand lane instead as the “emergency rescue lane,” you’ll see why this doesn’t make sense. This plan would also require re-striping the road to create narrower lanes, making driving even more dangerous.
5) Widening I-95 to four lanes: Again, billions in cost and decades of construction. And if you build it, they will come. The immutable law of “induced demand” means that traffic will expand to fill available space. Then what, a fifth lane?
There are better ways to manage congestion, some of them already being implemented:
Operational lanes: Adding a fourth lane from on-ramps to the next off-ramps gives traffic a better chance of merging on and off the highway without blocking the through-lanes.
Widening choke points: For example, the exit 14-15 bottleneck in Norwalk. But this widening project (for less than one mile) cost $50 million and took three years. The I-84 / Route 8 “Mixmaster” rebuild in Waterbury took six years and cost $253 million. Both projects were funded mostly with federal funds, but it’s anyone’s guess what will happen to that money pot under the new administration’s budget cutting.
Add a zipper lane: Sure, this may require highway widening, but just one lane that’s reversible depending on demand, a system that was used successfully on the Tappan Zee Bridge before its reconstruction. By moving the extra lane, capacity can be added to the direction where there’s the most traffic.
Change commuting hours: Does everyone really need to work 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.? How about starting earlier or later and spreading out the traffic? Your employer should understand and you’ll be happier and more productive.
And the very best idea of all: improve mass transit to encourage drivers to  get off of the roads.
As I say, there are no simple solutions to highway congestion. So when anyone says he or she has one, be skeptical. It’s easy to identify the problems. But fixing them will always be hard… and usually expensive.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Traffic-congestion-on-I-95.png,,,2025-04-20 05:00:28.260002

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Major pieces of a $12 billion tax package passed the Washington state Senate on Saturday without a clear sign that Gov. Bob Ferguson supports them.
Democratic senators used their near supermajority to override Republican opposition, approving bills to expand the capital gains tax, increase tax rates on large corporations and big banks, and begin collecting sales tax on an array of services.
Collectively, the legislation would raise around $3.2 billion in the next two-year budget and $5.5 billion over four years, money Democrats are counting on to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall and enact a balanced budget before the regular session ends next weekend.
The most heated debate Saturday centered on Senate Bill 5814, which produces the most dollars — a projected $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It would affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue fiscal analysis.
Meanwhile, the House Finance Committee on Saturday advanced the tax package’s other significant components. 
Those measures — expected to receive floor votes Monday in the House — would permanently increase the state’s business tax rate, impose a new sales tax on rented self-storage units, and add a new levy on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. 
The committee also voted out a bill to lift the cap on annual increases in property tax growth. 
Democrats plowed ahead on these multiple fronts without clarity on how Ferguson would respond if the bills reached his desk.
The first-term governor on Thursday called their $12 billion package “unsustainable” and “too risky,” citing unknowns about the economy and the flow of federal funding with the Trump Administration. Ferguson insisted again that a mix of progressive revenue and spending reductions is needed to resolve the budget issue, but stopped short of specifics.
He met virtually with Democratic leaders Thursday, but did not cite any specific taxes in the package he dislikes. 
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, who took part in the meeting, didn’t speculate on whether the bills passed Saturday would get signed.
“I can’t speak for the governor,” he said. “This is consistent with what we have talked with him about in terms of our approach on revenue.”
Tax time
When the session began, Democrats forecast the need for new and higher taxes to sustain public services at or near or existing levels. Saturday marked the first time any significant tax measure made it to the floor of either chamber. 
Senate Bill 5814, which passed 27-22, produces the most dollars, an estimated $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It applies the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the caucus leader on finance legislation, described the bill as making the state’s tax code “more appropriate for the 21st Century.”
“Our taxes fund core public services,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader for the Republican caucus, said there is “nothing modern about this bill.”
“This would be an unprecedented increase in the sales tax,” she said. “We were told that the wealthy need to pay what they owe but this bill hurts everyone.”
Democrats also pushed through Senate Bill 5813 to squeeze more money from the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. It would bring in $282 million in the coming budget and $561 million over four years, a fiscal analysis found. The bill passed 27-21.
Senate Bill 5794 advanced on a 26-22 vote. It revises or repeals a number of tax breaks. Republicans tried without success to preserve some, including exempting operators of self-service storage facilities from paying a business and occupation tax on the renting or leasing of individual units. Most storage unit users are not homeowners, they argued.
“This is a tax on renters,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.
‘There’s no need’
Pedersen said budget writers “have scrubbed and scrubbed” and come up with $7 billion in savings through cuts, delays and deferrals. He said bills like those Senate Democrats approved are needed for crucial programs related to health care, housing, child care and schools.
Republicans pushed back hard. 
“There’s no need for any of the tax increases,” said Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who led a GOP effort to craft an alternative budget proposal that doesn’t rely on tax hikes.
He lambasted a provision that requires businesses with $3 million or more in taxable retail sales next year to make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax to the state. This maneuver would pull more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
“This is completely a budget gimmick that should not be tolerated,” Gildon said.
In mid-afternoon, Senate Republicans attempted to pull their budget bill to the floor through a parliamentary move, but failed.
“It doesn’t play games and use ghost money,” Gildon said. “It is the only budget proposal that lives within its means.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1573-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-19 23:06:37.771023

(Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)Thousands of Coloradans gathered at the state Capitol in Denver on Saturday to attend the month’s second Hands Off! protest against the Trump administration’s policies regarding immigrants, civil rights and marginalized communities. 
The protest was organized by young people from groups like Women’s Strike, Raise Her Voice, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, according to co-organizer McKenzie Hales, 20. The Colorado State Patrol estimated about 3,000 people were in attendance as protesters began to march at 1:30 p.m. The previous Hands Off! rally in Denver on April 5 attracted more than 8,000 attendees. 
Similar protests happened in cities across Colorado, such as Boulder, Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and Fort Collins. Similar protests were planned throughout the country.
“We deserve a country that doesn’t just say the word ‘freedom’ but one that practices it,” Hales said.

Mandy Swartz, an organizer with Raise Her Voice, a group that teaches political skills to women and marginalized communities, told Colorado Newsline that including young people in the protest is a way to ensure the momentum continues. 
Swartz said she had several “doors slammed in (her) face” as a young organizer, and she wants to change that dynamic for today’s youths.  
“We need to pass the torch on to our youths,” Swartz said. “When we’re gone, we need our youths to carry this on.” 
  It was the second Hands Off! rally in Denver this month. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)
Protesters started gathering at the intersection of Lincoln Street and East 14th Avenue about 90 minutes before the protest began. Many carried upside-down American flags — a symbol of distress — and homemade signs calling for the protection of due process rights for legal immigrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration of President Donald Trump erroneously sent to prison in El Salvador without allowing him to have a court hearing. 
As the crowd grew, protest songs like “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, “Can You Get to That” by Funkadelic, and “Revolution” by The Beatles could be heard playing through loudspeakers. The smell of burning sage and marijuana hung in the air. Passersby honked car horns in a show of solidarity with the protesters. 
Police officers in unmarked cars drove down Lincoln Street to keep protesters on the sidewalks. Once the crowd became too large, police shut down the intersection and diverted traffic away from Lincoln Street.
Speakers highlighted the deportation proceedings against local labor organizer Jeanette Vizguerra as an example of the unfair treatment immigrants are receiving under Trump. Vizgeurra’s arrest drew widespread condemnation across the country, with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston likening it to “Putin-style political persecution.” 
Some also called on congressional and local lawmakers to repair the social contract for marginalized groups like people with disabilities, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. Others spoke in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and what they characterized as America’s complicity in the conflict. 
“Until we address and rebuild America’s foundation, this house will fall,” said Dr. Robert Davis (no relation to the author), an activist with the Denver Task Force to Reimagine Policing.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

(Photo via FIU)Florida International University’s police chief believes the university community would be best served by the department signing an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although the faculty is uneasy. 
During a Faculty Senate special meeting Friday, interim President Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor, and FIU Police Department Chief Alexander Casas fielded questions from faculty members about what a 287(g) agreement with ICE will mean for students and faculty, particularly ones fearing detainment.
Under the agreement, FIUPD officers could act as immigration enforcement officials to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
“If we have to deliver someone, we’re the ones you want to do it, because it will be done in the most FIU way, the most Panther way, we can think of,” Casas said. 
Casas signed the agreement with ICE, as have several other university police departments in the state, and is awaiting a response from the federal agency before officers can begin training. When it’s signed, Casas said, he will choose his “best officers” to be trained. 
“If I don’t sign that agreement, we open the door for other agencies who are on this agreement, whether they’re federal agencies in power to do so or state agencies directed by our governor or local agencies that have agreed,” Casas said. 
Casas told faculty he wants his department to have a say in how immigration enforcement goes at the South Florida institution.
“Once I deliver someone to Krome or turn them over to ICE, you’re right, I lose control. But, absent this agreement, I don’t even have input. At the very least, once they execute it, at least now I have input and my officers do have a little say in what could be the outcome,” Casas said.
“If it has to happen because there’s a warrant in the system, who do you want interacting with you? God, I hope you say it’s me,” Casas said. 
Nuñez said she spoke at length with Faculty Senate Chair Noël Barengo earlier in the week after he reached out. She added that she wants to make sure she is “constantly addressing concerns.”
Faculty Senate members were not so convinced. Florida universities have made national news for signing the agreement with ICE.
Students live in fear for their ability to remain in the United States, faculty members said. One professor shared about a student who is not a citizen who came to him worried after receiving a parking ticket. 
Juan Gómez, director of the Carlos Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, said students have approached him to say they are afraid to look up items on their computer. Some, in abusive relationships, are afraid to call police. 
“I don’t know the status of any of our students. PD does not have access to any of that information,” Casas said, adding that his department has to follow FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

Casas said he did not get a call from the governor encouraging him to seek a 287(g) agreement; instead, he approached Nuñez after conversations with other law enforcement convinced him it “really is with our best interest at heart.”
Faculty senators approved a resolution opposing the agreement, saying it “goes against the university’s values of truth in the pursuit, generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge, freedom of thought and expression, and respect for diversity and dignity of the individual.” The resolution called for the university to withdraw. 
Well into the two-hour meeting, Philip Carter, an FIU professor, remained unconvinced.
“It’s been good to hear you,” Carter said. “I haven’t heard anything that convinces me that this is a good agreement. It still sounds like a really bad agreement. I still worry about the safety of our students on campus who fear for their status and their safety. I worry, frankly, about all of us, I worry about faculty, I worry that there’s a slippery slope beneath us.”
Nuñez stressed that visa revocations and ICE agreements are different but sometimes get conflated. FIU has no control over visa revocations, she said. 
Earlier this week, FIU confirmed to the Phoenix that 18 students have had their visas revoked since Jan. 1. The University of Florida told the Phoenix that eight visas have been revoked; Florida State University, three.
Alana Greer, director of Community Justice Project, said the FIU 287(g) is “deeply unprecedented” and the “agenda behind relaunching these 287(g)’s is specifically engineered to break trust, to tear apart our communities and to get us to see our neighbors, our peers, our students as ‘other.’”
Greer referenced her involvement with a story the Phoenix reported on Thursday, when 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper as an “unauthorized alien” and held for ICE.

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While anniversary events are typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, Saturday’s remembrance was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.

Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a generation.
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995.
Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

The report, written by longtime natural resources manager John Tubbs, calls the financial implications of federal lands transfer “staggering and disproportionately impactful for a rural state with large swaths of national public lands.”
“The costs associated with maintaining national public lands at the state level — ranging from wildfire operations to the loss of essential federal funding for rural counties — would be far too great for Montana to bear per capita,” the report states. It amounts to an $8 billion “gamble on Montana’s future.” 
Tubbs, who authored the report with support from the Montana Wildlife Federation, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Mountain Mamas and the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, is the former director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation under Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.
The long simmering dispute over whether the federal government should relinquish lands managed by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture to individual states has been turned up at all levels, from the halls of Congress to Montana’s capitol.
The estimated roughly $8 billion increase to Montanan’s balance sheet would be primarily driven by the costs of managing the land, according to the report, including for wildfire, deferred maintenance backlogs, and abandoned mine reclamation.
Citing reports by the Legislative Fiscal Division, the report states that during the last 20 years, Montana has paid more than $2.3 billion in wildfire mitigation costs on federal land — comprising just 25% of total cost, as the federal government covers 75% of costs. 
A transfer of federal lands to state management would shift the cost of future wildland fire suppression to state taxpayers to the tune of $5.5 billion — the bulk of the total.
On a press call about the report, Tubbs pointed to the essential partnerships with federal agencies  — including the large fleets of firefighting aircraft operated by the Forest Service — and the difficulty in replicating that from the state or private industry. 
“That is untenable,” he said.
 Tubbs also focused on Payment in Lieu of Taxes funds the federal government disseminates. The PILT program channels money to rural counties with swaths of untaxable federal land to support vital services such as public safety, housing, social services and transportation. 
In fiscal year 2023, Montana counties received more than $40 million in PILT funds — and another $16 million from the similar Secure Rural Schools program — a loss the state likely couldn’t make up. 
Tubbs said such a loss would result in the largest “unfunded mandate” in state history, and “several of Montanaʼs counties would be bankrupt—- in particular, the 11 counties in which more than half of the acreage is owned by the federal government.”
The report also states that Montana would be on the hook for $623 million in deferred maintenance and repairs on current federal lands; between $474 million and $1 billion for reclamation work on the state’s 5,000 abandoned mines; and a 1,600% increase in grazing fees. 
 “The state simply cannot afford the responsibility of managing such vast swaths of land without significant financial strain,” the report concludes. 
Tubbs said the value of public lands goes far beyond the numbers, and supporters need to strengthen efforts. 
“The core value I think most of us find in public lands is there’s some landscape that means something to each of us,” he said on the press call. 

Discussions about the federal lands transfer came to the forefront in Washington D.C. and nationwide following statements by the Trump administration that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a federal budget in a series of late night votes, and one particular budget amendment saw Montana’s two Republican Senators buck their party. 
The amendment, brought by Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit. 
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy joined all Democrats in supporting the amendment, but it was defeated 51-49. 
In a similar vein, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montanan’s western representative, reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with a Democratic senator from New Mexico.
The provision would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service from selling or transferring “most public lands” except in specific circumstances. It also would require Congressional approval for disposals of publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres if accessible via a public waterway.
“In Montana, public lands are our way of life. It’s not just Yellowstone and Glacier, it’s also the BLM and Forest Service areas where a kid fills their first tag, a lake in the Beartooths that is the perfect picnic spot, and the trail just down the road that helps you clear your head after a long workday,” Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during Trump’s first term, said in a press release. “Public lands must remain public, and the federal government has a responsibility to manage and ensure access to those lands.”
Earlier this month, Montana’s eastern representative, Republican Troy Downing, signed on as a cosponsor to the legislation, as did Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson. 
In Helena this legislative session, Montana’s state lawmakers also got to offer their own takes on the issue thanks to a lawsuit filed by the State of Utah against the federal government in favor of land transfer.
The suit, which claimed federally-managed land infringed on the state’s sovereignty and sought a return of millions of acres, was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite that, freshman Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, introduced a resolution supporting Utah’s position.
While Millett stated House Resolution 24 did not concern Montana’s federal public lands, his comments were broadly applicable to all states. 
“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution authorizes the federal government to hold vast unreserved swaths of unreserved territory in perpetuity over the states’ express objection,” he told the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee during a hearing. “The U.S. generates significant revenue from these unappropriated lands — millions of dollars annually that would go toward our counties and schools. But instead, we get but a pittance, leftover crumbs from what should be our lands.”
The bill passed out of committee on partisan lines, but saw broad bipartisan opposition on the floor. 
“Montanans have overwhelmingly rejected transfer time and time again,” Rep. Debo Powers, D-Whitefish, told her colleagues during the debate. “In fact, 87 percent of Montana voters considered the conservation — not the transfer, but the conservation — of public land to be influential in their voting decisions. That’s why so many political candidates in Montana from every political party pledged to keep public lands in public hands.”
The bill failed to pass the House floor in a bipartisan 33-66 vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/52200523998_54a5016229_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 14:04:23.814161

(Adam Wesley/USA Today)ASHLAND, Wis. — In less than 10 years, three catastrophic floods ravaged northwestern Wisconsin and changed the way people think about water. 
The most severe, in July 2016, slammed Ashland with up to 10 inches of rain in less than a day — a month’s worth of rain fell in just two hours. As rivers swelled to record highs, major highways broke into pieces and culverts washed away. It took months for roads to reopen, with more than $41 million in damage across seven counties. 
The Marengo River, which winds through forests and farmland before meeting the Bad River that flows into Lake Superior, was hit hard during these historic deluges. Centuries earlier, the upper watershed would have held onto that water, but logging and agriculture left the river disconnected from its floodplain, giving the water nowhere safe to go. 
Today, the Marengo River stands as an example of a new kind of solution. Following the record floods, state leaders invested in opening up floodplains and restoring wetlands to relieve flooding. As the need to adapt to disasters grows more urgent, the Marengo River serves as an example that there’s a cheaper way to do so: using wetlands. 
“We can’t change the weather or the patterns… but we can better prepare ourselves,” said MaryJo Gingras, Ashland County’s conservationist. 
 This story is part of the series Down the Drain from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
Wetlands once provided more natural flood storage across Wisconsin and the Mississippi River Basin, soaking up water like sponges so it couldn’t rush further downstream. But about half of the country’s wetlands have been drained and filled for agriculture and development, and they continue to be destroyed, even as climate change intensifies floods.
As the federal government disposes of rules to protect wetlands, environmental advocates want to rewrite the ecosystem’s narrative to convince more people that restoration is worth it. 
Wetlands aren’t just pretty places, advocates argue, but also powerhouses that can save communities money by blunting the impact of flood disasters. A 2024 Wisconsin law geared at preventing such disasters before they happen, inspired by the wetland work in the Marengo River watershed, is going to test that theory. 
“Traditionally, the outreach has been, ‘We want to have wetlands out here because they’re good for ducks, frogs and pretty flowers,’” said Tracy Hames, executive director of the Wisconsin Wetlands Association. “What do people care about here? They care about their roads, their bridges, their culverts … how can wetlands help that?” 
Bipartisan bill posed wetlands as flood solution
Northern Wisconsin isn’t the only place paying the price for floods. Between 1980 and 2025, the U.S. was struck by 45 billion-dollar flood disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with a cumulative price tag of nearly $206 billion. Many parts of the vast Mississippi River Basin receive up to eight inches more rain annually than they did 50 years ago, according to a 2022 analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that analyzes climate science. 
Damaging floods are now so common in the states that border the Mississippi River, including Wisconsin, that the issue can’t be ignored, said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“Even if you don’t agree with certain (regulations) … we absolutely have to find ways to reduce damage,” Gentry said.
Former Wisconsin state Rep. Loren Oldenburg, a Republican who served a flood-prone district in southwest Wisconsin until he lost the seat last year, was interested in how wetlands could help.
Oldenburg joined forces with Republican state Sen. Romaine Quinn, who represents northern Wisconsin and knew of the work in the Marengo River watershed. The lawmakers proposed a grant program for flood-stricken communities to better understand why and where they flood and restore wetlands in areas that need the help most. 
 
Jennifer Western Hauser, policy liaison at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to advocate for the bill. She emphasized problems that might get their attention — related to transportation, emergency services, insurance, or conservation — that wetland restoration could solve. She said she got a lot of head-nods as she explained that the cost of continually fixing a washed-out culvert could vanish from storing and slowing floodwaters upstream. 
“These are issues that hit all over,” she said. “It’s a relatable problem.”   
  State Highway 13, a major north-south route in Wisconsin, collapsed in rural Ashland County in 2016 after a massive rainstorm caused area rivers to swell to record highs. The county used state funds to restore wetlands, hoping to prove that they’re a natural flooding solution.(MaryJo Gingras/Ashland County Land & Water Conservation Dept.)
The bill passed unanimously and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April 2024. Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved $2 million for the program in the state’s most recent budget. 
Twenty-three communities applied for the first round of grant funding, which offered two types of grants — one to help assess flood risk, and another grant to help build new wetlands to reduce that risk. Eleven communities were funded, touching most corners of the state, according to Wisconsin Emergency Management, which administered the grants. 
Brian Vigue, freshwater policy director for Audubon Great Lakes, said the program shows Wisconsinites have come a long way in how they think about wetlands since 2018, when the state government made it easier for developers to build in them. 
There’s an assumption that wetland restoration comes only at the expense of historically lucrative land uses like agriculture or industry, making it hard to gain ground, Vigue said. But when skeptics understand the possible economic benefits, it can change things. 
“When you actually find something with the return on investment and can prove that it’s providing these benefits … we were surprised at how readily people that you’d assume wouldn’t embrace a really good, proactive wetland conservation policy, did,” he said. 
Private landowners need to see results
About three-quarters of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are on privately owned land, including areas that were targeted for restoration in the Marengo River watershed. That means before any restoration work begins, the landowner must be convinced that the work will help, not hurt them. 
For projects like this to work, landowner goals are a priority, said Kyle Magyera, local government outreach specialist at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, because “they know their property better than anyone else.”
Farmers, for example, can be leery that beefing up wetlands will take land out of production and hurt their bottom line, Magyera said. 
In the Marengo watershed, Gingras worked with one landowner who had farmland that wasn’t being used. They created five new wetlands across 10 acres that have already decreased sediment and phosphorus runoff from entering the river. And while there hasn’t been a flood event yet, Gingras expects the water flows to be slowed substantially.
This work goes beyond restoring wetland habitat, Magyera said, it’s about reconnecting waterways. In another project, Magyera worked on a private property where floods carved a new channel in a ravine that funneled the water faster downstream. The property now has log structures that mimic beaver dams to help slow water down and reconnect these systems.

Now that the first round of funding has been disbursed in Wisconsin’s grant program, grantees across the state are starting work on their own versions of natural flood control, like that used in Marengo. 
In Emilie Park, along the flood-prone East River in Green Bay, a project funded by the program will create 11 acres of new wetlands. That habitat will help store water and serve as an eco-park where community members can stroll through the wetland on boardwalks.
In rural Dane County, about 20 miles from the state capital, a stretch of Black Earth Creek will be reconnected to its floodplain, restoring five and a half acres of wetlands and giving the creek more room to spread out and reduce flood risk. The creek jumped its banks during a near record-breaking 2018 rainstorm, washing out two bridges and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
Voluntary program could be of interest elsewhere
Nature-based solutions to flooding have been gaining popularity along the Mississippi River. Wisconsin’s program could serve as a “national model” for how to use wetlands to promote natural flood resilience, Quinn wrote in a 2023 newspaper editorial supporting the bill.
Kyle Rorah, regional director of public policy for the Great Lakes/Atlantic region of Ducks Unlimited, said he’s talking about the Wisconsin grant program to lawmakers in other states in the upper Midwest, and that he sees more appetite for this model than relying on the federal government to protect wetlands.  
And Vigue has found that stakeholders in industries like fishing, shipping and recreation are receptive to using wetlands as infrastructure. 
But Gentry cautioned that voluntary restoration can only go so far, because it “still allows status-quo development and other related patterns to continue.”
Still, as the federal government backs off of regulation, Gentry said she expects more emphasis on the economic value of wetlands to drive protection. 
Some of that is already happening. A 2024 analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that wetlands save Wisconsin and the upper Midwest nearly $23 billion a year that otherwise would be spent combating flooding. 
“Every level of government is looking at ways to reduce costs so it doesn’t increase taxes for their constituents,” Gingras said. 
John Sabo, director of the ByWater Institute at Tulane University, said as wetlands prove their economic value in reducing flood damage costs, taxpayers will see their value. 
“You have to think about (wetlands) as providing services for people,” Sabo said, “if you want to get people on the other side of the aisle behind the idea (of restoring them).” 
And although the Wisconsin grant program is small-scale for now, he said if other states bordering the Mississippi River follow its lead, it could reduce flooding across the region.
“If all upstream states start to build upstream wetlands,” he said, “that has downstream impacts.”

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Taiwan Office of the President photo)JUNEAU — Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy flew to Taiwan last month to pitch business and government leaders on Alaska’s state-sponsored liquefied natural gas export project.
The same day Dunleavy and other Alaska officials arrived in Taipei on the unannounced trip, his office received an email from China’s vice consul in San Francisco, Ba Yanfeng. The consulate was aware that Dunleavy was leading a trip to the “province” of Taiwan, and Chinese government officials wanted a meeting with his chief of staff, Ba said.
Dunleavy had stepped into a simmering geopolitical conflict — an issue that China’s government describes as the most important and sensitive in its relationship with the U.S.
 
Take a trip to the Asian island that could play a role in Alaska’s future

	China claims Taiwan as its own territory and regularly conducts military drills nearby — including some that have simulated blockades and involved firing missiles over the island. 
The U.S. doesn’t officially recognize Taiwan’s independence. But it’s a longtime ally, sells arms to the government and has committed in legislation to support the island’s defense.

	In a formal follow-up note, the Chinese government said Dunleavy’s trip “sends a very wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,” and it urged the governor “to correct such mistakes and avoid their recurrence.”
But Dunleavy, in an interview, said he was undeterred. 
“I don’t allow myself to get pushed around by too many entities or people,” he said.
Alaska does significant trade with China, namely in seafood products, though that’s diminished since President Donald Trump began levying tariffs during his first term. Still, Alaska exports more than $500 million in seafood products to China each year.
But amid China’s broader, ongoing trade war with America, experts said it’s unlikely that the country will target Alaska with retaliatory action even if the LNG project moves forward with Taiwanese partnership.
“I think this is probably fairly low on China’s list of priorities. They have a lot on their plate,” said David Sacks, an expert on Taiwan and China and a fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Sacks described the Chinese correspondence with Dunleavy’s office as “pretty pro forma,” even if it sounds strident. He also said there’s nothing unusual about an American governor or legislator traveling to Taiwan — and he noted that other states, like Arizona, have done robust business with Taiwanese firms without prompting a backlash from China.
“I think it would be fairly unprecedented for the Chinese to take aggressive action here that specifically targets Alaska,” he said.
Dunleavy’s trip to Taiwan last month came amid a new push by his administration to recruit investment in the $44 billion LNG development. Top Trump administration officials have also been touting the project to Asian allies, and a private firm, Glenfarne, has taken over leadership of the development from a state agency.
Dunleavy’s trip also included stops in Thailand, South Korea and Japan, where he met with politicians and corporate executives.
But his Taiwan visit garnered the most headlines. In Taipei, Dunleavy met for an hour with President Lai Ching-te and held a lunch with the vice president, according to his schedule. He also met with officials from Taipower, the country’s primary electric utility, and from the state-owned oil and gas company, CPC.

	CPC has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy one-third of the LNG produced by the Alaska project, and the letter also contemplates investment in the development, according to a description by officials from the state’s gas pipeline agency. The letter itself is confidential, according to the agency.
Promoters of Alaska’s LNG project, including Dunleavy and Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, say that investment in and purchases of gas from the development can provide Asian allies with a secure source of fuel — with a shorter transit time than shipments from the Middle East. Importing Alaska gas would also lower Taiwan’s trade deficit with the U.S., which could curry favor with Trump.
But it’s still far from certain that the project will be built. Alaska’s government has spent decades studying construction of a gas line, and the current iteration of the project has been dogged by projected high costs.
Taiwanese investment in the project, and any American engagement with the island’s government, also risk pushback from China.
In a prepared statement to Northern Journal, the spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington, D.C., Liu Pengyu, called Taiwan “an inalienable part of China’s territory” and urged “the relevant U.S. side” to cease all forms of official contact with Taiwan. 
“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the United States and Taiwan, under any pretext or in any capacity,” the statement said.
Dunleavy, in the interview, said he did not know how the Chinese government became aware of his visit to the island. 
They “wanted me to abort the trip, apparently,” he said.
Dunleavy would not directly say whether he recognizes Taiwan’s sovereignty, calling that “the biggest loaded question.”
“These are human beings, 23 million people. They would like to have a great relationship with the United States,” he said. “We want to sell energy. They want energy. I’d love to partner.”
Alaska has a long history of trade with Taiwan, and other state officials have traveled there in recent years, including two state senators in 2024. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski has visited more than a dozen times, including as an observer of one of Taiwan’s presidential elections.
The Chinese response to Dunleavy’s trip, first reported by conservative news site Must Read Alaska, is “pretty boilerplate,” said Sacks, the expert from the Council of Foreign Relations. 
But its “ominous” language could also be an attempt by the Chinese to ward off business dealings in Taiwan by an American official who’s not well-versed in the island’s tense political dynamics, Sacks added, in comments that were echoed by a statement from the U.S. Department of State.
“Around the world, including in the United States, the Chinese Communist Party attempts to leverage economic and diplomatic pressure to try to prevent officials from interacting with Taiwan,” the statement said. “Robust cooperative activities with Taiwan, including by state leaders, are consistent with U.S. policy.” 
The statement added that the letter of intent from CPC “is another example of the longstanding, deep, and growing trade and investment ties between the United States and Taiwan, which create American jobs and mutual prosperity.”
Sacks said he sees the LNG project as being in America’s interests — both because of its potential to reduce Taiwan’s trade deficit and to give its people a more reliable supply of energy. 
But while Sacks described the risk of repercussions to Alaska as low, he also wouldn’t completely rule them out. He pointed to a recent move by China instructing the nation’s airlines to stop accepting deliveries of jets made by Boeing. 
“The context might change now, because the Chinese are looking for ways — in a way that they weren’t before — to punish the Trump administration for the tariffs,” Sacks said. “I wouldn’t foreclose that.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
In Iowa, 14% of the state’s K-12 budget was funded by the federal government in 2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, with a total of $1.13 billion.
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”

(Photo by Lanny Hartmann)In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore joined Maryland to California’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions by phasing out gasoline vehicle sales by 2035. Barely two years later, he signed an executive order delaying penalties for these Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals, blaming insufficient charging infrastructure.
The real culprit? A large portion of Maryland’s public chargers are utility-owned and routinely broken — mocking the drivers who rely on them and the ratepayers who funded them.
Since 2019, the Maryland Public Service Commission has let utilities like BGE, Pepco, Delmarva Power, Potomac Edison and SMECO operate public EV chargers in a pilot program now nearing its end. BGE alone spent $15 million installing chargers at libraries, parks and government buildings.
The utilities vowed these stations would match the reliability of their electric grid. Instead, they’ve delivered a charging disaster. Now, they want four more years — and more ratepayer cash — to keep it limping along.

The utilities’ pitch in 2018 was simple: Give us millions, and we’ll build a dependable electric vehicle network. But drivers know the truth: These chargers are often down. Worse, utilities outsourced most operations to third-party contractors. When a charger fails, EV drivers don’t call BGE for a quick fix — they’re stuck dialing a “network provider,” where complaints vanish into a virtual black hole, sometimes taking months to resolve. This isn’t service; it’s abandonment.
In 2023, the General Assembly demanded accountability, passing House Bill 834, the Electric Vehicle Charging Reliability Act, requiring 97% uptime, backed by quarterly reports and penalties for failure. Two years on, the Public Service Commission has yet to see those reports. Drivers, meanwhile, feel reliability worsening.
Moore’s executive order, citing the very infrastructure utilities failed to deliver, only deepens the distrust — easing pressure on automakers instead of fixing the public charging networks.
Fed up, I joined 12 other Maryland EV drivers to survey every fast charger statewide. Our Maryland Fast Charger Survey visited 304 locations, testing over 1,000 ports.
Tesla, running more than half of Maryland’s fast chargers, delivered 99.6% availability — 541 of 543 ports worked. BGE? A measly 33% (30 of 90 chargers operational). Delmarva Power’s Eastern Shore network was the worst at 31% (4 of 13). These aren’t chargers; They’re proof utilities can’t deliver.
Now, utilities propose bigger budgets for a second phase of the pilot program, funneling more money to contractors for obsolete chargers. Unlike Tesla’s stations—built near 24-hour stores with 8 to 16 plugs pumping up to 325 kW—most utility chargers are stuck at 50 kW, often with just one or two ports. They’re not at vibrant hubs but in desolate corners of parking lots, like behind state office buildings.
Why pour millions into slow, outdated chargers nobody wants to use?
Moore’s order admits the infrastructure isn’t ready, but after six years, that’s no excuse — it’s a failure of leadership. Utilities have had time and money to build a network that works. Instead, they’ve squandered trust and dollars.
The Public Service Commission must end this failed experiment, redirect funds to proven models like supporting commercial charger programs, and demand Moore recommit to Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals with infrastructure that delivers. Marylanders deserve better than broken chargers and weak promises. It’s time to pull the plug.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54447410884_ae7daf624d_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-19 09:02:08.318787

(Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Five years of COVID-era relief for federally-insured mortgages has helped millions of American homeowners retain their properties, while artificially inflating home prices and leading to the potential for Bubble 2.0, insist some experts who are hailing a decision from President Donald Trump’s administration, announced Tuesday, to end one program in September.
The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market.
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”

Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units.
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company.
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…”
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report.
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via federal relief programs in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders.
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance.
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months.
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.”
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected.
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email.
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands.
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs.












“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008.”

FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office.
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims.
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers.
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.”
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.”
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”

Allen, reading letters from students he said support the requirement, spoke at length as Senate Republicans were filibustering their own bills to keep Democrats from speaking. Democratic senators in a committee hearing in early April said that it would require students to be exposed to parts of the song, particularly the third stanza, which critics have said is an attack on Black Americans who escaped slavery by joining the British Army.

Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said after the bill’s passage that it potentially violates children’s constitutional rights, particularly free speech.
“When you start talking about fundamental rights. I think that’s going to be something that’s going to be challenged in courts too, in terms of whether or not — the constitutionality of — can you make kids listen to that on a daily basis, who may not want to and refuse,” Singleton said.
He also opposed making it a constitutional amendment, saying it would be “a forever permanent piece of law,” which he said was unnecessary. He said lawmakers should instead be focused on creating jobs and improving education in the state.
“I, too, am America, but do I have to love something that talks about me and the history of my slavery, that degrades me and my people? No, I don’t. So why make children have to sing that in school?” Singleton asked.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.












The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology




Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)A creative plan in the Washington Legislature to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers appears to be a pipe dream, for this year at least. 
With just over a week until the scheduled end of the legislative session, the state Senate’s bipartisan proposal to borrow up to $5 billion to eliminate culverts faces, well, barriers on several fronts. 
Cities and counties fear missing out on state dollars for water, sewer and other projects that would be diverted to repay the culvert-removal bonds. 
And the governor’s office says the plan is coming at a bad time, given broad economic uncertainty.
The measure looked to help fulfill the state’s obligations under a 2013 federal injunction that the U.S. Supreme Court later upheld.
A judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, typically pipes under roads or other infrastructure meant to allow water to flow. The judge’s order forced the state to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
The target has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
The state’s transportation department has estimated needing to address another 300 barriers to hit the benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million.
So last year, state officials returned to court to acknowledge they couldn’t meet the goal, as project costs have skyrocketed, and new barriers have been found.
The state and the 21 tribes that brought the original lawsuit are now going to mediation to potentially figure out a new path, recognizing Washington’s financial reality. 
Lawmakers hoped the cash infusion would show a good-faith effort to comply with the order as mediation begins. But opposition to the bond proposal appears insurmountable. 
“The state obviously has an obligation to meet,” said Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, the House’s capital budget lead. “The question is how.”
The maneuver
The state’s transportation budget has traditionally paid for culvert projects. 
But like the state’s operating budget, transportation faces a major shortfall over the next few years. And the capital budget for construction projects is healthier, so senators moved the culvert funding over. 
This allowed the Senate transportation budget writers to cut in half their projected $8 billion shortfall over the next six years.
The transportation budget proposal from House Democrats does not include such a funding flip, instead earmarking more than $5 billion over the current budget and the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination. The two chambers are currently negotiating over transportation funding.
The $5 billion in new bonds included in Senate Bill 5804, unveiled late last month, wouldn’t have to go toward state culvert removals specifically. The money could be used for both local and state projects identified as necessary through mediation. 
Even after the state removes its culverts, other downstream and upstream barriers continue to block fish passage and thwart Washington’s progress. 
Lawmakers looked to repay the bonds with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities that usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. 
Enter the first concern: Local governments worry the redirection would threaten ongoing state money specifically set aside for their public works projects.  
The proposal’s supporters take issue with that critique. 
Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said “some people are screaming wolf,” noting the capital budget proposal he helped write backfills the hole in public works money with $150 million in other bonds, for a total earmark of $250 million.
But Gov. Bob Ferguson has also snubbed the scheme. 
A letter from his budget director tells lawmakers that “given market uncertainty and volatile interest rates, this is not the time to explore a novel form of bonding outside of the state’s constitutional debt limit.”
The bonds the bill authorizes are separate from the “general obligation” bonds the state otherwise commonly uses. The usual bonds have low interest rates because they’re backed by the “full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state,” under the state Constitution. The proposed bonds are not, so they would carry higher borrowing costs.
The input disappointed Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. 
“My hope would’ve been that the governor would’ve been more enthused about this path forward,” she said, noting Ferguson was attorney general when the court case was decided.
Estimates from the state treasurer’s office also raised doubts that the utility tax could even generate the revenue necessary to service $5 billion in new debt.
Schoesler said he’s waiting for his colleagues to offer an alternative solution to what he described as “one of the biggest financial challenges” facing the state. 
“Show me a better idea,” he said.

[…]","Billy Long speaks during a press conference before filing for to be on the ballot in the Missouri GOP Senate primary on Feb. 22, 2022, in Jefferson City (Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent).Former Missouri Congressman Billy Long received $137,000 in campaign contributions — just enough to pay off a personal loan to his campaign — soon after he was tapped to lead the Internal Revenue Service.
 Some of the donations are connected to companies that will be policed by the agency Long has been nominated to run.
According to recently filed financial disclosures, which were first reported on by the investigative journalism site The Lever, Long only raised roughly $36,000 in the last two years. 
He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes. 
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri. 
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment. 
Billy Long, Trump’s nominee to lead IRS, touts credential tax experts say is dubious

After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt. 
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs. 
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.  
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Yet, all children and families are stretched thin, doing their best in systems that weren’t built for everyone to succeed—especially those who have been historically left behind.
Child maltreatment is a preventable, solvable, public issue when we invest in support and services for families when they need them. But for every $10 the U.S. spends on child welfare, only $1.50 goes toward primary prevention. That means most funding goes toward reacting after abuse or neglect has already happened—when investing earlier could strengthen families and give all children the nurturing, positive childhoods they deserve.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month and it’s a time to promote the positive solutions that strengthen families and build strong foundations for children. This year’s campaign theme is Powered by Hope, Strengthened by Prevention. HOPE stands for Healthy Outcomes from Positive Experiences. Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are experiences in childhood that build a child’s sense of belonging and connection. Studies indicate that the absence of positive experiences has a bigger impact on our health and wellbeing than the presence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
And we do feel hopeful this Child Abuse Prevention Month.
North Carolina Governor Josh Stein recently proposed over half a billion dollars in targeted tax relief to help working families cover the high costs of child care and other essential expenses that come with raising children, including:

Working families tax credit – 20% of federal Earned Income Tax Credit, worth up to $1,600
Child Tax Credit – Up to $300 for family of four
Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit – up to $600 for family of four
Back to school tax holiday

These proposals from the Governor are aligned with Positive Childhood Alliance North Carolina’s policy priorities and the positive experiences we hope to grow for all North Carolina children and families.
Just like no family can do it alone, neither can one single organization or agency. We urge the community to let your legislators know how these investments can strengthen families and prevent child abuse. It takes all of us—families, communities, policymakers, and organizations working together in partnership by:

Focusing on community-based solutions, such as local organizations like Family Resource Centers supporting families where they live.
Connecting families with support systems and building networks to support families and strengthen communities.
Advocating for policy change with programs and policies that help all children and families thrive– like affordable childcare, paid leave, and financial stability.

When parents and caregivers are overloaded with stress from financial insecurity, lack of health care, unstable housing, or the high cost of childcare, it’s like a car carrying too much weight—eventually, it breaks down. That overload of stress can then lead to a cascade of other problems including substance use, depression, and mental illness, some of the other major risk factors for maltreatment.
We must advance policies and practices that create the conditions proven by research to reduce the risk of maltreatment—because responding after harm has occurred is not enough. Addressing root causes by providing concrete support for parents is one of five protective factors proven to lower the risk of child maltreatment. Solutions such as paid family leave, housing assistance, and affordable childcare lightens the load and better equips parents to ensure their children’s well-being.
In addition, research shows that for every $1,000 that states invest in families living in poverty, Child Protective Service rates, foster care entries, and child fatalities drop. To reduce the number of children entering our child welfare system, which is also stressed and overloaded, we must invest in creating positive environments and experiences for families so that their children can thrive.
The bottom line: financial stability is foundational. By ensuring all families have access to support before challenges become crises, we can create a future filled with hope and opportunity. That’s good public policy and will create a healthier, more prosperous future for us all.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Postive-Childhood-Alliance-1024x459.png,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Therefore, the relevant question we must ask ourselves writ large is this: is our goal as a society true justice or simply punishment? 
Research by pioneering psychologists like Erikson and Piaget is so respected that it is routinely taught in psychology textbooks. Although not indicated by name, that foundational research and the court’s indication that the neuroplasticity of a developing brain before the age of 25, as well as relevant case law, was instrumental in the decision to disallow the affected age group to be automatically sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder (building on the 2022 decision regarding 18-year-olds).  
Utilizing prevailing research as a component of legal decision-making is a win for logic, reasoning, and science but the dissenting opinion of the decision cannot be ignored. The dissent, penned by Chief Justice Clement, indicated that first degree murder is a grave offense, and, a “…punishment of great severity is therefore proportionate,” while also indicating that the majority decision focuses on examining the offender and not the offense.  
Therein lies the issue with what we tell ourselves, as a society, about how and why we incarcerate and hints at the reasoning behind the United States leading all developed nations in per capita prison populations.  Especially in Michigan. 
This is all rooted in the notion that we, as a society, view ourselves as a rehabilitative one that values change and personal responsibility… in theory. Faith-based and popular media stories routinely feature redemption arcs of men and women that have committed heinous crimes and acts but can find a place in society through change and sacrifice.  
The belief in these redemption arcs seem to end with Michigan’s prison population wherein, much like the dissenting opinion, a blanket punitive sentence is applied regardless of the rehabilitative potential of the offender. In large part based off the “tough on crime” rhetoric of the 1990s, the state is left with a prison population serving long sentences far greater than the majority of other states. The Council on Criminal Justice (2023) indicated that 66% of Michigan’s prison population is serving 10+ years based on 2016 releases and the average sentence is 20 years, which is much higher than most other states.  
It appears that we have not only given up the idea of rehabilitative incarceration but moved in the exact opposite direction. To date, the youngest ‘juvenile lifer’ in the state was Dontez Tillman. He was sentenced in 2011 at the age of 17 to life without parole for participating in the murder of a homeless man with friends where he was first arrested and in the system at 14. In 2025, he is now 30 years old. While Tillman was subsequently resentenced in 2015 to a term of 32-and-a-half to 60 years in prison, the earliest he could be set free is 2041.
If we continue to apply that blanket approach to sentencing and noting that only these long sentences can keep our communities safe, then are we to throw out the entirety of research on the matter, our purported belief in the ability for one to redeem themselves, and basic common sense? 
Although I have never met Mr. Tillman, I have encountered and worked in an academic and forensic setting with many men and women who are currently serving very long sentences for crimes committed in their youth. I would hazard that Mr. Tillman is a functionally different person than he was when he was in his adolescence. Recrimination and remorse are routinely part of an incarcerated person’s daily existence, but the system that we have in place does not have a mechanism to recognize that. If one can grow, learn, and become fundamentally changed in one environment, then that should apply to all environments… including our prison system. 
In addition, think of the standard brain development the court used to base the recent decision on. Brain development and socialization are not standardized, of course, but Piaget, Erikson, and others have mapped out general stages. However, some differences are common. This is under the assumption that development and socialization take place in an average society. What if, like Mr. Tillman and many others, that development takes place in a prison environment? 
There are no predictors on what incarceration does on brain development for adolescents, but the effects of incarceration on adults are startling. A rehabilitant society would never entertain the thought of allowing young people who have made terrible mistakes and choices to simply rot and, essentially, grow up in one of the most violent and hopeless landscapes imaginable.  
Yet, fear still pervades our societal view, and that fear means we must do whatever possible to ensure our safety. Just as long as that safety does not involve investing in the future of groups of people that we have already labeled as ‘monsters’ or ‘evil’. The use of those terms is low-hanging fruit for fearmongers, allowing an arbitrary, and largely fantastical, definition of a word to become the reasoning for disallowing a person to grow beyond what is ofttimes a single, horrible decision on a single, horrible day.  
As it stands, long prison sentences do nothing to actually make Michigan safer. They are not a deterrent to crime, quite obviously, and only function to punish without recourse. We only talk the rehabilitative game. 
Kudos to the Michigan Supreme Court for the current decision, but it does little to address the larger, systemic issues in sentencing in Michigan. As a society, allowing this decision to alleviate whatever pangs of guilt are felt whenever we see that our courts, much like an overzealous bartender, over serve justice to the cheers of voters is dangerous. I fear most people would agree with Chief Justice Clement’s dissent.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for HHS secretary, appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)After the Senate voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, supporters of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement cheered at having a champion in the federal government.
Now the grumbling has begun. Some of Kennedy’s allies say he’s become almost inaccessible since his confirmation and complain that he’s made glacial progress advancing MAHA goals, such as halting mRNA-based COVID shots and removing fluoride from drinking water.
The fractures underscore the clash between Kennedy’s movement and President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Kennedy is pulled between his supporters who want swift action to disrupt traditional health care and Trump, who is focused more on tariffs and increasing deportations than on disease, according to four people close to Kennedy who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Many of the priorities driving Kennedy’s MAHA program are not top priorities of his boss.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Kennedy’s capacity to navigate those tensions has been further strained by a measles outbreak and the threat of a bird flu pandemic, the people said.
Some of his deputies are still being vetted and other key positions remain unfilled. That, along with resignations of top HHS leaders and sweeping staffing reductions, has created a gap in expertise. Kennedy sometimes calls close informal advisers on the run before meetings, and the crises have put him in a reactionary stance, working on weekends and marshaling staff for Sunday meetings, according to the people.
More churn is coming because of an HHS reorganization set to eliminate about 20,000 jobs, including a 19% cut to the workforce at the FDA, which oversees food, nutrition, and vaccines.
HHS spokespeople didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
To be sure, Kennedy’s ascendance represents a breakthrough for the MAHA movement, a broad collection of gadflies, groups, and wellness influencers who extol raw milk, metabolic health, and sustainable farming while lambasting Big Pharma, vaccines, and processed foods.
The coming months will test Kennedy’s ability to juggle the challenges and achieve Trump’s goals without losing the support of MAHA adherents, especially special interest and advocacy groups that helped him reach his influential perch overseeing one of the nation’s largest federal agencies. HHS, with a budget of almost $2 trillion, includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
But the MAHA goals aren’t top agenda items for GOP voters, who tend to be focused more on the price of eggs than whether they’re organic.
The MAHA faithful “expect action” but their to-do list is not necessarily a high priority for voters or lawmakers, said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. “And should there be a big measles outbreak or avian flu, it would hurt the White House if there was a big conflict over vaccines going on,” he said.
An additional challenge for Kennedy is that not all MAHA and MAGA goals overlap. Trump wants to slash the workforce, which Kennedy has embraced. But fulfilling MAHA wishes will require more regulation, which runs counter to MAGA dogma favoring a smaller federal government.
MAHA wants fluoride out of water because followers say it leads to lower IQ levels in children, as well as arthritis and bone cancer. Kennedy said on X that fluoride is dangerous and that the Trump administration would recommend it be removed from America’s drinking water. Fluoridated water is credited for vastly reducing rates of tooth decay in the U.S. In 2015, the CDC called water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, and only 15% of Americans think fluoride is harmful or detrimental to the public, based on a poll in January by market research company Ipsos.

MAHA adherents believe in the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and Kennedy just tapped a vaccine opponent to work on a study on possible connections. In fact, HHS has launched an effort that Kennedy said will determine by September what has caused the “autism epidemic.” Many autism researchers say this timeline sows doubts about the study’s seriousness. Most voters support vaccines and believe in their benefits. Eight in 10 parents with children under age 18 say they normally keep them up to date with recommended childhood vaccines, according to a KFF poll in January.
And MAHA wants to replace seed oils, which the movement’s followers claim without evidence are unhealthy, with animal fats such as beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat, which can contribute to high cholesterol and heart disease. Only 13% of Americans believe seed oils are unhealthy to consume, based on a poll by the industry-backed International Food Information Council.
Perhaps no goal is more important to many MAHA followers, however, than banning the mRNA technology behind covid vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer.
“The big threat is that we still have covid-19 vaccines on the market,” said Peter McCullough, a former cardiologist who has been criticized for spreading covid misinformation and has informally advised Kennedy. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate; I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?”
The FDA says COVID shots are safe. They are credited for saving millions of lives worldwide during the pandemic, and two NIH-funded scientists who advanced mRNA technology were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2023.
Yanking authority for mRNA-based covid vaccines could backfire because Trump sees “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal effort to develop the shots, as one of his signature achievements, according to one of the people close to Kennedy. And it would have been impolitic to take action before the confirmation of an FDA commissioner, the person said. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, was confirmed on March 25 to the post.
Kennedy also isn’t calling all the shots. He was initially unaware of the appointment of Gerald Parker, a veterinarian who recently chaired an NIH advisory board, to head the White House’s pandemic office, according to one of the people.
Kennedy did choose Susan Monarez, a former deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, as acting CDC director. Trump nominated her for Senate confirmation to lead the agency on March 24. Kennedy felt she had worked well with Trump’s job-cutting Department of Government Efficiency and did a great job in her acting director position, one of the people close to him said.
Kennedy is also in a difficult position regarding Trump’s Make America Healthy Again commission, which Kennedy chairs. The panel’s charge to investigate and deliver an action plan on the nation’s decades-long increase in chronic illness, with a special emphasis on children, is a clear pitch to the MAHA movement. But Trump has told Kennedy, according to one of the people, that he wants to see measurable progress in a year to 18 months — which is hard both to define and to achieve.
While Kennedy is a scion of the country’s most famous Democratic family, he is widely distrusted in the medical community because of his fringe views on vaccines and his rejection of established science. Since taking office, he has tried to cultivate relationships with MAGA-leaning state officials, including West Virginia’s governor, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And his alliance with Trump is new. When Kennedy was running for president in 2024, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say, “Kennedy is a Radical Left Democrat, and always will be!!!” — though Trump’s administration includes other onetime adversaries such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Many of Kennedy’s nutrition and health goals would require regulation, which clash with Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda and his focus on a lean federal government.
Meanwhile, he’s relied on his principal deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, a longtime Kennedy aide who has taken on the role of traffic cop in the department. He’s also leaned on HHS chief of staff Heather Flick Melanson for expertise. She was a senior adviser to former HHS Secretary Alex Azar in Trump’s first term.
Kennedy’s close circle of informal advisers includes nontraditional doctors, fellow vaccine opponents, media personalities, and self-appointed health gurus. Some have gained unprecedented influence and access to the innermost workings of federal health agencies.
Calley Means, for example, is a Kennedy ally whose business sells wellness products such as saunas and supplements. His statements have dismayed some scientists, such as when he called covid vaccine mandates for children a “war crime” and said without evidence that “metabolically healthy” people don’t die from covid. In March, Means joined the White House as a special government employee and MAHA adviser.
Others in Kennedy’s orbit include Del Bigtree, a television producer who founded the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network, and some officials from the previous Trump administration. Aaron Siri, a lawyer for Kennedy, is no longer involved in vetting candidates for HHS positions, one of the people said.
“‘Nontraditional’ as a description for these people is not enough. We’re talking about beyond the outer fringes of medicine,” said Irwin Redlener, senior adviser for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, of Kennedy’s inner circle. “This faux expertise is really dangerous.”
Even as some MAHA adherents press for swifter action, Kennedy’s recent comments and actions suggest public health ideas once dismissed as fringe or unscientific now have an advocate at HHS.
Kennedy claimed without evidence that cod liver oil is an effective treatment for measles. He’s suggested letting the bird flu virus rip unchecked through infected chicken flocks even though scientists say that could unleash dangerous mutations.
And he’s backed cellphone bans in schools, saying phones cause cancer in kids. Most studies have found no such link.

Matthew Ariwoola, 32, was a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, scheduled to graduate in December. But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola he could not continue studying and teaching due to a change in his immigration status.
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin granted a temporary order late Friday to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
In the order, which applies for two weeks, the judge wrote the government should not stop Ariwoola from “continuing to pursue his academic and employment pursuits that he is authorized to pursue.”
Ariwoola is one in a wave of more than 1,000 international students at colleges nationwide suddenly facing the possibility of arrest and deportation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the Trump administration terminated their student visas.
In South Carolina, at least a dozen USC students, a pair of Furman University students, and some students at Clemson University have had their student visas revoked or records terminated without warning, according to Allen Chaney, the legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina who is representing Ariwoola. (Chaney said those are the students his organization knows about; there could be more.)
“Matthew is yet another victim of the Trump administration’s haphazard and flagrantly unconstitutional dragnet of our international students,” Chaney said. “It’s hard to see how ejecting a hardworking and law-abiding doctoral student is anything but the product of an unmasked hatred of non-Americans. No one is better off if Matthew is deported, no one.”
U.S. Senate GOP wants mass deportations to ‘start early’ next year, Graham says

International students enter the United States most commonly through the F-1 student visa program and are monitored through a federal database, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
Once a student is granted a visa and residency status, they can typically stay in the U.S. even if that visa expires as long as they remain enrolled full time in school and aren’t convicted of a violent crime. There are also restrictions on off-campus jobs they’re authorized to take.
Ariwoola was researching ways to make medications more effective and teaching four chemistry courses at USC. He had been supporting his family through the stipend he receives from the university. Now he won’t be able to pay rent and could end up homeless, the ACLU of SC wrote.
Chaney said the federal immigration agency gave his client no warning that it intended to terminate his record.
The only reason listed in the federal database: “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”
“There’s no process, no notice, they’re just shipping them straight to termination,” Chaney said.
Ariwoola has never been convicted of a crime.
Police arrested him in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
In a similar case in Michigan involving four students from the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, lawyers from the government leaned into this, arguing in court documents filed this week that “terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation” because students can apply to have their status reinstated.
But immigration lawyers have questioned why Homeland Security terminated the records at all if it did not intend to revoke the students’ legal status.

Chaney also said applying for reinstatement involves a new set of arguments and assumes the student’s records were rightfully terminated in the first place.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case,” the ACLU of South Carolina wrote in court documents. “It cannot, however, misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and bully them into self-deporting without any process of law.”
The ACLU also argued in court documents that universities themselves could lose the ability to host any current or future international students if they fail to comply with federal regulations by allowing a student with a revoked status continue to attend.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Nearly every country in the world has a central bank — a public institution that manages a country’s currency and its monetary policy. And these banks have an extraordinary amount of power. By controlling the flow of money and credit in a country, they can affect economic growth, inflation, employment and financial stability.
These are powers that many politicians — including, currently, U.S. President Donald Trump — would seemingly like to control or at least manipulate. That’s because monetary policy can provide governments with economic boosts at key times, such as around elections or during periods of falling popularity.
The problem is that short-lived, politically motivated moves may be detrimental to the long-term economic well-being of a nation. They may, in other words, saddle the economy with problems further down the line.
That is why central banks across the globe tend to receive significant leeway to set interest rates independently and free from the electoral wishes of politicians.
In fact, monetary policymaking that is data-driven and technocratic, rather than politically motivated, has since the early 1990s been seen as the gold standard of governance of national finances. By and large, this arrangement, in which central bankers keep politicians at arm’s length, has achieved its main purpose: Inflation has been relatively low and stable in countries with independent central banks, such as Switzerland or Sweden — certainly until the pandemic and war in Europe began pushing up prices globally.
In comparison, countries such as Lebanon and Egypt, where independence was never extended, or Argentina and Turkey, where it has been curtailed, have experienced more bouts of high inflation.
But despite independence being seen to work, central banks over the past decade have come under increased pressure from politicians. They hope to keep interest rates low and reap voter gratitude for a humming economy and cheap loans.
Trump is one recent example. In his first term as president, he criticized his own choice to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and demanded lower interest rates. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs are “highly likely” to trigger inflation, Trump lashed out on April 17, 2025, in an online post in which he accused Powell of being “TOO LATE AND WRONG” on interest rate cuts, while suggesting that the central banker’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”
As political economists, we are not surprised to see politicians try to exert influence on central banks. Monetary policy, even with independence, has always been political. For one thing, central banks remain part of the government bureaucracy, and independence granted to them can always be reversed — either by changing laws or backtracking on established practices.
Moreover, the reason politicians may want to interfere in monetary policy is that low interest rates remain a potent, quick method to boost an economy. And while politicians know that there are costs to besieging an independent central bank — financial markets may react negatively or inflation may flare up — short-term control of a powerful policy tool can prove irresistible.
 
Legislating independence
If monetary policy is such a coveted policy tool, how have central banks held off politicians and stayed independent? And is this independence being eroded?
Broadly, central banks are protected by laws that offer long tenures to their leadership, allow them to focus policy primarily on inflation, and severely limit lending to the rest of the government.
Of course, such legislation cannot anticipate all future contingencies, which may open the door for political interference or for practices that break the law. And sometimes central bankers are unceremoniously fired.
However, laws do keep politicians in line. For example, even in authoritarian countries, laws protecting central banks from political interference have helped reduce inflation and restricted central bank lending to the government.
In our own research, we have detailed the ways that laws have insulated central banks from the rest of the government, but also the recent trend of eroding this legal independence.
 
Politicizing appointees
Around the world, appointments to central bank leadership are political — elected politicians select candidates based on career credentials, political affiliation and, importantly, their dislike or tolerance of inflation.
But lawmakers in different countries exercise different degrees of political control.
A 2025 study shows that the large majority of central bank leaders — about 70% — are appointed by the head of government alone or with the intervention of other members of the executive branch. This ensures that the preferences of the central bank are closer to the government’s, which can boost the central bank’s legitimacy in democratic countries, but at the risk of permeability to political influence.
Alternatively, appointments can involve the legislative power or even the central bank’s own board. In the U.S., while the president nominates members of the Federal Reserve Board, the Senate can and has rejected unconventional or incompetent candidates.
Moreover, even if appointments are political, many central bankers stay in office long after the people who appointed them have been voted out. By the end of 2023, the most common length of the governors’ appointment is five years, and in 41 countries the legal mandate was six years or longer. Powell is set to stay on as Fed chair until his term expires in 2026. The Fed chair position has traditionally been protected by law, as Powell himself acknowledged in November 2024: “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms. So we’re protected into law. Congress could change that law, but I don’t think there’s any danger of that.” But Trump’s firing of leaders of other independent federal agencies has set up a legal challenge that could affect the Fed, too.
In the 2000s, several countries shortened the tenure of their central banks’ governors to four or five years. Sometimes, this was part of broader restrictions in central bank independence, as was the case in Iceland in 2001, Ghana in 2002 and Romania in 2004.
 
The low inflation objective
As of 2023, all but six central banks globally had low inflation as their main goal. Yet many central banks are required by law to try to achieve additional and sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial stability, full employment or support for the government’s policies.
This is the case for 38 central banks that either have the explicit dual mandate of price stability and employment or more complex goals. In Argentina, for example, the central bank’s mandate is to provide “employment and economic development with social equity.”


Conflicting objectives can open central banks to politicization. In the U.S. the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These goals are often complementary, and economists have argued that low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable high levels of employment.
But in times of overlapping high inflation and high unemployment, such as in the late 1970s or when the COVID-19 crisis was winding down in 2022, the Fed’s dual mandate has become active territory for political wrangling.
Since 2000, at least 23 countries have expanded the focus of their central banks beyond just inflation.
 
Limits on government lending
The first central banks were created to help secure finance for governments fighting wars. But today, limiting lending to governments is at the core of protecting price stability from unsustainable fiscal spending.
History is dotted with the consequences of not doing so. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, central banks in Latin America printed money to support their governments’ spending goals. But it resulted in massive inflation while not securing growth or political stability.
Today, limits on lending are strongly associated with lower inflation in the developing world. And central banks with high levels of independence can reject a government’s financing requests or dictate the terms of loans.
Yet over the past two decades, almost 40 countries have made their central banks less able to limit central government funding. In the more extreme examples — such as in Belarus, Ecuador or even New Zealand — they have turned the central bank into a potential financier for the government.
 
Scapegoating central bankers
In recent years, governments have tried to influence central banks by pushing for lower interest rates, making statements criticizing bank policy or calling for meetings with central bank leadership.
At the same time, politicians have blamed the same central bankers for a number of perceived failings: not anticipating economic shocks such as the 2007-09 financial crisis; exceeding their authority with quantitative easing; or creating massive inequality or instability while trying to save the financial sector.
And since mid-2021, major central banks have struggled to keep inflation low, raising questions from populist and antidemocratic politicians about the merits of an arm’s-length relationship.
But chipping away at central bank independence, as Trump appears to be doing with his open criticism of the Fed chair and implicit threats of dismissal, is a historically sure way to high inflation.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Education argued Friday that the department’s “Dear Colleague” letter criticizing some diversity, equity and inclusion practices was merely a reminder to schools that existing civil rights law protects white children from discrimination just as much as children from a minority group.
But to opponents, the letter represents a significant change in policy, which compels teachers to restrain their speech about diversity for fear that their schools could lose access to critical federal funding.
The arguments were part of wide-ranging hearing in U.S. District Court for Maryland over a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association seeking to block enforcement of the Feb. 14 letter, which says schools that do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The government is saying, with its power of the purse: ‘We don’t like diversity, equity and inclusion,’” said Brooke Menschel, a senior attorney at Democracy Forward, who was representing the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher did not rule Friday on the request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the government from enforcing its “Dear Colleague” letter, but said she plans to issue a written ruling in the days ahead. A similar case is unfolding in New Hampshire, where a federal judge heard arguments Thursday from the government, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association. That judge is also yet to rule.
On Friday, Gallagher peppered each side with questions on a number of grounds. Did teachers have standing to challenge rules directed at school districts and states? What type of action exactly did the letter constitute? And therefore, what procedural rules did the government have to follow in order to issue it?
At one point, Gallagher probed about how the “Dear Colleague” letter may be enforced, asking whether a school could come under investigation simply because one student reported feeling troubled by classroom discussions about the historical actions of a particular racial group.
“Some people are more sensitive to discussions in a classroom setting than others,” Gallagher said. “Where does that line get drawn?”
Brown joins another lawsuit against Trump administration, taking on Education Department

Abhishek Kambli, a Justice Department attorney, said the letter was not meant to police such classroom discussions. It was meant to address situations in which students are classified based on race, he said. He highlighted “privilege walks,” wherein participants are categorized based on advantages and disadvantages they’ve faced because of their backgrounds.
He argued that the Civil Rights Act already disallows such activities because they are discriminatory, even though the discrimination may victimize students who comprise a majority group rather than a minority.
“It’s highly unlikely that they’re going to go after a school because they taught a certain book,” Kambli said. “All this letter does is just clarify what the existing obligations are under Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act].”
“They’re trying to make the letter into something that it’s not,” Kambli said of plaintiffs.
But Menschel said that the department, through the letter, was “putting its thumb on the scale of a particular perspective,” causing reasonable teachers to fear reprisal because of particular classroom lessons, and thereby creating a chilling effect on school speech.
One passage in the letter says that “educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” Menschel also pointed to the department’s creation of an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The name of the portal itself points to exactly their perspective, and they are trying very hard to coerce people into sharing their views — and doing so under threat of withholding funds,” Menschel said.
But Kambli argued the portal’s name was just evidence that the department has a new priority in enforcing existing civil rights law: Rooting out discrimination occurring under the guise of “DEI.”
“It is perfectly allowable for the government to have a portal that’s aimed at that particular enforcement priority,” Kambli said.
A portion of Friday’s hearing focused on whether the teachers’ groups and the American Sociological Association had legal standing to file suit and seek a preliminary injunction.
Kambli argued that the Department of Education does not directly regulate individual teachers or school administrators, but rather school districts. The teachers would have to show that they sustained a direct harm from the Feb. 14 letter in order to have standing in court, he said.
But the department has yet to open an investigation focused on something like classroom speech, Kambli said, so the educators’ fears are only hypothetical in nature.
“If they’re censoring based off of something that the DCL [Dear Colleague letter] does not say is disallowed, then that harm is self-inflicted,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, the department announced that it had opened investigations into dozens of colleges and universities stemming from the Dear Colleague Letter. A department news release said 45 of the schools came under investigation because they were participating in “The Ph.D Project,” which the release called “an organization that purports to provide doctoral students with insights into obtaining a Ph.D. and networking opportunities, but limits eligibility based on the race of participants.”
Six schools came under investigation for “allegedly awarding impermissible race-based scholarships,” and one is being investigated for “allegedly administering a program that segregates students on the basis of race.”
Although none of those investigations focus on classroom speech in particular, Menschel said they provide a “relevant and important backdrop” for assessing teachers’ concerns that their own classroom conversations about diversity could result in their schools being penalized by the department.
To combat claims that the issuance of the Feb. 14 letter may have violated procedural rules, including by not offering an opportunity for public comment before implementation, Kambli argued that the department only issued the letter as a courtesy to schools. The department could have started investigating instances if considered problematic applications of DEI under existing law, he said.
“We didn’t have to provide any of this anyway,” Kambli said. “We did that to put the schools on as much notice as possible.”
But, Menschel asked, if the Dear Colleague letter didn’t represent a change in policy, why did the department pull “hundreds of pages” of prior civil rights guidance documents from its public-facing website?
Kambli argued that new presidential administrations are allowed to rescind Dear Colleague letters from prior administrations, calling it a “common practice.”
Menschel also said the department’s requirement that school systems certify their compliance with the letter indicates that it is a policy change. The plaintiffs asked\ Gallagher to pause enforcement of the letter as well as the certification requirement.
Gallagher said the latter request gave her pause, because the certification process was not mentioned in the plaintiffs’ original complaint, which focused entirely on the letter because the certification process had yet to be issued by the department.
“I’m struggling with the fact that I am being asked to enter a preliminary injunction with something that is not mentioned anywhere in the complaint,” Gallagher said.
But Menschel pushed back, arguing that the certification process is a continuation of the letter itself.
“The department is just recycling the letter, in a way, and taking another step toward implementation,” Menschel said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Luke Pinneo/U.S. Coast Guard)Officials at the state Department of Information Technology pushed back on a new audit that raises questions about how much progress has been made on issues found in earlier reviews.
The new report updates a 2024 review that cited more than a dozen concerns, including some redacted cybersecurity issues, at the department. While some progress had been made on those issues, auditors said the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations” from the earlier report.
But agency officials said they had fully implemented corrective action on four and were working on others. When auditors disagreed, Acting DoIT Secretary Melissa Leaman wrote in a response letter that “there are many factual inaccuracies in the draft report that we hope are addressed prior to OLA finalizing the report.”
It is common for auditors to share a draft copy of a report with department heads so that they can respond before an audit is released to the public.
The audit team said it stands by the accuracy of its report.
“DoIT’s response notes pervasive disagreement with our conclusions and several assertions that our comments were factually inaccurate,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen, wrote in the audit. “We reviewed DoIT’s responses and stand by the facts presented … which were factually accurate based upon documentation DoIT was able to provide during our fieldwork.”
The tug-of-war comes as lawmakers in Annapolis have taken a renewed interest in DoIT, following audits and concerns that the agency is not properly overseeing major and expensive technology projects. One top lawmaker characterized the agency’s efforts as a money pit.
The March 25 review by the Office of Legislative Audits looked at November 2024 to January 2025 and found that the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations in the 10 non-cybersecurity related findings” in a March 2024  report, that “concluded that DoIT’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.”
The latest review showed many the earlier recommendations still unresolved, Tanen wrote in a letter to the legislative Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
DoIT claimed it had corrected concerns with ensuring major projects remained on time and on budget, evaluating outside project managers hired by contractors, and providing support documentation for costs in annual reports sent to the governor and legislature.
Auditors, in the most recent review, disagreed saying the efforts were “in progress.”
In another instance, auditors raised concerns about $25 million in cybersecurity remediation work orders. The auditor said the department had not done enough to ensure that nearly $12 million in work invoiced by the vendor related to those work orders.
The department reported to auditors that the issue had been corrected. Auditors, in their report, said corrective efforts were “in progress.”
The department also did not provide any updates on a nearly $589 million technology project called MDThink. Auditors said the recommendations from an earlier audit were not fully implemented.
The department has become a source of frustration for some lawmakers, including Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore).
Both lawmakers said the agency’s “lack of clarity, authority and management and oversight really has led to poor project management, cost overruns and failures.”
One of those failures, according to Hester, was an 80% cost overrun on the MDThink project proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The senator called the resulting $588 million cost “pretty sad.”
Hester and Hershey sponsored a bill this year imposing more oversight over the agency.
The department also caught the attention of Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard). He called the agency “a mess.” He added money for IT projects has been “going down a hole in many ways and in many projects. And it’s really a shame.”
The chair at the time vowed that the situation “has got to get handled, and it’s going to get handled.”
The General Assembly passed identical bills — House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 — aimed at refocusing the department on major projects and ensuring compliance with recommendations from the auditor. The bill now awaits action by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Hester and Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the House bill, are co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity and Information Technology.
The legislation as passed imposes new oversight and reporting requirements.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects. The bill also prohibits contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan.
The secretary must also meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will also determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1126510-newsletter-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Diana Robinson Photography/Getty Images)Many Nebraskans are feeling pressure right now. Whether you’re a working parent in Scottsbluff, a small business owner in Omaha or one of the many farmers like myself in between, one word sums up the current economic mood: uncertainty.
Everyone’s watching their budgets a little more closely, wondering if they can still afford the same basic things they could a year ago.
That’s why we need our leaders in Washington, D.C., to step up. The people we elected to represent us were supposed to focus on lowering prices and making everyday goods more affordable. Instead, we’re dealing with another round of tariffs.
Just one set of tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump on April 2 — what he called “Liberation Day” — will cost the average American household about $2,100. If all of his proposed tariffs for 2025 go into effect? That number jumps to $3,800.
Pain is real
Nebraskans certainly didn’t vote in 2024 to have nearly four grand pulled out of our pockets.
The concern about costs isn’t a Republican issue or a Democrat issue: It’s an everybody issue.
Poll after poll shows the majority of voters are worried about prices. Even Trump’s own pollster found cost of living is the top concern for his supporters and swing voters. Nebraskans voted for policies that would ease inflation and let us keep more of what we earn. What we’ve gotten instead is the opposite.
The tariff-heavy approach doesn’t reflect the message many sent at the ballot box.
Inflation is already projected to go over 4% this year, and after the April tariff news, the stock market had its worst week since the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer confidence has been dropping every month in 2025. It’s now the lowest it’s been since late 2022.
The hit to Nebraskans’ wallets is only part of the story. New tariffs are also hurting the backbone of Nebraska’s economy: agriculture.
We’re the Cornhusker State for a reason. Our corn production brings in more than $8 billion each year. But now our top export is at risk. In 2024, more than 90% of Nebraska’s corn exports went to Canada, Mexico and China, the countries being hit the hardest by these tariffs.
Agriculture always pays
This isn’t a new kind of pain for Nebraska’s farmers. Back in 2019, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said tariffs cost us $1 billion. That’s a tough pill to swallow, but for many farmers, it’s just more of the same.
Paul Krueger, a corn and soybean farmer from Bladen said it best: “Any time our country gets involved with any sort of tariffs that affect the agriculture industry, every farmer just kind of groans about that. We’re powerless to do anything except take what comes out in the wash.”
He’s right. And it’s not just farmers. It’s business owners across Nebraska who feel forgotten. While tariffs grab the spotlight, other policies that could actually help drive down costs are being pushed aside.
Take the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which would extend tax cuts that spurred the economy during the president’s first term. This key legislation still hasn’t been extended. Policies that would cut red tape to empower small businesses are also on the backburner. Crucial industries like manufacturing, which is huge for our state, seem to be being ignored.
Tariffs can have a purpose. But the way they’re being used right now doesn’t match what voters asked for. Even some of President Trump’s former advisors have said we should’ve gone with tax cuts before tariffs.
It’s not too late
That said, it’s not too late. There’s still time to put working families first, to make the economy more affordable and to follow through on the promises that got officials elected.
Nebraska’s own U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is moving in the right direction. He introduced a bill in Congress to give more say back to Congress on trade policy. He put it simply: “The Constitution is clear … Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes and we gave some of that power to the executive branch. … In hindsight, that was a mistake.”
It’s that kind of thinking we need. It shows he’s looking out for Nebraska families, farmers and workers who just want relief from rising costs.
We don’t need more economic strain. Nebraskans voted for lower prices and a better standard of living.
It’s time for our leaders to deliver.

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune)Is Utah’s “school choice” program unconstitutional? A year after Utah’s largest teacher union sued the state over that question, a 3rd District Court judge ruled that the program known as “Utah Fits All” violates the state constitution.
The Utah Education Association had argued that the Utah Fits All program violated articles III and X of the Utah Constitution because it was a “program within the public education system that is not free and is not ‘open to all the children of Utah,’” and diverts constitutionally appropriated funds from already underfunded public schools. 
The Utah Fits All program was established in 2023, providing up to $8,000 in scholarships per eligible student to cover private schools, or homeschool curriculums. In 2024, the Utah Legislature doubled the initial appropriation of $42.5 million in ongoing income tax revenue by adding an additional $40 million. And this year, that number grew $40 million more.

The money was enough to pay for the vouchers of 10,000 students — about 80% of them are homeschooled. But, with a waitlist of 17,000 and other irregularities in the expenses reported by parents, the Legislature this year approved a series of reforms, reducing scholarship amounts of homeschooled students to $4,000 a year for students ages 5 to 11 and $6,000 for ages 12 to 18. Those attending private schools can still receive $8,000 a year.
Lawmakers also prohibited some expenses like ski passes, furniture and musical instruments, and established a cap of 20% per scholarship for extracurriculars and physical education, an unpopular move among Utah Fits All parents.
In the decision, the court explained why its interpretation of the constitution sided with the UEA, especially highlighting a past Utah Supreme Court ruling that decided that the Legislature’s authority in establishing and maintaining the public education system is limited. “The legislature, for instance, cannot establish schools and programs that are not open to all the children of Utah or free from sectarian control,” the court wrote then.
The UEA celebrated the decision, describing it as a significant victory for public education. 
“This decision protects the integrity of public education, ensuring critical funding remains in schools that serve 90% of Utah’s children and prioritize equitable, inclusive opportunities for every student to succeed,” the union wrote in a statement. “It reinforces the belief that public education is a cornerstone of opportunity for all, regardless of background or circumstance.”

However, Republican leaders in the state lamented the decision and said they intended to continue the legal fight. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called the ruling “a devastating setback for Utah families.” 
“We’re unwavering in our commitment to ensuring that every Utah student, irrespective of zip code or income, has equal access to the educational opportunities they rightfully deserve,” Schultz said in a statement. “We will vigorously pursue every avenue, including the Utah Supreme Court, to overturn this decision and restore hope for Utah’s students and families.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and Gov. Spencer Cox expressed the same disappointment, with Cox adding in a social media post that the state “will be reviewing the ruling with our attorneys and preparing to appeal.”
However, the strongest reaction came from Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, who sponsored the legislation that created Utah Fits All. She called the decision “judicial activism.” 
“It is not the job of judiciary to set policy on the bench and infuse personal opinion and ideology into their decisions. We are not done fighting this fight and will appeal this decision to the Utah Supreme Court,” she wrote in a statement.
Here’s why the court said the school choice program is unconstitutional:
Utah’s Education Article
“Utah’s Education Article does more than simply articulate a policy or aspiration, leaving the legislature with plenary authority to determine how best to accomplish it. It is a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain ‘the state’s education systems,’” Judge Laura Scott wrote in the decision. That includes a public education system open to all children of the state and a higher education system “free from sectarian control.”
The state had rejected that argument stating that the program “is expressly not part of the public education system.” 
However, the court said that the elementary and secondary schools funded through the program are not open to all, since all of them have some sort of application process with assessments, interviews or tests to determine if the student is “fit.” 
While private schools are prohibited from discriminating against students based on their race, color and national origin, “they are not prohibited from discriminating against students based on gender, religion, socio-economic status, disability, sexual orientation or political affiliation.” 
With reduced scholarship for homeschool students, Utah Fits All update poised to become law

Not only can schools deny admission because of these factors, the opinion reads, it also divides children into groups or classes — children attending public schools and children attending private schools — and “provides additional benefits to private or homeschooled children that may not be available to children attending public school, such as funds for computers, test prep courses, private tutoring,” among others.
Amendment G
In 2020 Utahns voted to pass Amendment G, which changed the Utah Constitution to allow intangible property or income tax revenue to support systems of higher education “and to support children and to support individuals with disabilities.”
While Utah GOP leaders said that the amendment allows them to run programs that are designed to support children, the UEA rejected that argument, stating that Amendment G was meant to allow using income tax to fund certain mental health and disability programs, which according to the court, is what the voters who approved the amendment understood with the language. 
That interpretation of Amendment G could also be attributed to the legislative debates on it. 
“No legislator ever mentioned ‘school choice’ or vouchers for children who do not have disabilities. No legislator ever suggested that Amendment G could be used to divert income tax revenue from public schools to private schools,” according to the opinion. The debates, instead, highlighted that the ballot question “would address budgetary constraints by allowing income tax revenue to fund certain social services programs” and “would strengthen public education funding.”

The Department of the Interior said it will soon release a new five-year national plan for offshore oil and gas leasing in federal water, and it will include a new High Arctic planning area. Details will be provided in an upcoming notice in the Federal Register and in information posted on the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s website, the department said in its statement.
“Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement. “Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy development—driving job creation, bolstering economic growth and strengthening American energy independence. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.” 
Further information was not provided by the department.

	Most federal Arctic waters were previously put off-limits to oil leasing by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
President Trump attempted in his first term to open Arctic areas that Obama had withdrawn from the leasing program, but that attempt was struck down by a federal court.
A more recent Trump attempt to open withdrawn waters to oil leasing is now being challenged, as the first attempt was. A coalition of environmental groups sued the Trump administration in February over his efforts to overturn protections in the Northern Bering Sea and areas of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Environmentalists on Friday criticized the newly announced plans for more offshore oil leasing, including in the Arctic.
“Drilling in the Arctic is a disaster waiting to happen. There’s no way to clean up an oil spill there and it will harm polar bears and bowhead whales. Oil companies should think twice about drilling in the Arctic, as it has been plagued with challenges,” Natalie Jones of the Center for Biological Diversity said by email.
The Center for Biological Diversity is one of the environmental groups that sued the Trump administration in February.
Despite some sporadic attempts to explore for oil in federal Arctic waters off Alaska, there has never been any commercial oil production there or in any federal waters off Alaska, except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field, which lies mostly on state territory.

Shell determined later that it could not salvage the Kulluk, and the company scrapped its Beaufort drilling plan that year. In 2015, it abandoned its entire Arctic offshore drilling plan.

	The field that was expected to become the first producing site located entirely in federal waters off Alaska, the Liberty project, has languished for decades without development. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. discovered it in the 1990s and drew up two separate development plans but wound up dropping those. Hilcorp acquired full ownership of Liberty in 2020, but its lack of progress on the project led to expiration of the leases earlier this year.
The last oil exploration attempt in federal Arctic waters was a Royal Dutch Shell campaign abandoned in 2015 after the company spent over $7 billion on it.
That campaign was beset with trouble — most notably, the wreck of a mobile drill rig that escaped its tow and grounded during a storm on Dec. 31, 2012. The rig, the Kulluk, had been used for Shell’s exploration in the Beaufort Sea, the portion of the Arctic Ocean east of Point Barrow. Shell used a separate drill ship in the Chukchi Sea, west of Point Barrow and north of the Bering Strait. That ship, the Noble Discoverer, also had numerous operational and environmental problems.
Shell wound up completing just one well, which was in the Chukchi, and the company concluded that it found too little oil there to justify further development.

Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials today shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
Today’s decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.










It continues to be devastating. Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time. 


– Sarah Bates, commercial fisher based in San Francisco



	Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
Fewer returning salmon
Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
The future of California salmon is murky
Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.

	State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Endowments have been around for a long time. Many universities have had them for decades and are major revenue generators. Have you ever heard a threat to overdraw an endowment fund? Probably not, because they are set up precisely to prevent that from happening. Unfortunately, our current Permanent Fund structure has a gaping hole in it that allows for all sorts of overdraw shenanigans to take place. Many would like to keep this topic as confusing as possible, but really it is quite simple and comes down to this: Would you rather have a portion of our largest savings account continually exposed to ill-advised ideas or would you rather have it all locked up and only allow a known amount to be drawn each year? I realize there are several iterations of how folks want to address this issue but if we are attempting to change the constitution, there is only one responsible way to do it: Move the entire fund under the constitutionally protected corpus.
Let’s start by discussing how the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. views all the unwise ideas the Legislature has proposed to overdraw the fund. The APFC’s only concern is how much cash they need to keep available in case an imprudent idea passes. Legislation that causes uncertainty and thereby impairs the APFC’s ability to invest that cash has a profoundly deleterious impact on overall returns for the fund. 
There are two past examples which expose the need to protect the Permanent Fund from bad ideas. First, a few years ago the House was once again tied up in knots trying to balance their budget. To break the logjam, an amendment was introduced by a member to fund the entire budget, federal funds and all, from the earnings reserve account. I recall this would have amounted to a $12 billion draw. Fortunately, it failed.
Another example occurred when an overdraw of over $5 billion to back-fund PFDs actually passed due to a member being absent. The APFC had to take defensive measures and be prepared to have this additional $5 billion available for distribution.
What the funds were to be used for in either example is not relevant to this discussion even though the PFD continues to be a third-rail item. What is critical to understand is that the APFC had to keep cash available in case either idea passed. This prevents the APFC from keeping that money invested at a much higher rate than holding cash.
Let’s go over the Permanent Fund’s setup once more so we are all clear why the endowment plan is critical to the long term health of the fund. A noble goal espoused by many is to grow the fund to $100 billion, although we seem to have been stuck at about $80 billion for the past few years. We currently have a constitutionally protected portion — known as the corpus — which as of the end of February was about $60 billion of the $80 billion total. This cannot be touched without a constitutional amendment. The other $20 billion, or 25%, is in the earnings reserve account in various forms and is only statutorily protected. As an example, the PFD is also statutorily protected, and we have witnessed how closely that statute is followed. 
These past, real attempts to raid the fund demonstrate the exact reason an endowment is needed to protect the entire fund moving forward, so that future generations can enjoy the same benefits we have all enjoyed for the past four decades. Currently, it is too easy for individual legislators to introduce massive overdraw amendments. All that cash available with a mere majority vote is too tempting. The temptation will only worsen as oil prices drop.
If a constitutionally protected endowment is in place, the APFC would have the comfort and knowledge that a certain percentage of the fund — let’s use the current 5% — and only up to that amount would be required each July 1. Without getting into the more complex draw equation to minimize the annual changes to the draw, the draw of 5% would equate to about $4 billion.
Some might argue that goal is far too aggressive based on historical returns. History demonstrates that mistaken argument is based on the APFC having to sit on far too much cash in case the Legislature or executive branch takes action to overdraw the earnings reserve account. If this option is removed, the APFC would be able to be more aggressive in their investments. Loosening this restraint, even just a bit, could result in a percentage point or two increase in their annualized returns, leading to a real path toward $100 billion and beyond.  
I’ve heard so-called experts over the past few months misleading folks into believing the endowment plan is meant to expose the corpus to spending. Those same folks even suggest the fund will be drained. As a former APFC trustee, I know the endowment concept is to protect the fund for future generations. The concept is simple: Move the statutorily protected — in reality unprotected — earnings reserve account into the constitutionally protected corpus and allow for a known draw for years to come, thereby eliminating the opportunity for decision-makers to even introduce amendments to overdraw the fund. Anything other than moving the entire fund into a constitutionally protected status is not acceptable. The flexibility of always having the earnings reserve account there to overdraw as a “backup plan” has allowed decision-makers to kick the can down the road and not make the tough decisions that will benefit future generations.
The Legislature once again is wrapped around the budgetary axle as they engage in their annual battle on how to fund an ever-expanding government. There are too many variables at their disposal to distract them, such as the earnings reserve account,  oil prices and PFDs. As legislators continue to view the PFD as the main variable, this trainwreck will only get worse. I’m like many others who wish the PFD issue had been addressed when the percentage-based draw took effect several years ago. But it wasn’t, so here we are. Currently the debate is over how much money should be disbured through the PFD and how much new money should be directed to education.  
A constitutionally protected endowment fund producing a fixed, known amount at the beginning of each session coupled with a fairly known, but dwindling, oil revenue projection would take the PFD variable off the table. I’m not proposing anything when it comes to the future of the PFD. This is all about stabilizing the revenue streams we currently enjoy. Introducing income or sales taxes to fund our ever-expanding wish list is for another column.  
We will not be able to have an honest, educated discussion on future revenues and expenditures or the future of this great state until this issue is resolved and the ability to overdraw one of the last few accounts is removed as an option.

State legislators are beginning to recognize this with the introduction of bills like HB 2049, which proposes new revenue streams for education and creates a K-12 Funding Equity Work Group seated at the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  
State leaders are using this moment to ask themselves how education funding should be more fairly and effectively allocated. But this will not be the first time the Legislature has asked that question or even created a work group to explore it. In fact, over the past 16 years, seven legislatively directed reports have explored and provided recommendations on various aspects of our K-12 funding system. (2009, 2009,  2010,  2012, 2012,  2019, and  2022). Unfortunately, these past reports have all fallen short in identifying an approach to resourcing schools that is consistent with the range of supports and services schools currently provide to students.  
Much has changed since our current approach to funding was established in 2010, and especially since the pandemic. There has been a significant shift in the depth and diversity of student needs. Whether it’s supporting mental health, addressing food and housing insecurity, or helping families navigate public systems, schools today are doing far more than delivering instruction. 
Schools have learned that when students’ basic needs are met, they can more effectively engage students in learning, so many districts have responded by working beyond their means to meet a growing diversity of student needs. This evolving role for schools has created a misalignment between what schools need to engage students in learning and how the state provides funding to schools. One of the key reasons this misalignment persists is that previous work groups and funding studies have failed to put the voices of historically marginalized communities at the center of their decision-making, especially students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, and those from families navigating systemic barriers. 
If Washington is serious about creating an education system rooted in equity, that commitment must be reflected not only in our funding formulas but also in how we define the problem and who gets to shape the solutions. Otherwise, we risk continuing the cycle: one where well-intentioned reforms claim equity as a goal but fail to deliver because they were built without the input of those most affected.
The lived experience of students and families is not anecdotal; it is expertise. When we not only invite but center that expertise in the decision-making process, we gain a more honest and accurate picture of what schools need. As we look to improve how we resource public K-12 education, we must use every tool available to design an education system that delivers the learning environments, supports, and opportunities all students deserve. 
If there was ever a moment to assemble a diverse working group focused on reassessing K-12 funding, it is now. We must ask ourselves: how will this be different? How will we ensure that students furthest from educational justice are at the forefront of this process? As funding decisions move forward, these must be the guiding commitments to ensure that real change is achieved.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/school-classrom-k-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 21:01:12.089651

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Hatch United States Courthouse is pictured in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Eight international students in Utah whose permits to study in the country were revoked have sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the “unilateral” and abrupt termination of their legal status in the country, forcing them to lose school time and jobs while subjecting them to detention and deportation. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit in federal court in Utah on behalf of the students on Friday, asking for a temporary restraining order halting the removal of the individuals’ records from Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), a database that tracks their visa compliance and allows them to stay in the country while they complete their studies, or in the case of recent graduates, maintain an early career job.

That, after more than 50 students were reported to be impacted by status revocations in Utah, many without any type of notice. Some of them didn’t have links with protests or a criminal background, generating confusion on campuses. 
According to the suit, the Department of Homeland Security action violated the students’ rights for due process since they didn’t get a chance to contest the decision. It also alleges that erasing the SEVIS records was against federal law and violated the Constitution. 
“(The students) were following all their visa requirements and had committed nothing that should have changed their status,” Aaron Welcher, communication director for the ACLU of Utah, said on Friday.
The ACLU declined to release some details about the students to protect their privacy. However, the organization said they are from China, Nigeria, Mexico and Japan and are attending different universities across the state, including the University of Utah, Brigham Young University and Ensign College. A ninth student from BYU-Idaho was also included in the complaint. 
Cox asks for clarity from Trump administration on revoked student visas

The students have been experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety after learning about their status terminations, and are uncertain about their futures, including fears of being labeled a national security or foreign policy threat, forbidding them from reentering the United States or other countries.
“The abrupt and unexplained termination of these students’ lawful SEVIS registration is profoundly concerning. These students now face deportation or worse, placing their education and futures in jeopardy,” Tom Ford, staff attorney at the ACLU of Utah, said in the release. “Coordinated attacks on due process are paving the way for the kind of tyrannical government our Constitution was meant to prevent — and the ACLU of Utah is taking action to stop that abuse of power and keep rights intact for all of us.”
The termination of SEVIS records effectively ends the students’ permits to be in the country. While the students have the option to apply for reinstatement of status with USCIS, according to the lawsuit, the federal government has informed multiple schools that they will deny all reinstatement applications for students in this specific situation.
The new process of removing SEVIS records was also criticized in the suit.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable for having a revoked visa, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case in court,” the lawsuit reads. “However, it cannot misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and drive them out of the country without process.”

Black maternal health advocates and researchers worry about federal funding cuts. (Courtesy of Birthlooms)Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival. 


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice 


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”
Maternal death reviews get political as state officials intrude

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”
To close racial gap in maternal health, some states take aim at implicit bias

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A stalemate over property tax relief in both Montana Legislative chambers continues with little end in sight as disputes and heated floor sessions continue. 
Montana Senators left a marathon session on the floor without any property tax relief on Thursday after voting down two major pieces of legislation — House Bill 155 and House Bill 231.
In another twist, the House Taxation Committee on Friday morning amended Senate Bill 542, originally a two-year freeze on property taxes, into HB 155 and HB 231. House Bill 155, as amended, would reduce tax rates on residential and agricultural property.
“I think I’m optimistic it’ll be the vehicle,” Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, who sponsored HB 155 said on Friday morning.
The Senate indefinitely postponed HB 231 on Thursday night, but HB 155 in amended form is technically still alive in the chamber. HB 231 was the preferred bill from the governor, and it would have shifted some tax burden onto those with multiple homes.
The 69th Legislative session began with a mandate — both self-imposed by legislators and by the Governor — to develop property tax relief. While movement has been slowly made on the issue, neither chamber has pushed through expansive property tax relief to the executive branch.
The House has had long discussions over the merits of Senate Bill 90, legislation that would take tourism tax dollars and use them for tax relief. That bill has yet to technically see the House floor, but has been discussed for around an hour total during failed blast motions on Wednesday and Thursday.
SB 90 and House Bill 924, legislation that would create a large trust, are also connected.
The discussions on the major bills have been occasionally emotional and often frustrated. It’s also been repeated many times in the hallways, in committee meetings and on the floor that Montanans will hold their elected officials accountable if they don’t pass real tax relief.
In the most recent reappraisal cycle, property taxes increased significantly, even leading to a lawsuit against the state. The worry for many Montanans? Being priced out of their homes with no place to go. Legislators on both sides of the aisle promised property tax help this session.
In the background, deals and arguments over what type of assistance is right for the state reign supreme. But the session is days from concluding and there is no consensus. 
“I think that this is going to be changing every five minutes for the next week,” Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale said on Friday.
 ‘A thoughtfully developed solution’

Even before the session started, Gov. Greg Gianforte formed a task force to help, and from the beginning of the session this year, he looked to push and prod the Legislature to pass property tax reform, specifically in HB 231.
But both political parties are split into their own factions, responding to different political pressures and interests, and a majority has yet to coalesce around HB 231 or any other proposal. 
Some are interested in giving property taxpayers cash in the form of a credit or rebate, some want structural relief, some don’t understand why Montanans can’t have both, and some worry that plans to help residential payers will just hit industry instead.
That impasse has yet to be fully resolved.
There has been some friction between the branches, with legislative Republicans going so far as to issue a press release after the governor made comments about the slow pace of property tax legislation in March.
“The Governor understands the legislative process and should have submitted his proposals earlier if he wanted them enacted more quickly,” the press release stated.
In the meantime, legislators are cobbling together ideas. HB 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, was recently described as a “Frankenstein” bill by Senate Taxation Committee Chairman Sen. Greg Hertz and has faced significant scrutiny.
For Hertz, who represents part of the Flathead, second-homes, including rentals, are common in his district and HB 231 would tax those at a higher rate.
He also said Jones had taken control of the finance and claims process, as well as the budgeting process.
“Now I believe he’s gotten himself into trouble,” Hertz said. “Because now we can only control the budget, but he has no balance over here to allow conservative Republicans to readjust the budget that happens this session.”
During a Thursday press conference, Gianforte reiterated his support for the Homestead exemption in House Bill 231.
“I continue to urge the legislature to keep its focus on Montanans who live in their primary residence, the place that they call home, and not on those who only live here part of the year,” Gianforte said. “Our homestead rate cut was a thoughtfully developed solution and a result of a diverse, bipartisan effort.”
 ‘Why can’t we do both?’

Republican Senate President Matt Regier has pushed Senate Bill 90, a tax rebate proposal.
Hertz has also said he’s in favor of SB 90, as are some House Republicans, including Billings Rep. Katie Zolnikov.
She brought the first motion to bring the tabled bill to the House floor and said the conversation around the legislation has become convoluted, challenging and difficult.
“The most frustrating part of the discussion is that most of the arguments against the bill basically utilize the assumption that this is the only property tax bill that we’re going to pass,” Zolnikov said in an interview. “And so it’s talked about as if it’s this mutually exclusive thing … SB 90 or nothing.”
She also said people then criticize the bill as not being meaningful reform.
“Of course it’s not meaningful reform,” she said. “You’re comparing apples to oranges here. But why can’t we do both?”
Some Democrats have also supported SB 90, including a cohort who has voted in favor of blast motions to move it to the House floor.
That coalition seems to have taken cues from House Minority leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, who has voted in favor of bringing SB 90 to the floor twice.
But her caucus has not completely followed her lead. Sullivan had no comment on SB 90 when reached through staff.
For Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, who has been against SB 90, it’s a general fund issue. He’s concerned the rebate will just eat up more of the fund over time, and that it’s simply not enough relief.
“To me, it’s almost an insult to my constituents,” Karlen said. “If I’m like, ‘Hey, you know, guess what, the rates are still going to be the same, residential property taxpayers keep paying more and more of the total tax share. But don’t worry, we’re gonna give you $250 bucks.’”
When asked if he’d consider rebates as a property tax relief option, Gianforte said, “We’ve been pretty clear we need permanent, meaningful relief.”
 ‘The unique issue of Billings’

Local government policies are playing a role too.
A cohort of representatives from Montana’s largest city have an interest in avoiding the potential legal and constitutional issues related to language in HB 231 and HB 155. 
Under both bills, cities with a charter that has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval could stand to lose millions. This has Billings legislators on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers looking for answers.
“We feel that the unique issue of Billings needs to be taken into consideration when trying to come to a final resolution on property taxes,” Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, said in a Thursday text message. “We are hoping that SB 90 will become part of the solution in conjunction with an overall property tax reform.”
There’s also worry about the constitutionality of legislation surrounding solutions proposed for “the Billings problem,” something Hertz has repeatedly said in committee meetings.
During an impassioned Senate floor discussion on HB 231 on Thursday, Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, pushed back against the idea the potential city charter fixes would be unconstitutional. Fern was carrying the bill in the Senate. Karlen had similar thoughts on Billings Friday morning.
Charters were a problem with HB 155, too, and an amendment was added to that bill to address the issue.
“What I would say to folks in Billings is: You’ll be included in long term property tax relief,” Karlen said in an interview. “It’s just a little bit wonkier in how that happens.”
One of the proposed solutions is reimbursing local governments impacted by the issue with state money, an idea Gianforte indicated he wouldn’t support.
“The other hard line we’ve drawn is that we do not think we should take someone’s income tax dollars and use it to backfill local spending,” Gianforte said. “So that’s something we will not do.”
 ‘Plenty more work to do’

Galt also had a two year-property tax freeze bill he described April 3 on the Senate floor as a “backstop” and “Plan D.” 
It’s now dead, he said on Friday.
Some Republicans had considered the idea as an option — and not just as a last-ditch attempt to show the Legislature did something on property taxes.
“We’re looking at two weeks, if even less, and being out of here,” Regier said on Tuesday. “And so when things come together and come together fast, and that’s obviously one piece that needs to be talked about.”
But all language regarding a tax freeze was cut out, and while Galt’s name is at the top of House Bill 542, it’s a very different piece of legislation. The House Taxation committee approved a large amendment on Friday morning that creates a $400 tax credit for 2024 taxes paid and takes parts from other pieces of tax legislation. 
Residential rates in HB 542 for 2025 mirror language in House Bill 155, starting at 0.76% rate for residential properties. The calculation for 2026 rates are similar to what’s in HB 231. There’s also a fix in HB 542 for Billings and other cities where there has been conflict between bill language and a charter, though its legality is unclear.
House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage said in the House Taxation committee on Friday morning that it was a good amendment and a step toward how the legislature is going to address property taxes.
“This amendment here kind of has a lot of fixes in it for a lot of different concerns that we’ve heard in the last 78 days,” Ler said.
Other supplementary property tax legislation beyond direct relief has passed out of the Legislature.
SB 117, which is on the Governor’s desk, will allow property taxes collected on new development to be used to offset taxes paid by existing homeowners and businesses. Regier has mentioned it several times as part of a fix for property taxes, and sponsor Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he was pleased it passed.
“We’ve got plenty more work to do on property taxes before we wrap up the session, but SB 117 is an important structural reform that will help contain property tax increases heading into the future, and we got it across the finish line,” Sen. Zolnikov said in a press release. “This is a long-term solution to a long-term problem of endless government growth.”
While bits and pieces of property tax legislation have gone through both chambers, no final long-term solution has gathered enough support to get it to the governor’s desk.
“A lot of times you don’t feel like you actually have input,” Rep. Zolnikov said. “Because things have been decided prior. Prior to a committee meeting, prior to a floor vote, prior to the session in general.”
What may have been decided remains to be seen as frustration mounts.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/property-tax-task-force-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 20:07:15.493540

Free bus passes
Sean Tommany, principal of University High School of Science and Engineering in Hartford, remembers how he scolded a student who came into school late. The student insisted that the bus he’d tried to board was packed. “The bus was so full, he couldn’t get on,” Tommany told the Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee on Thursday.
Tommany was speaking in favor of SB 1243, a bill that would set up a state program allowing school districts to apply to the Department of Transportation for bus passes, which the schools could either distribute to students for free or sell to them at a low cost.
Last year, the state of Connecticut granted Hartford Public Schools $175,000 for a pilot program to give students free bus passes. Tommany said that the first month, students rode the bus about 4,500 times.
Oluwaseyi Oluborode, said that her high school has a dual enrollment program with the University of Hartford. Since many of the classes take place after school, students often can’t attend without bus passes. She also recounted her own experience of losing transportation when her parents’ work schedules changed. “I would hesitate to commit to things after school, and I dropped out of volleyball,” she said.
The bill would require the school districts to pick up any additional costs that the reduced or free passes would put on the state. It’s not clear how much the passes would cost each municipality.

PURA ordered to turn over records
A New Britain Superior Court judge this week ordered the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to turn over certain records to Avangrid’s two gas utility companies in their appeal of regulators’ decision to cut gas rates.
In February, those utilities requested discovery of documents relating to their claims that PURA Chair Marissa Gillett bypassed other members of the commission by issuing unilateral decisions during the rate case, and that she secretly helped review an op-ed published in The Connecticut Mirror by two lawmakers critical of the utilities. (Both lawmakers have denied that Gillett helped write the piece).
Attorneys for PURA objected to the motion, arguing that it was premature and part of a larger campaign by the utilities to discredit PURA and Gillett.
In his decision on Wednesday, however, Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik wrote that there was some merit to the utilities’ request and ordered PURA to hand over documents detailing the agency’s decision-making procedures in rate cases, as well as any documents related to the “drafting or authorship” of the op-ed. Those records must be turned over in 15 days, Budzik said.
Bodzik denied a third request for discovery regarding allegations of ex-parte communications between Gillett and a PURA staffer about language that appeared on the agency’s website.
In January, Avangrid and Eversource both sued PURA making similar claims that Gillett was wielding unilateral control over the agency. That case has yet to be decided.Representatives for PURA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

(Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home. 
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture. 
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
 Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe

The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years. 
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino. 
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming. 
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. 
 Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community

The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”  
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options. 
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-04-18 23:03:48+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas abortion clinics saw sizable majority of clients from out of state in 2024,Anna Kaminski,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/briefs/kansas-abortion-clinics-saw-sizable-majority-of-clients-from-out-of-state-in-2024/,A Planned Parenthood clinic that opened in August in Pittsburg marks Kansas' fourth clinic and has increased access to abortions for the region(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector),"TOPEKA — More than 70% of abortions performed in 2024 in Kansas were for out-of-state residents, according to monthly estimates of clinician-provided abortions in states without total bans.
Overall, Kansas was among the top five states in the country with the most substantial increases in abortions performed between 2023 and 2024, with about an 18% increase.
That increase was driven by non-Kansans seeking care, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a health policy research and advocacy organization, that released a report of monthly abortion estimates on April 15.
The report found that clinicians provided more than 1 million abortions in the United States in 2024, an increase of less than 1% from 2023.
Across the country, fewer people generally traveled across state lines seeking abortions in 2024 than in 2023. However, Kansas was an outlier.
Kansas clinicians provided more than 16,000 abortions to out-of state residents in 2024, a 3,300-case increase from 2023. Those abortions accounted for 71% of all abortion performed in the state.
“The latest abortion travel data are a clear reminder that the impact of a state’s abortion policies extends far beyond its borders,” said Kimya Forouzan, the institute’s principal state policy advisor.
The report specifically called out Kansas and Virginia as states with substantial abortion growth driven by out-of-state residents.
“This increase in travel from other states was the main driver of increased abortion counts overall in both states, although other factors like expanded clinic capacity also may have increased access for state residents,” the report said.
Emily Wales, the CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of the Great Plains, said the increase was expected.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics saw people seeking miscarriage management, victims of sexual assault and pregnancies with fetal anomalies. All were in need of care in Kansas because restrictions in their own states were too narrow.
“Too often those patients are being turned away,” Wales said.
Kansas has been a “critical point of access,” she said. Planned Parenthood opened a fourth clinic in August in Pittsburg, creating further regional support. 
People living in states with total bans have few states to choose from, Wales said, so proximity to a major highway or airport and travel affordability become major factors in the decision to seek out-of-state care.
An inflow of more than 5,800 Texans, almost 3,000 Oklahomans, 2,860 Missourians, about 520 Arkansans and 150 Louisianans visited Kansas for an abortion in 2024. States with fewer than 100 people seeking care in Kansas were not identified in the report. Most of those who traveled — more than 14,500 people — received care at a Planned Parenthood clinic, Wales said.
While federal and state restrictions continue to settle, Wales believes people are still frustrated and paying attention to government’s involvement in private health care decisions.
“But also,” Wales said, “I do think people have been somewhat removed from how emotional it can be to get in your car and drive 12 hours to access care.”
The uptick in abortion access comes on the heels of the Kansas Legislature’s 2025 session, during which Republicans made several, mostly unsuccessful, attempts at clamping down on reproductive health care access.
“The data reflects that Kansans were more empathetic and insightful when they voted on this issue than the Legislature seems to be,” Wales said, referring to the 2022 ballot question attempting to limit abortion access, which Kansas voters rejected.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Planned-Parenthood-Pittsbgurg-2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-18 19:07:12.963053

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.

If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

But during busy summer weekends, turning traffic backs up on the Banks Lowman Road, forcing drivers to wait extended periods of time to turn left onto Idaho Highway 55 and return to the Treasure Valley.
Idaho Transportation Department officials said the new, interim traffic signal will provide safer, more predictable turning options for drivers during busy times.
“The new signal will help mobility and safety at this historically busy summer SH-55 river access intersection,” Dan McElhinney, ITD chief deputy and chief operations officer, said in a written statement. “This signal will provide a turning solution for those drivers on Banks Lowman Road, which will help reduce long lines and delays.”
As of Friday, crews were finishing installing the traffic signal poles and making final preparations to activate the traffic signal, ITD officials said. 
Transportation officials said the new traffic signal was based on a study and public feedback. 
In addition to activating the new interim traffic signal, Idaho Transportation Department officials are working on a long-term intersection widening project to meet the growing traffic throughout the region and along the river.
In the past, traffic got so bad at the Bank Lowman Road intersection on summer weekends that the Idaho Transportation Department deployed flaggers to manually direct traffic.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate voted down a resolution Thursday that related to mandated reporting requirements for public officials, a proposal prompted by the sex crime conviction of former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
The North Dakota Young Republicans proposed House Resolution 3037 after reading a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Holmberg, a Grand Forks Republican, pleaded guilty to traveling to Prague with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.
The resolution urged the 2027 Legislature to consider making public officials mandated reporters. North Dakota law requires mandated reporters to report abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable people to local authorities or law enforcement. 
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said the resolution seemed like a “political knee-jerk reaction” that does not accomplish anything of substance, only to ask future lawmakers to think about crafting a new law.
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

“I just want to remind this body today as we consider this resolution that we are working on these things and we’re doing fruitful things on these things,” said Myrdal, who highlighted other legislation that aims to protect children from exploitation. 
Myrdal acknowledged that people were horrified to learn about their legislative colleague’s behavior. But she said many of the positions that require mandated reporting are for positions that work directly with children, which lawmakers do not generally do.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said she is a mandated reporter as a nurse but worries that if the requirement was expanded to include lawmakers she would need to report testimony she receives as chair of the Senate Human Services Committee that may have already been reported.
“Are we going to end up creating a system in which we are bogging down our system and pulling away people who are doing the really, really important work, those child protection workers?” Roers said. She added the Legislature may not want to insert itself into a system that is working well today.
Mandated reporters are required to get updated training, said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
“People need training,” Mathern said. “It’s not that simple to differentiate these cases.”
The Senate killed the resolution on a majority voice vote.
The resolution passed the House unanimously on April 7.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa. 
Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.
The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.” 


The tax credit programs analyzed in the study include: 
Power:

45Y: credits for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions. 
48E: a tech-neutral credit for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions.
45U: credits for nuclear energy facilities with zero emissions.

Industry: 

48C: credits for projects that expand clean energy manufacturing or recycling.
45X: credits for solar and wind energy components.
45V: credits for clean hydrogen production. 
45Q: credit for projects that sequester carbon dioxide by injecting it into underground geological formations. 

Buildings: 

25D: credits for residential clean energy updates like solar panels, wind turbines, etc.
25C: credits for residential energy efficiency updates like new windows, doors or insulation.
179D: credits for energy efficiency updates to commercial buildings.
45L: credits for building or reconstructing energy efficient homes.

Transportation:

45Z: credits for domestically produced fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level.
EV tax credits: credits for individuals who purchase electric plug in or fuel cell vehicles.



According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa. 
Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits. 
Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel. 
“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”
Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines. 
IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”
A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices. 
Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country. 
“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z. 
Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with. 
Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026. 
“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said. 
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.
“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.  
She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.” 
Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs. 
Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said. 
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a Marshall University graduate student whose visa was “unlawfully” revoked as a part of an immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press.  That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. 
The Marshall student, identified in a Friday news release as S.V., was one month away from graduating when his visa was revoked, according to the ACLU-WV. The student received an email stating that his F-1 visa was being revoked and later learned that he was “identified in a criminal records check,” the news release said.
S.V., 28-year-old data science student originally from India, was sentenced to probation in 2020 in Indiana for operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor, according to the release. He left the United States and returned in 2023 to study at Marshall. 
ACLU-WV legal director Aubrey Sparks said that having been identified in a criminal record check is not legal ground for terminating a visa.  
“Our client was not convicted of a crime of violence, nor was he convicted of a crime for which the potential sentence is more than one year, meaning that he categorically is not subject to termination of his F-1 status on those grounds,” Sparks said. 
According to the ACLU, S.V. disclosed the previous charge when re-applying, satisfied all requirements, and was permitted to re-enter the country under the new visa. The student was  in the process of applying for post-graduate work in the United States when he received the  email ending his visa.  
The situation caused chaos for his education and career plans, he said. 
“I desperately want to complete my graduate degree and pursue work in the United States,” he  said in the news release. “It is clear this wasn’t a decision based on my circumstance or experience — this was a predetermined outcome and they just said whatever needed to be said to justify it, even when it  didn’t apply to me.” 
The ACLU-WV filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The complaint names Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
Across the country,  lawsuits have been filed and rallies held in response to the student visas being revoked. 
Government officials have not specified the reasons the administration has canceled visas, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that participating in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza will not be tolerated.
“They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that,” Rubio said. 
In the news release, ACLU-WV executive director Eli Baumwell said international students and scholars are a vital part of the nation’s universities, economy and communities.
“Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that the Trump administration is simply taking the law into its own hands in its crusade against noncitizens,” he said. “Never before has a president taken such sweeping actions to revoke student visas, and that’s why we need the courts to step in and protect their rights to due process under the Constitution.”

Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)WEST YELLOWSTONE, MONTANA — Tchotchke shop owners are busy stocking shelves with Old Faithful shot glasses, stuffed teddy bears and Yellowstone hoodies. Motel managers are hiring their last employees as the summer tourism season begins with the opening of Yellowstone’s West Entrance today.
After park crews plowed a winter’s worth of snow from roads, visitors are now motoring to Old Faithful, Canyon and Norris, marking the unofficial start to the summer. This year, fewer of those tourists, ogling at “red dog” bison calves, delighting in a geyser’s eruption and soaking up spectacular mountain views, will likely be international travelers.
Overseas travel to the U.S. nosedived 11.6% in March, reflecting jitters over Trump administration tariffs, stock market turmoil and foreign bitterness toward the country’s altered relationship with the rest of the world.

Several data points reveal a sluggish start to the summer tourism season.
The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, reported the 11.6% drop in overseas visitation in March. (The figure, compared to the same month last year, does not reflect travelers from Canada and Mexico.)
“U.S. Economy to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away,” Bloomberg headlined an April 14 story.
Mike Gierau, a Wyoming state senator, restaurant owner and co-chairman of JH AIR, a nonprofit business consortium that coordinates service to Jackson Hole, sees the tide. “International travel is dropping like a stone based on all the stuff coming from Washington,” he said.
Moreover, at the South Entrance to the world’s first national park, the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce reports a dip in the 60-day outlook for already booked hotel rooms compared to 2024.
Rick Howe, the chamber’s president, said June and July “are not as strong as we would expect — they’re not picking up as quickly as they [usually] do.”
That 60-day outlook, released March 31, shows about 54% of coming days falling shy of last year’s numbers based on bookings at 16 hotels.
“It’s not going to be a record year,” Howe said.
 Not giving up hope on tourists

In 2024, travel spending in Wyoming amounted to $4.9 billion, according to the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Travel and tourism supported 33,610 jobs, generated $278 million in tax receipts and resulted in 8.8 million overnight visitors, the office said in a review of last year.
Tourism, Gierau said, is the second-largest revenue-generating industry in the Equality State behind energy development. “In tourism, everything you do is taxed,” he said, “everything we buy, everything we sell.”
Despite the data dips, industry officials hope and believe in redemption. If overseas visitors aren’t coming to the U.S., Americans could forego foreign travel as well, spending their time vacationing closer to home instead.
“One door closes, another opens,” Gierau said.
Also, the outlook for visitors to Jackson Hole, while not yet documented by the chamber, is upbeat for August and September, Howe said. Overall, “we’re pretty much on par with last summer — for the moment,” he said.

At Yellowstone’s East Entrance near Cody, lodge owners have seen “a little bit of a drop,” in reservations, said Jennifer Thoma, the executive director of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce. There’s now a glimmer of relief.
“It seems like reservation numbers are back up,” she said.
In addition to tariffs, market turmoil and foreign enmity, DOGE cuts to the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service have rattled travelers. Those indiscriminate firings and resignations have sparked worries that campgrounds won’t open and toilets won’t be cleaned.
Tourism industry leaders seek to assure potential customers that DOGE disorder won’t affect their vacations. Yellowstone National Park Lodges General Manager Mike Keller acknowledged in an email that Park Service “staffing uncertainty” has generated worries.
“We are here to assure you that our operations are unaffected and we are ready to welcome you to a memorable Yellowstone experience this spring and summer,” his email reads. “The park remains open, the views are as breathtaking as ever, the wildlife is flourishing, and the sense of wonder that Yellowstone National Park evokes is unchanging and eternal.”
 COVID redux?

For Howe at the Jackson chamber, the season could mimic the surge in RV campers and regional travel that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. “People are not worried services won’t be available,” he said.
“We are not hearing the concerns that we were two to three weeks ago,” Howe said. “Those calls are not happening anymore.”
He also asked innkeepers a month ago to report whether they’re getting calls from people cancelling reservations because of economic hardships. “The answer is ‘no,’” he said.
Reflecting information from airlines, Gierau predicted “a good summer,” but also one that’s “just different.”
There will be fewer bus tours filled with foreigners and, instead, more people “on the senior circuit,” he said.
The next Jackson chamber 60-day outlook through mid-June, compiled by consultants DestiMetrics, publishes April 20. A crash is “not a major concern at the moment,” Howe said. “It’s kind of a moving target,” Howe said of the summer forecast. “With all the things going on, things changing rapidly, it’s hard to know.”

(Photo courtesy New Mexico Wild)New Mexico Democrats U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez on Friday announced the reintroduction of the M.H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic River Act, which would designate approximately 450 miles of the Gila and San Francisco Rivers and their tributaries “wild and scenic rivers.” That designation would protect the area under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The bill has been introduced three prior times with support from the entire delegation.
“The Gila and San Francisco Rivers are among the last wild, free-flowing rivers in the Southwest— vital to the region’s wildlife, communities, and culture. To truly safeguard the Gila’s wild character, we must also protect its rivers,” Heinrich, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.
Vasquez, who held a news conference with members of the Wild Gila River Coalition in Silver City on Friday, called the Gila River “a symbol of everything we love about New Mexico—wild, beautiful and full of life. This legislation is about protecting that legacy for future generations.”
Reintroduction of the bill came with support from a myriad of sources, including New Mexico Wild Executive Director Mark Allison, who said the bill “honors the original vision of Aldo Leopold and river champions like the late Dutch Salmon, without whose efforts this river we love would have been greatly diminished. The legislation also aims to preserve sites held sacred to communities that have called the Gila region home for centuries. New Mexicans know how irreplaceable our natural and cultural heritage is and overwhelmingly support this effort.”
(For more on Leopold and the Gila, be sure to read his 1921 essay “The Wilderness and Its Place in Forest Recreational Policy.”)
Fort Sill Apache Tribe Chairwoman Jennifer Heminokeky noted in a statement that “much of the Gila and San Francisco rivers are located within the Fort Sill (Chiricahua-Warm Springs ) Apache Tribe’s original 14-million-acre homeland that our ancestors were removed from by force. The Gila River and its tributaries provide a cultural roadmap to our ancestors who thrived in the surrounding lands for centuries. This legislation reflects my belief that it is our responsibility to protect these cultural and natural resources for future generations, just as our ancestors cared for these lands and rivers before us. We will continue to stand with others in this community to protect the Gila and San Francisco rivers.”
Residents and local governments also commended the legislation and remarked on its importance. “Each member of this community has a different story of their experience and connection to the forest and the river, but protection of the Gila is extremely important to all of us,” Silver City Councilor and Mayor Pro Tem Guadalupe Cano said in a statement. “As our community continues to grow and evolve, our love of the Gila is the one thing that stays the same.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gila-River-Middle-Fork-Sara-Bergthold-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Murray State photo)Another international student’s visa has been revoked in Kentucky, this time at Murray State University.
According to local news reports, Murray State shared information about the student’s visa being revoked by the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. A university spokesperson declined to give further information to protect the student’s privacy. 
The news comes amid Trump administration efforts to ramp up deportations. Inside Higher Ed reported that as of Friday, more than 1,550 international students and recent graduates have had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. 
Murray State College Democrats penned an open letter criticizing the university administration for not alerting students sooner to the visa revocation and asking for clearer information about the university’s response. “To be clear, we are not asking that personal information be released, just notification of when law enforcement is present and/or actively targeting students on campuses,” the letter says.
The College Democrats said students and their families choose colleges like Murray because they trust they will be safe there and that Murray “boasts about having international students from over 50 different countries.”
“Every student that seeks to learn at MSU has the right to do so without fear of persecution,” the letter reads. “Actions taken by administration are the only way to prove that the university cares about and will protect those rights.” 
A Murray spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Friday afternoon.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota federal judge ruled this week that a group of Catholic employers do not have to follow new federal regulations meant to protect workers’ access to abortion and fertility treatment, and to shield LGBTQ employees from discrimination.
The order, released Tuesday by Judge Daniel Traynor, relates to two documents issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year. One is a rule implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the other updated non-binding guidance on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws workplace discrimination.
The Diocese of Bismarck and the Catholic Benefits Association took issue with both of the regulations, arguing in an August federal court complaint that they force Catholic employers to go against their religious beliefs.
Bismarck Diocese Bishop David Kagan said in a statement the diocese is thankful for the verdict.
“The Court has upheld our religious freedom rights and that is all we ever wanted,” he said.
Judge sides with North Dakota Catholic diocese, suspends abortion, IVF and LGBTQ protections

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, requires employers to provide workplace accommodations for pregnant and postpartum mothers — like food, water and bathroom breaks, reduced physical labor and medical leave.
The EEOC was tasked with implementing the law through an administrative rule, which was finalized last spring.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act does not specifically say employers must accommodate employees who seek abortions or infertility treatments. The rule does, however — which prompted the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association to sue.
The plaintiffs alleged that in including protections for employees who seek abortions and infertility treatments, the EEOC went against the will of Congress. They also called the rule a violation of their religious freedoms, since the Catholic Church opposes abortion and certain kinds of fertility procedures.
The EEOC’s rule doesn’t include blanket exemptions for religious employers, though the agency has said religious exemption claims will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Laura Bakst, an attorney for the Department of Justice, said at a September federal court hearing that this allows the federal agency to handle cases more fairly.
The plaintiffs argued it’s unfair for employers to only be able to request an exemption when they’re already facing enforcement action.
The lawsuit also took aim at updated workplace harassment guidance published by the EEOC last year. It states that harassment based on reproductive health care decisions — including abortion, fertility treatments and contraception — as well as sexual orientation and gender identity may now be considered sex discrimination under Title VII. 
It lists refusing to use transgender people’s preferred pronouns or not allowing them to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity as examples of possible discrimination, for example.
Plaintiffs claimed this guidance would restrict them from following the Catholic Church’s religious teachings on reproductive and LGBTQ issues.
The guidance “effectively requires Catholic employers to use false pronouns, to avoid speaking the truth regarding human sexuality around certain employees, and to permit opposite-sex employees to intrude into private spaces reserved to those of the other sex,” their complaint states.
Title VII does include an exemption for religious employers, but the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association said the new guidance flouts this exemption.
Employers who don’t comply with the regulations can face enforcement action from the EEOC. They can also be sued by their employees.
At the September hearing, an attorney for the plaintiffs argued his clients will be forced to choose between accommodating practices they consider immoral or being accused of workplace discrimination.
“We’re living in fear that we’ll go through thousands of enforcement actions,” Andrew Nussbaum said during the hearing.
The EEOC has said that it considered public comment, the intent of Congress and guidance from the courts in writing the regulations. It also rejected the notion that either the rule or the guidance would infringe on employers’ ability to practice their faith. 
Traynor last fall temporarily blocked the EEOC from requiring Catholic Benefits Association members to comply with the challenged portions of the regulations. Tuesday’s ruling made those exemptions permanent.
In his September order, Traynor found that the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act rule and the Title VII guidance “place a substantial burden” on the plaintiffs’ ability to practice their religion.
He also wrote that the federal agency did not show it has a compelling interest in leaving the regulations in place, or that the rule and guidance sufficiently minimize the burdens they place on religious organizations.
Traynor was appointed a federal judge in 2020 by former President Donald Trump. He served on the board for the North Dakota Catholic Conference from 1999-2001, according to a questionnaire for judicial nominees.

Spencer Cox says he’s working on issuing an emergency declaration. 
Despite northern Utah seeing average snow this year, counties in the south are exceptionally dry. Cox said he’s currently working with local officials on the declaration, which could extend to a handful of counties in the southwestern corner of Utah that have seen a meager snowpack this winter. 
“We feel really good about where we are,” Cox said about water conditions on Thursday during his monthly PBS Utah news conference, calling it a “pretty normal year for most of the state.” 
“However, I will say it wasn’t a great year for all of the state. And southern Utah, especially southwestern Utah, was well below average and they are seeing some elevated drought conditions there. I would say, yes, there is a very real possibility; in fact, we’re working on it right now, of an emergency declaration,” the governor said. 
Statewide, the snow water equivalent — which is basically the amount of water currently in the snowpack — is at about 78% of normal, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, which tracks the snowpack at sites around the state. Much of northern Utah is between that or higher, with Snowbird’s site at 96%, and a site in Big Cottonwood Canyon at 115%. 
But many NRCS sites in southern Utah are below 50% of the median snow water equivalent, some with just 1%, even 0%. Much of Washington and Iron counties are currently in extreme drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources, while swaths of Beaver, Millard, Juab, Tooele, Uintah, Grand and San Juan counties are in severe drought. 
The rest of the state is either in moderate drought or abnormally dry, except for a sliver of northwestern Box Elder County and the high elevation portions of Salt Lake, Utah, Morgan, Wasatch and Summit counties.

“The Drought Response Committee has been meeting more regularly to address concerns in drought-impacted areas,” said Candice Hasenyager, Utah Division of Water Resources director, in a statement Friday. “Many state agencies are coordinating their response to drought conditions that will likely intensify heading into summer.”
Hasenyager reminded Utahns to hold off on irrigation until “your landscape needs it.” 
“Most of northern Utah can hold off on irrigating until Mother’s Day or until temperatures are in the mid-70s for several days,” she said. 
The state’s reservoirs somewhat mirror the snowpack, with northern Utah looking good and southern Utah falling behind. In the north, the larger lakes and reservoirs — Strawberry, Bear Lake, Jordanelle, Flaming Gorge, Utah Lake, Deer Creek, Starvation and Pineview — are all above 75% capacity, with some hovering just below 100%.
But south of Price, all but five reservoirs — Huntington, Joes Valley, Otter Creek, Quail Creek and Sand Hollow — are above 75%. Some, like Yuba Reservoir or Panguitch Lake, are below 50%. 
The outlook is particularly bad for the country’s second-largest reservoir, Lake Powell, which is federally controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. As of Friday, the reservoir was at about 32% capacity.

According to the Utah Rivers Council, Lake Powell is about 70 feet above the minimum level for the Glen Canyon Dam to generate hydroelectric power. That level will continue to decline into the summer and fall, the council said, pointing to an “increasingly dire runoff future.” 
“The countdown can start on Utah having to cut its portion of Colorado River water,” said Zach Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “Other states in the basin are putting odds on how soon that will happen and it’s definitely coming, alongside the shutdown of Glen Canyon hydropower.”
During the news conference on Thursday, Cox said he is “always worried about Lake Powell,” and has been for years, with the Colorado River plagued by drought and decreased flows.
“The good news is that Lake Powell, that water going into Powell does not come from the southwest side of the state,” said Cox, referring to the source of the Colorado River, which is in alpine areas of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. “The water content in the mountains is a little bit better there.”
The governor can declare a state of emergency in response to natural disasters or public health threats. However, after tension brewed between the Legislature and former Utah Gov. Gary Herbert over his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers passed a law in 2021 limiting emergency declarations to 30 days. 
The Legislature could extend that emergency declaration if lawmakers pass a joint resolution. 
Cox hinted that lawmakers could convene in May for a special session — so if he issues an emergency declaration this month, he’ll have the opportunity to work with legislators to extend the declaration, since it’s likely drought conditions will worsen during the spring and summer months. 
Although he didn’t elaborate on what the order will entail, Cox issued executive orders related to drought in 2021 and 2022. Both orders allowed drought-effected communities and agricultural producers access to state and federal emergency resources.

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal payments to Wisconsin’s Head Start programs in the first three and a half months of 2025 are half what they were a year ago, exacerbating worries about the future of the program that provides child care and early education to low-income families.
The Office of Head Start’s payments to Wisconsin program operators from Jan. 1 through April 15 of this year were down by $35 million from the same period in 2024, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) said this week.
Nationwide, Head Start program operators have received $943 million less during that period this year compared with the period a year ago, according to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), who published a table of calculations comparing disbursements for every state in a press release. The table shows Wisconsin disbursements of $34.5 million as of April 15, compared with $69.5 million in the 2024 period.
Baldwin contrasted the potential impact with the pledge by the White House and the Republican majority in Congress to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term.
“The idea that the president is actively working to give the biggest corporations and wealthiest Wall Street guys a new tax break while taking away preschool and child care from Wisconsinites is beyond the pale,” said Baldwin, vowing to fight actions of President Donald Trump she described as “defunding Head Start.”
The calculations in Murray’s table are based on Head Start disbursement data that Senate Democrats pulled from the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) website at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
While most states in Murray’s table had lower disbursements compared with a year ago, Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia all showed increases.
The calculations put the big-picture numbers on funding disruptions that Head Start providers have been experiencing in the last three months, said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
Those disruptions first surfaced after Trump took office, with delays of up to two weeks in late January and early February for Head Start programs seeking authorized payment for their expenses.
More recently, the disruptions have continued as providers who have submitted the required documents for payment have been confronted with unexpected demands for “more information” Mauer said Friday.
“The [federal] administration is really messing around, pulling out the foundational blocks of grant operation,” Mauer said.
In order to get approved for a grant, recipients must provide a detailed accounting of how it will be spent, she said. To get payment, providers must submit detailed documentation that the expense it covers has already been incurred. 
“This is a highly regulated system,” Mauer said. “There’s a very rigorous initial grant application process, and then on an ongoing basis grantees are demonstrating, ‘We told you what we’re going to spend the money on. Now based on what I told you, I’m asking for that money.’”
The disclosure of the drop in Head Start funding comes a week after a published report raised the possibility that Head Start will be zeroed out of the next federal budget.
It also comes as some providers wait for information about their upcoming grant replenishments, Mauer said.
Head Start grants are provided under multi-year contracts signed with providers. The money itself, however, does not come to providers in large lump sums but in smaller amounts paid upon the submission of documented expenses, Mauer said.
Every six months, an allotment from the provider’s grant is made available, she said. Those funds are not paid directly to the provider, however. The money is set aside for the provider to draw on after submitting expense documents through the federal online payment system.
Providers’ grant cycles start on the first of the month. In Wisconsin, providers whose grant cycle started Nov. 1 have now received confirmation of their next grant allotment for the six months starting May 1, Mauer said Friday.
But with the previous funding access problems and then the sudden closing three weeks ago of half of Head Start’s national offices, including the Chicago Region 5 office that served Wisconsin and five other states, providers were apprehensive.
“The level of uncertainty and chaos is so dramatic,” Mauer said — in contrast not only to the Biden administration, but also the previous Trump administration. Until this year, “these kinds of questions and uncertainties didn’t exist.”
Three providers whose grant cycle started Dec. 1 are waiting to learn whether their next allotment will become available starting June 1 as scheduled.
Mauer said the Senate Democrats’ calculations appear to be “showing the cumulative effect” of the access to HHS funding streams by the team working for DOGE, an agency directed by billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
DOGE is the acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency, although the office is not a cabinet department, and many of its claims of government savings have been questioned.
The hold-up on information is having “a tremendous negative effect on our programs and it’s alarming,” Mauer said. “When we think of what are the impacts of Region 5 closing and that we continue to have very, very minimal and slow communication from the Office of Head Start — they need to start communicating with grantees in a much more substantive way.”
The Wisconsin Examiner contacted the federal Department of Health and Human Services using the HHS website for journalists’ inquiries and has not yet received a response. This report will be updated when a response is received.

As United States immigration officers called out countries, more and more of the crowd gathered in the University of Northern Iowa Mauker Union ballroom stood up. There were 25 countries represented among the almost 70 immigrants attending their naturalization ceremony Friday, having come together to complete their journey to becoming a U.S. citizen.
Family, friends and members of the UNI community cheered as participants received their certificates of naturalization and shook hands with Judge Mark Roberts, who presided over the ceremony. Chance Amani, a 21-year-old from Tanzania celebrating her naturalization, said her little sister was watching in the crowd and she had more family waiting at home in Cedar Rapids to congratulate her.
“I’m so happy,” Amani said, clutching her documents and a small American flag.

During his remarks, Roberts said despite having the honor of presiding over several ceremonies like Friday’s every year, he still gets emotional when he gets to be the first person to tell candidates they are U.S. citizens. Every single person, the youngest being 20 years old and the oldest 74, should be proud of what they accomplished and aware of what it means to be a U.S. citizen, he said.
“We hear a lot these days about what rights we have, but maybe we don’t speak enough about what we owe,” Roberts said. “With the benefit of citizenship comes responsibility of citizenship.”

Those receiving their naturalization certificate Friday were led through the Oath of Allegiance, in which they renounced allegiance and fidelity to any foreign land and pledged to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and law and bear arms, participate in military service and “perform work of national importance under civilian direction” when required.
Other duties U.S. citizens are responsible for include paying taxes, voting for leaders whenever they have an opportunity and following the law, Roberts said.
This was the first in-person naturalization ceremony held at UNI since before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, and university professor and political science department head Scott Peters said it was wonderful to invite people back again to celebrate together.
The ceremony was sponsored by the new UNI Center for Civic Education, Peters said, as it aligns with the center’s goals of enhancing civic education on campus, expanding public outreach and broadening civics education for K-12 students throughout the state.
Seeing all of the people come together for an occasion like this is “an amazing feeling,” Peters said, and it helps remind him not to take what he has for granted.
“I just feel privileged that I even have the opportunity to have a small part in this day that I know is so important for them,” Peters said.
Chelsea Galoni, an immigrant from Canada who earned her citizenship while her wife, daughter, mother and grandmother cheered from the crowd, said she’s been waiting 14 years for this moment. She moved to the U.S. in 2011 to pursue her PhD from Northwestern University and now works as a business professor at the University of Iowa.

During the ceremony, Galoni’s daughter ran about in an empty area between rows of seats, an American flag from her mother waving in her hand. Having her family right there to share in the special moment with was an important aspect of the ceremony that Galoni said she may have missed if it was online.
“There’s an element of humanity that happens when they’re in person that’s nice,” Galoni said.
Ramon Pellizzaro, who moved to the U.S. with his mother and sister from Brazil when he was 11 years old, has Galoni beat for waiting for this day to happen — 22 years. His sister completed her citizenship process during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pellizzaro said, and it felt less formal. Pellizzaro enjoyed having a special event to commemorate this milestone, as it is a big undertaking.
One of the reasons Pellizarro was able to stay in the country for as long as he did before becoming a citizen was his participation in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. He said the program allowed him to “create a life here,” leading to him meeting his wife and working as a data and analytics project manager at John Deere.
“It’s a good country,” Pellizzaro said. “Don’t take it for granted.”

After a number of revisions to the summary language, the board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously to approve the proposal language and the form. 



The final language approved by the board reads:
“Constitutional amendment to: add requirement to verify citizenship by showing a birth certificate, passport and/or other documents for voter registration; eliminate affidavit alternative for those without photo ID when voting; add requirement to provide photo ID or driver’s license or partial social security number to receive our vote in absentee ballot; require Secretary of State to review voter rolls to verify citizens and remove non citizens using documents and government records; prohibit counting ballots from voters without citizenship documents and photo ID unless voters show documents within six days after election; require hardship program for obtaining required documents at state expense.” 



The proposed amendment mirrors an effort introduced by state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) after a Chinese citizen attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor cast a ballot in the previous election.When Posthumus’ proposal was put forth in December, an organization called the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights launched a website proposing a petition drive to get an amendment on the ballot if lawmakers do not take up the proposal.
While Posthumus reintroduced the proposal in January, the effort has yet to come up for a vote on the House floor, with Democrats calling its provisions akin to a “poll tax”. Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights has moved forward with a ballot proposal effort. 
In order to appear on the 2026 ballot, the committee must gather 446,198 signatures within 180 days and file them with the Secretary of State. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the meeting, the board’s Democratic members as well as representatives from several voting rights groups argued the initial summary, as well as edits proposed by the group sponsoring the proposal, failed to capture the full impact of the amendment. 
Alongside concerns that the proposal would disenfranchise married women, low-income individuals, seniors, people living in rural communities and people who are homeless and cannot access the documents needed to prove their identity, board members and opponents raised concerns about how the proposal would impact individuals who have signed up to vote absentee in every election, as well as what documents could be used to prove citizenship. 
Democrat Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the board’s vice chair, specifically raised concerns about birth certificates being listed in the summary, as married women who change their names would be required to submit both a birth certificate and a marriage license to verify their identity, though Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights attorney Charles Spies said this process was not unique to voting alone. 
  Mary Ellen Gurewitz, vice chair of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers during an April 18, 2025 meeting | Screenshot.
Gurewitz further argued that the proposal would strip voters of their rights, pointing to Proposal 18-3 and Proposal 22-2, where Michigan residents voted to expand voting rights to include no-reason absentee voting, nine days of early voting, use of a photo ID or signed affidavit to verify their identity, placement on a permanent absentee voter list and access to ballot drop boxes. 
However, Spies argued the proposal was not removing any right, but rather was protecting the rights of Michiganders to “not have their votes diluted.” 
While noncitizens are not eligible to vote in federal, state or most local elections, some municipalities do allow them to vote in their elections.
Instances of noncitizen voting are exceedingly rare, with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issuing a press release on April 3, noting that the state saw 16 credible cases of noncitizen voting in the November 2024 election out of more than 5.7 million total votes cast, though several members of the public who spoke up at Friday’s meeting argued that any instance of noncitizen voting watered down their right to vote.

Paul Cordes, one of the board’s Republicans members, also argued that any number of voters cast illegally within the state is a problem with the system.
Heather Cummings, the other Democrat on the board, concurred with Gurewitz, arguing that characterizing the proposal as an effort to protect voter rights is misleading. She later questioned how the proposal would impact the ability for Michigan residents to register to vote online. 
Charles Thomas Jr., the founder of the voter rights organization When You Vote – I Win, testified on his own behalf pointing to discrepancies between his and his father’s name on his birth certificate, his name on his driver’s license and his name on his passport. 
“I’m a junior. I love the fact that you know, you all asked me to spell my name. On my birth certificate. I found that my father’s name is spelled C, H, A, R L, E, Y. My name is spelled C, H, A, R, L, I, E. On my license is C H A R L, E, S.  I got a passport, C, H, A, R, L, E, S.  I’m not sure which one would count if I had to produce information to say who I was in order just to be able to obtain the right to vote,” Thomas said. 
Erica Peresman, the Senior Advisor for Promote the Vote, which successfully backed both the 2018 and 2022 voting rights amendments, told the Michigan Advance that these difficult-to-correct discrepancies should not be a barrier to voting. 
While the proposal would have the Legislature craft a program to ensure citizens facing hardship have the documents needed to cast their ballot, the way that program would operate remains up in the air, Peresman said, predicting that state officials would not be the ones helping residents from out of state retrieve their birth certificates from the place where they were born. 

“They’re just going to pay the cost of it, the legwork and dealing with the bureaucracies in these various states, that all has to be done by the individuals.…Our concern is always that people might just give up. They might not have the time, the energy, the resources to be able to run down all of these things, even if the actual cost of the document itself is being covered by the state,” Peresman said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/election-2022-voter-scaled-e1667935206448-1024x7681671667081-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new superintendent at Edmond Public Schools will start his tenure with a higher base salary than the retiring district leader he will replace.
Josh Delich will earn a base salary of $236,903 when he takes office July 1, along with a $20,000 relocation stipend to move to Edmond from Minnesota, where he is an associate superintendent in the state’s largest school district.
Delich will succeed Superintendent Angela Grunewald, who earned a base salary of about $221,000 in 2024 and in 2025 received a total compensation of $248,144 when factoring in the total value of her benefits as well as her base salary, state records show. Grunewald is retiring after four years in charge of Edmond schools.
After hiring Delich on Monday, the district released his contract Friday afternoon to Oklahoma Voice, showing the incoming superintendent’s salary, benefits and additional stipends.
It’s unclear how much Delich’s total benefits will cost on top of his base salary. His contract states the district will cover the full price of premiums for his health, vision and dental insurance, and it will pay both the employer and employee’s portions of his contribution into the state’s Teacher Retirement System. He also will receive $500 per month as an automobile allowance.

In addition to his relocation stipend, the district will pay Delich $3,000 per month for up to six months to maintain his home in Minnesota until it is sold.
Delich will earn $987.10 per day for an expected 23 days for work completed before he takes office as superintendent. A temporary contract lasting until June 30 states he will consult with district officials as he transitions into the administration, including assisting with new employee hires, budget work, facility planning and opening, strategic planning and other tasks deemed necessary. 
Because Delich will be working with Edmond schools during the transition, he will forgo compensation from the Minnesota district, the contract states. His Edmond contract includes a buyout stipend of no more than $18,000. The final amount of the buyout stipend is still to be determined, according to the contract.
Once he takes office, he will be subject to a yearly performance evaluation after which the school board could agree to raise his base salary, which is a common practice for district superintendents. His salary could only decrease through a mutual agreement, according to the contract.
Delich will be near, if not among, the top 20 highest-earning Oklahoma superintendents when he becomes the chief executive in Edmond, the state’s fourth-largest district with 25,700 students.
Norman Public Schools Superintendent Nick Migliorino tops the list with $411,955 in annual salary and benefits, according to compensation data the Oklahoma State Department of Education compiled. 
The state agency’s list, though, doesn’t include Jamie Polk, who leads the state’s second-largest district, Oklahoma City Public Schools. At the time Polk was hired last year, her contract set out a $250,000 base salary, not including benefits and a potential performance bonus.
Like Polk, Delich is a first-time superintendent. He has 21 years of experience in education as a teacher, coach, principal and district administrator. He was an assistant superintendent in St. Paul Public Schools in Minnesota before joining Anoka-Hennepin Schools, Minnesota’s largest district.

While introducing him as the district’s next leader, Edmond school board President Courtney Hobgood praised Delich’s experience, his heart for education and his “passion for continuing the forward progress in Edmond and building on our history of success.”
Delich said Monday he is “blessed and humbled” to become the superintendent of Edmond, which he called a destination district with an “immense amount of excellence.” He and his wife, Desirae, will have their two daughters start school in Edmond in the coming year, according to a letter he penned to district families.
“I want to infuse myself and integrate myself into (the) system to best learn what is going on with Edmond in terms of the excellence that’s happening and also look at the areas that we need to improve and advance while at the same time giving a sense of calm to a district that I know, when you have a new leader, there’s that sense of anxiety,” Delich said while speaking with news media Monday.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington began to offer Medicaid-like health care coverage last year for thousands of low-income immigrants living in the state without legal status.
Now, with talks over the next two-year state budget in their final stages, lawmakers are looking to maintain the expansion. But enrollment in the program remains capped based on available funding and legislators are not on track to change that this year.
Rep. My-Linh Thai, D-Bellevue, introduced a bill early in the session that would have opened the program to all immigrants who meet the income eligibility guidelines and other requirements. 
Her bill, which would have created additional costs for the state at a time when lawmakers are trying to solve a budget shortfall, never got a hearing. Thai also said there was controversy about language referring to noncitizens as “Washingtonians.” 
“We cannot just keep paying for emergency room visits, no coverage,” said Thai. “Charity can only extend for so much, right? I mean, this is responsible governing.” 
Federal law largely prevents noncitizens from accessing benefits through Medicaid, but states can use state dollars to create programs for this population. 
Medicaid, known as Apple Health in Washington, provides health care coverage to people with lower incomes. In Washington, about 1.8 million residents are covered by Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program.
On July 1, 2024, Washington launched a program to offer Apple Health benefits to immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization who meet certain eligibility guidelines. But the program, which is designed to mirror Medicaid, only had enough funding to cover up to 13,000 people. 
Within the first 48 hours, all slots were filled, and an additional 17,000 people signed up to be on the waiting list, according to Sasha Wasserstrom, policy director at the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network. 
Funding for the program is currently around $76.8 million a year. House-approved budget legislation would provide funding in line with that amount. The Senate’s operating budget bill would commit less — $67.5 million and $64.6 million in the next two fiscal years. But the Senate plan banks on changes that would achieve savings in costs for care.
The Apple Health Expansion program, as it’s known, operates only using state funds, as opposed to the traditional Medicaid program, which relies on a combination of federal and state dollars.
Advocates say that since the expansion took place, people have been able to access cancer and dialysis treatments that have extended their lives. 
“It sounds so extreme, but it’s genuine, that people will die as a result of not receiving health care access,” said Kaitie Dong, a policy analyst at the Washington State Budget and Policy Center. 
Republicans argue that the state needs to be careful with its spending during a year with a substantial budget deficit and that the state shouldn’t be giving services to people who are noncitizens while cutting services for others. 
“We should have compassion, but we should also make sure we follow the rule of law,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
In Washington, immigrants without legal authorization to work in the U.S. contributed nearly $1 billion to state and local taxes in 2022, according to estimates from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
“The dominant narrative is that people don’t believe that undocumented immigrants pay taxes, but they’re actually some of our greatest tax contributors and economic drivers,” Dong said. 
Expanding health care coverage to noncitizens can also save the state money by reducing emergency medical care costs, said Wasserstrom. 
“We know that providing preventative medical care is more beneficial to the individual and to the system as a whole, and that causes less strain on the system as a whole,” they added.
Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat people regardless of immigration status. But a lack of health insurance often leads to people waiting until their health concerns worsen to seek care, and they then end up in the emergency room. This can contribute to emergency rooms becoming overwhelmed. 
“It’s hard to actually see emergencies when you’re really stuck seeing people who can’t access primary care because they don’t have insurance or feel safe,” said Dr. Shaquita Bell, a pediatrician and director at Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic in Seattle.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the budget bill Thursday night, but not before slashing millions of dollars in funding through his line-item veto power. The Republican governor’s cuts were wide sweeping across state programs, and services for vulnerable children were among those surprisingly hit.
“When I took office, I inherited a $400 million structural budget gap in the upcoming fiscal year, which would grow to nearly $600 million in the years ahead if it was not immediately addressed,” Morrisey said in a statement released by his office. “The fiscally conservative budget I signed tonight makes progress tackling structural gaps and begins to place us on a pathway toward financial stability in the future.”
The 29 separate line-item vetoes included slashes in funding for roads, school safety and tourism projects. There were also millions of dollars in cuts to programs that serve foster kids, families impacted by substance abuse and sick children. 
Morrisey cut $250,000 in funding for Lily’s Place, a nonprofit organization in Cabell County that provides treatment for newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome and support for families dealing with substance use disorder. West Virginia has the highest rate nationally of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome amid the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis.
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, called it one “the most insulting” of Morrisey’s line-item vetoes. 
“This one should be right at the top — to be able to take newborns that are drug-afflicted and be able to help them,” Criss said. “[It] seems to have a very high success rate of helping newborns getting off the drug situation.” 
Morrisey also decreased funding for the Ronald McDonald House in Morgantown and In-Home Family Education, a parent and child support program in West Virginia.
  W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
“It’s almost like you’re picking on kids who can’t speak up for themselves,” said House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell.
The legislative session adjourned with little action on the state’s abundant foster care issues despite bills introduced to address a myriad of problems, including too many foster children living in hotels. 
Lawmakers wanted to give $1.1 million in state funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system.
Morrisey cut 75% of that funding in his line-item veto. His office did not respond to an email from West Virginia Watch seeking information about the funding decrease. In his veto message, the governor said the program relies on grants and could seek additional grant funding.  
Shanna Gray, executive director of West Virginia CASA, said she was grateful to the Legislature for creating a dedicated line item for the program. 
“We could not be more appreciative of our state lawmakers for prioritizing support for children in foster care,” she said. “Albeit significantly reduced, the governor‘s final allocation of $300,000 establishes a crucial foundation of state support. We remain optimistic about this initial investment and thankful for the state’s recognition of CASA’s essential role in ensuring children’s best interests are represented and heard.”
In total, Morrisey cut $800,000 in foster care funding. 
“The fear is that we’ve got programs out there right now that we do not know if they’ll be able to continue because the federal dollars are going to dry up,” Criss said. “[Morrisey] needs to be able to take a very hard look at all the programs.”
In a news release on Friday, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on the governor to “reconsider these harmful decisions and focus state resources on supporting vulnerable citizens and vital community programs.”

Disagreement among GOP supermajority about budget 
The Republican-led House and Senate passed their $5.3 billion general revenue budget bill last week.
Morrisey’s line-item veto messages used similar language often, saying, “it is imperative that a cautious and prudent approach be taken” while citing concerns about future uncertainties, like the federal stock market fluctuations and federal uncertainty. He also said that there are “ongoing budget challenges.”
The spending vetoes also included $500,000 reduction to Mountwood Park in Wood County for Jeep trails, and a $187,000 reduction to the more than $11 million allocation to the state Veterans Nursing home, and a $250,000 cut for a nursing program at West Virginia State University.
“He decided nursing programs are not where he wants to spend money,” Criss said. 
There was a $25 million reduction to the State Road Fund; Criss said that funding cuts may damage the state Division of Highways’ ability to draw down federal funds for projects. 
Morrisey eliminated $250,000 allocated for the West Virginia University College of Law but did not touch the $1.5 lawmakers gave the university to build a civics learning center overseen by a political appointee. Lawmakers passed a bill mandating the center, but it hasn’t yet been signed by the governor. 
He slashed more than $110 million approved in three surplus funds, which included the funding for Lily’s Place. Morrisey said those funds may be needed for anticipated gaps in Medicaid, Public Employees Insurance Agency and federal changes. 
Morrisey is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump; Hornbuckle said the governor’s decision to slash state spending because concerns about Medicaid and federal changes showed, “Even the governor doesn’t believe his good friend is going to be able to help West Virginians.”  
“We might have to fill back in dollars to Medicaid or PEIA,” Hornbuckle continued. “People need to be really paying attention to what’s going on there, and he doesn’t trust the Trump administration.”
Hornbuckle added that Morrisey’s line-item vetoes showed disagreement among the state’s GOP-supermajority in power. 
Criss continues to refute Morrisey’s projected $400 million structural deficit.
“I am the last finance chairman still in place from the previous administration, I take that a personal cut,” he said. “[Morrisey] doesn’t understand how we have been budgeting and doing the budget process for the last seven years when we’ve tried to keep our ‘operating portion’ of our budget.” The House wanted the state to have surplus money in the back of the budget that could be used for one-time projects.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley, wasn’t available for comment. 
Funds slashed for safe schools, educational programs 
Morrisey’s line-item vetoes included several education-related projects, including funding decreasing to the Mountain State Digital Literacy Program, a math education program and computer science education. In a veto of $200,000 in funding for Safe Schools, Morrisey said it is, “imperative that we limit new spending.” 
West Virginia’s public schools can’t afford to implement millions of dollars in safety upgrades, including secure front entries and weapon detection systems. There are more than $200 million in school safety requests in need of funding.
“How can we in good faith cut money to safe schools and that is something that goes to all of our public education when we are pumping millions of dollars into the Hope voucher program?” Hornbuckle said. 
The budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature opted to put away about $33.6 million from general revenue to the state Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund. That money, Criss said, can be allocated by the Legislature at any time. The fund has more than $500 million in it, drawing frustration from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, during budget debate since other programs had gone unfunded. 
The budget didn’t include $100,000 for clean drinking water in Wyoming County. Funding was cut for the state’s Jobs and Hope Program.
Hornbuckle voted against the budget when it passed the House, citing concerns about a lack of funding for child care. 
“I didn’t think it had a lot of fiscal logic and appropriate the dollars that we do have to public education or child care,” he said. “I’m also confused why we went further down the hole right now in making the current cuts that we did.”
In a statement on Thursday, Morrisey said that “much work remains in the next fiscal year to address budget shortfalls.” 
“ … I applaud the Legislature for sending me a budget that closely resembles my original proposal and begins to address long term issues while funding West Virginia priorities,” he said.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)A bill to create an exemption for cigar rooms from the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act is headed to the House floor — and legislation to strengthen the Act by including e-cigarettes and vape pens in the definition of smoking is headed to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, is an attempt to help the hospitality and tourism industry in the state by allowing places where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Galt said cigar bars are legal in many states, and a supporter representing the hospitality industry said the lack of an exemption here means Montana is at a competitive disadvantage.
In a statement Friday, Galt said he’s pleased with the progress the bill has made.
“Adults over 21 years of age would have the option to enjoy a cigar in a contained location that meets proper ventilation requirements separate from an established bar or restaurant,” Galt said.
Opponents of the bill argue it undercuts an agreement made decades earlier among legislators, some health advocates and the Montana Tavern Association to put the Clean Indoor Air Act in place in 2005 but allow four years for bars to comply.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services describes it as “one of the most important public health policies in state history.”
Montana Tavern Association spokesperson John Iverson could not be reached for comment Friday.
However, at a hearing in March, Iverson told the House Committee on Business and Labor that his board had a robust debate about the bill and didn’t support it because it undercuts the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“It does that by exposing employees to smoke in their workplace,” Iverson said. “For a long time now, our employees have not been exposed to smoke in their workplace.”
But Iverson said the organization would support the bill if it was amended to prohibit employees from entering the room where patrons are smoking and the room had separate ventilation.
This week, the committee voted on an amendment that changed the venue from “cigar bar” to “cigar room” and said employees can’t enter the room while smoking is taking place unless there’s an emergency.
As currently drafted, the bill would allow smoking of premium cigars in “cigar rooms,” separate enclosed spaces on premises that have a license to serve alcohol.
Patrons wouldn’t be able to smoke anything but premium cigars in those rooms, as the bill is written. So no marijuana or cigarettes.
The bill requires a cigar room to be enclosed and have “a solid door” and a ventilation system that doesn’t send exhausted air to nonsmoking areas.
Thursday, the committee approved the bill on a 12-8 party line vote.
In a phone call Friday, CB Pearson, a public health advocate, said the legislation is worse than originally drafted for the health of workers.
“It is the biggest intrusion into the Clean Indoor Air act and the biggest threat that we have faced over the last 20 years,” Pearson said.
Pearson said one reason he believes the current draft is worse is the original bill required a cigar bar to be a separate, standalone structure, and the amended version allows for a separate room in a building.
But he said rooms leak toxic particulates, such as when someone opens a door.
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers’ position is that even when “all practical means of separation and isolation of smoking areas are employed, adverse health effects from exposure in non-smoking spaces in the same building cannot be eliminated.”
It also means an employee who enters the room after hours to clean is exposed to particulates because they fall on the floor and stick to the walls, Pearson said.
“There is no way to have a facility that can protect workers if they have to go in and clean up or attend to a site,” Pearson said.
Before it was amended, Galt told the House committee he had been running a version of the cigar bar bill since he first started in the legislature in the House.
“We have continued working on it, trying to tweak it where we can,” Galt said.
Friday, Galt said the idea the bill is worse for public health than when it started is incorrect because it bans employees from entering those rooms.
“During the legislative process, the bill was amended to be contained to a single room in which employees aren’t permitted to enter,” Galt said. “While this wasn’t my original language, it is the result of the legislative process, and I am glad to see it one step closer to becoming law.”
The bill will head to the House floor as amended.
Another bill that affects the Clean Indoor Air Act is Senate Bill 390, sponsored by Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula. It regulates vapes and e-cigarettes.
It passed out of the Senate on Tuesday on a bipartisan 34-16 vote after being amended in the House.
Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the House, and he said he’s generally a fan of vices.
However, he said he believes there’s a social contract that needs to be honored when it comes to freedom and vices, and the deal includes regulation.
He said Montanans support the Clean Indoor Air Act — a poll said as much as 89% — and Montana has the second highest rate in the nation of vape use, and four times the rate of smoking among adolescents.
“E-cigarettes came into the market just after we passed the Clean Indoor Air Act, so honestly, they probably would have been included had this been on the market at the time,” Nikolakakos said.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question Friday about whether Gov. Greg Gianforte would sign SB 390, which is headed to his desk, or if he would have any concerns about an exemption to the Clean Indoor Air Act in SB 150.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

(Photo via Google Earth)  Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa has dropped its argument in a medical malpractice case that the loss of an unborn child does not equate to the death of a “person” for the purpose of calculating damage awards.
The nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is one of several defendants in a Polk County malpractice case involving the death of an unborn child.
Last month, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center argued an unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages in the case. They also argued that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.”
That position appeared to clash with CHI’s mission statement and ethics guidelines, both of which are based on the concept that human life begins at the moment of conception.
In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.” Initially, CHI and MercyOne argued the cap on damages applied in cases where the “loss” was that of a fetus or an unborn child.
However, during a court hearing on Friday, an attorney for CHI and MercyOne, Christine Conover, informed the court it was withdrawing from the motion to cap damages in the case on that basis.
“We are a Catholic hospital and obviously the Catholic faith believes that life begins at conception,” Conover told Polk County District Judge Scott J. Beattie.
“To be honest, I had wondered about that stance,” Beattie told Conover, referring to the hospital’s previously filed motion seeking to cap damages. “It seemed like kind of an odd stance,” he added, noting that it seemed to contradict the position that CHI had taken in other legal matters.
In a written statement issued Friday, Bob Ritz, president and CEO of MercyOne, stated “we are heartbroken that our belief that human personhood begins at conception would ever be called into question. As a Catholic health system, the sanctity of life is not just a belief we hold; it is the foundation of every action we take.
“While the motion (to limit damages) was accurate from a purely legal standpoint, it has caused confusion and concern. That is why we have asked our counsel to withdraw the motion with respect to MercyOne. No courtroom argument should ever cast doubt on the deeply held Catholic values that guide MercyOne.
“At MercyOne, our Catholic identity is not something we set aside. It is central to who we are. It shapes how we serve and care for people in their most sacred and vulnerable moments. We are more than a health system. We are a health ministry. Our commitment to respect the dignity of every human life, from the very beginning, is unwavering. And it will continue to guide us in everything we do.”
The question of whether the cap on damages would apply in the case is still an issue for other defendants in the case, including Pella Regional Health Center.

Lawsuit stems from 2021 incident
The lawsuit involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — the defendants have argued that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption. As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages.
Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
The case is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
At Friday’s hearing, Beattie indicated he will rule on the question of damages, as well as other unresolved pretrial disputes, as quickly as possible.

Why are both parties split?",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-electric-rates-2025-bill/,"The bill, raised by Sen. John Fonfara, would have CT borrow $2.4B over the next three years to pay off a chunk of residents’ electric bills.","Following months of public angst over Connecticut’s high energy prices, both Republicans and Democrats this week rallied behind what many saw as an audacious proposal: Have the state borrow $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay off a chunk of its residents’ electric bills.
The proposal, Senate Bill 1560, is the work of state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, a veteran lawmaker who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
During a press conference Wednesday, where he was flanked by leaders from both parties, Fonfara said his bill would immediately cut electric costs up to 20% by removing the controversial public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for it through state-issued bonds. The public benefits charge covers the cost of state-mandated energy-efficiency programs, clean energy investments and support for low-income ratepayers.
Additional provisions of the bill would save ratepayers even more in the long run, Fonfara said. Those include revamping the process through which the utilities purchase power for their customers, mandating variable time-of-use electric rates, eliminating certain solar credits and the sales tax on electricity bought by commercial and industrial users, along with other changes. The combined savings could be as much as 40% of customers’ current bills, the senator said.
“There are certain fundamental truths that we must acknowledge and act on if we want to reverse the path we are on,” Fonfara said. “If we choose to do nothing, electricity costs will continue to increase.”
Almost immediately, however, members of both parties began to question Fonfara’s promises of savings and the wisdom of borrowing what would amount to nearly one-third of the state’s annual bond cap — which is currently $2.5 billion — exclusively for this purpose.
Others pointed out that Fonfara is at the center of controversy surrounding a deal with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to place him on a vacant seat at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is in charge of approving electric rates. After that deal was announced last month, press reports revealed that Fonfara owned a company which racked up more than $1 million in fines and late fees from PURA.
In a statement released Tuesday, a spokesman for Lamont said the governor was open to considering some aspects of the bill such as improving the energy procurement process and addressing variable demand for electricity at different times of day.
But the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, made it clear that the governor does not view the creation of a new government entity or more borrowing as viable solutions to the state’s energy affordability issues.
“Rather than putting annual expenses on our ‘credit card’ or crowding out bonding for municipal parks, roads, and school construction with items in the public benefits charge, as proposed, the Governor would prefer we explore ways to reduce [public benefits] charges that may be outdated or unnecessary,” Blanchard said in his statement.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was similarly skeptical of the amount of new debt proposed in the bill and whether it would be paid back with taxpayer funds or revenues drawn from utility bills.
“If there’s state general fund contributions, we can’t afford it,” Ritter said. “If it’s something about the ratepayers paying it back over 30 years as opposed to three, I mean, I’d look at that.” 
Despite those concerns, the bill gained traction this week with the backing of a bipartisan slate of key lawmakers including Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora said that his caucus had been discussing the bill with Fonfara over the last six or eight weeks. In March, Republicans were angered when Democrats on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee opted not to go forward with any of the Republicans’ proposals to reduce residents’ electricity bills.
“This piece of legislation does that, and we look forward to that bipartisan conversation that is so needed to try to address the concerns of our business community and our residents and the impacts that high electric costs have had on the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said.
Fonfara has until April 24 to schedule a vote to advance his bill out of the committee he chairs. 
Utilities weigh in
In his comments to the press Wednesday, Fonfara outlined two key pillars of his legislation that he said would work to reduce electricity costs.
First, it would remove portions of public benefits charge from customers’ bills and shift those costs onto the state through new bonds issued over the next three years. Those bonds would be capped at $800 million a year, for a total of $2.4 billion.
Secondly, the legislation would create a new quasi-public agency known as the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority that would be work with electric utilities, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and local electric cooperatives to create a new method of purchasing electric power supply at lower rates for customers. 
The switch, Fonfara said, would in essence take the utilities’ job of buying power and turn it over to public officials who could work year-round to find the best deals on wholesale electric market, rather than than the competitive auctions the utilities currently participate in twice a year.
“The utilities are being taken out of the procurement business,” Fonfara said. “They’re going to say ‘thank you,’ because it’s a thankless job for them. They make no money on it. They get criticized when rates go up and they don’t get any recognition when rates go down. I’m no apologist for them, but that’s the reality.”

Under Connecticut’s deregulated energy system, customers’ bills are split into four parts: the cost to procure power supply, the transmission and distribution of that power and a public benefits charge.
The utilities must pass on their supply and public benefit program costs to their customers without any markup. The companies earn profits only on the transmission and distribution of the that electricity.
During a public hearing on the bill Wednesday, representatives from United Illuminating and Eversource did, in fact, praise Fonfara’s legislation, which they said offered solutions to reduce customers’ bills while focusing on those areas where they don’t earn a profit. 
“We are hopeful that the concepts in this bill would turn into a reality where we would end up seeing some significant reductions in perhaps the supply charges and other areas that are meant for grid modernization,” said Christie Prescott, the director of wholesale power contracts at United Illuminating. 
Both of the utilities also supported another provision in the bill that would limit the amount of credits that customers with solar panels could earn on their bill by sending excess power back into the grid.
As more customers install solar panels and purchase less electricity from the grid, utility officials said the cost to maintain transmission wires, utility poles and other infrastructure has shifted onto customers without solar panels. The amount of electricity Eversource sold to its customers last year — about 20,000 gigawatt hours — was roughly the same as in 1993, according to data presented to lawmakers from the utility. 
“We have this predicament and it’s not specific to Eversource,” said Doug Horton, the utility’s vice president for distribution rates & regulatory requirements. “The fact of the matter is that we have a declining sales base and a need to continue to invest in the system.”  
That same proposal, however, drew a sharp response from environmental advocates and the solar industry. Both groups said it would dismantle solar incentives while placing further strain onto the grid.
“Energy efficiency and solar have been essential for keeping costs down for customers, because you have to think about the investments in distribution and transmission systems that otherwise would of had to be made over the those 20 years,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, a local environmental group. 
Other critics raised concerns that the cap of $800 million a year on the bonds would not be enough to cover the full cost of public benefit programs — which is currently more than $1 billion a year — leaving the future of those programs in doubt.
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel that advocates on behalf of ratepayers, submitted written testimony to Fonfara’s committee stating that those costs can also shift largely from year to year, making it difficult for officials to know how much money they would have to borrow ahead of time to pay for the programs.  
“Even if it were permissible and the proposed bill was amended to increase the bonding limits to reflect the necessary expenditures, it is not clear that state bond process is best suited to fund the programs indicated in the proposed bill,” Coleman said.
Fonfara said the intent of the bill was to give ratepayers a three-year window of relief. Meanwhile, lawmakers, in conjunction with the new Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, would determine whether the programs under the public benefits charge are necessary and whether the costs to run those programs should be borne by the state or by ratepayers through their electric bills. If they’re determined not to be necessary, he said lawmakers could opt to discontinue them.
“That’s for the legislature to decide,” he said. “But it will be a prudent decision, with a lot more information.”
Party infighting
The top two Democrats in the Senate, Looney and Duff, had previously pledged their support for another bill addressing electric prices — Senate Bill 4 — that is still being drafted by members of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. When asked during Wednesday’s press conference whether the Fonfara legislation had supplanted that effort, Looney said there was no competition between the two bills.
“Eventually, they will all go into the hopper and provide something that I think the people of Connecticut will recognize as a legitimate response to the crisis that we face,” Looney said.
Within a matter of hours, however, tensions between the two committees and their leaders flared into the open.
About midway through Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, the leader of the Energy and Technology Committee, began questioning Horton, the Eversource executive, about a section of the bill dealing with the securitization of storm costs that he said closely resembled a proposal pitched by the utility following Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020. “I just want to be clear where a lot of this comes from,” Needleman asked, when Fonfara interjected.
“Senator, where it comes from is this person right here, it’s my bill,” Fonfara said. 
After more back-and-forth with Horton, Fonfara eventually cut off Needleman’s line of questioning saying that he had surpassed the committee’s five-minute time limit.
“I hope this bill comes to our committee where it belongs and we have a robust conversation about this,” Needleman responded. “This is not the way to solve these problems.”
When asked later about the spat, Looney issued a statement through a spokesman saying that such disagreements are part of the normal legislative process. 
“Forging consensus is a difficult process, but one that is necessary for any bill to become law,” Looney said. “Sometimes we do not know how issues will be framed and resolved until late in the session, whether they are merged into one bill, run separately, or have elements combined into a different vehicle altogether. Unlike the Republicans, we are not free to merely complain and offer unworkable pie-in-the-sky proposals.”
Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, listens to PURA Commissioner Marissa Gillett on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. As part of a deal to clear a path for Gillett’s nomination, Gov. Ned Lamont announced plans on Thursday to appoint Fonfara to a vacant seat on PURA, once it is turned into a quasi-public agency.  Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror
Candelora, the House Republican leader, blamed Needleman’s committee for blocking a number of proposals put forward by Republicans, including a plan that would have made the public benefits charge an annual expense, paid for out of the state’s budget. 
Speaking to a reporter later, Candelora clarified his support of Fonfara’s bill as “a work in progress,” and said he believes some public benefits programs, such as funding for electric vehicle charging stations, are appropriate bonding expenses while others should be budgeted for.
“What has been frustrating about this entire process is that you have a completely dysfunctional energy committee that has made all of these issues highly partisan and highly toxic,” Candelora said.
No Senate Republicans were present at Wednesday’s press conference with Fonfara. The day before, members of that caucus publicly accused Fonfara, their fellow senator, of being complicit in a scheme to provide political support for Lamont’s reappointment of PURA Chair Marissa Gillett in exchange for a job as one of five commissioners at the authority.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, told reporters he believed that deal likely violated the state’s bribery statutes. But in the same press conference, Harding did not discount the idea of working with Fonfara on energy policy.
“We will do anything possible to reduce people’s electric bills in the state of Connecticut,” Harding said. “We don’t care who we have to work with.”
Later in the week, Harding and a top Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said there are “several concerning aspects” of S.B. 1560 and that they would not support the bill in its current form. 
Specifically, Fazio said that Fonfara’s proposed Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority would have overlapping duties with existing state agencies. He also said a proposed fund administered by that authority to adopt smart metering technology and other infrastructure upgrades would result in the creation of what he called a “mini public benefits charge” that would still appear on electric bills.
Still, Harding and Fazio said they welcomed Fonfara’s efforts to address the issue.
Harding said he, too, was concerned with the creation of the new quasi-public authority, which he said he sees as a potential landing ground for Fonfara amid the scrutiny into the senator’s bid to obtain a seat on PURA. “It is quite suspect,” he said.
Tom Swan, the executive director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group, called Fonfara’s promises to save residents money “horribly dishonest,” and he said he thinks the legislation raises several “ethical red flags,” given the senator’s business ventures in the energy industry.
“There is absolutely no trust for Sen. Fonfara to be playing a role in this,” Swan said.
Fonfara told reporters on Wednesday that he has no interest in serving on the new authority. He did not respond to additional requests for comment about the legislation this week. 
A third bill addressing electric prices, drafted by members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee last month, would have prohibited Eversource and United Illuminating from owning both electric and gas utilities, and it imposed new qualification requirements for members of PURA’s board. Ritter, the House speaker, said this week he does not expect that legislation to move forward.
“That was not rightfully raised, and it will crumble,” Ritter said. 
But with respect to the other two bills, Ritter said both have the potential to produce worthwhile ideas. “I think you have two major pieces of energy legislation: S.B. 4 and Sen. Fonfara’s bill,” he said. “My thing would be, let’s put them all together and get a great bill.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4441-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The Utah Lt. Governor’s Office earned the commission’s 2024 Clearinghouse Award for distinguished voter education initiatives and the Salt Lake County Clerk Election Division won for best practices for improving accessibility for voters with disabilities. 
Salt Lake County’s “Try Before You Vote: Accessible Vote Outreach” program earned it a spot on the list. With the initiative, the county’s election division offered live demonstrations of voting equipment and other resources at events for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to test out the tools, ask questions and register to vote.

“This outreach was all about meeting voters where they are,” Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman said in a news release. “We know that confidence and familiarity are key to participation, especially for voters with disabilities. Our team is proud to be recognized for helping make the voting process more accessible, approachable, and inclusive for everyone in our community.”
The election division wrote in its award entry that the program substantially increased confidence and participation in the election process. It also had benefits for election officials by “reducing the need for last-minute accommodations and increasing overall efficiency.”  
The lieutenant governor’s office earned its award for its “12 Days of Election Improvements,” or “Votemas,” a social media campaign nodding to “12 Days of Christmas” traditions, highlighting new voting technologies, procedures and laws in Utah elections. 
“While election-related posts tend to flood social media in the weeks leading up to Election Day, after the dust settles, it’s easy for people to forget that election work continues year-round. Voter records need constant upkeep, and preparation for future elections never stops,” the office wrote in its award entry. “Our goal with Votemas is to remind voters that the work doesn’t end with Election Day — every year is an election year.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Christina Gill says life continues after losing someone to gun violence, but the pain remains and her experience of joy is different.
Gill lost her 39-year-old son Joseph Aieloo on Oct. 4, 2021, after Jay Wagers, 29, shot him in the Santa Fe neighborhood where Aieloo grew up.
Gill, a member of Moms Demand Action, said she still lives in that same neighborhood, because her son was such a dynamic person “there’s no place I can go in Santa Fe that I’m not reminded of his presence.”
Gill spoke on Wednesday morning at an event organized by New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office outside of Robert F. Kennedy Charter School’s middle school campus just outside the Albuquerque city limits, near the South Valley. They were joined by students from the middle school, from the advocacy organization Students Demand Action, and from ACE Leadership High School.
A week earlier, Heinrich re-introduced two pieces of legislation in Congress intended to address gun violence: the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms; and the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“It is not only our right but our duty to advocate for gun safety laws,” Gill said. “I ask you to stand with me today in urging our legislators to pass GOSAFE, to protect our communities and children from the tragedy of gun violence, to protect not just the rights of those who champion the Second Amendment, but to acknowledge their duty as elected officials to pass legislation that protects the equal rights of all of their constituents, especially children, to feel safe in our communities.”
Heinrich said Wednesday that the previous assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited things that were “purely cosmetic,” while the true deadliness of some firearms comes from the mechanisms they use to quickly load a new round after firing the first one.
“It won’t change things overnight but it would move us on a trajectory where there would be far fewer of these weapons of war on the streets over time,” he said.
Gill said Heinrich’s legislation targets particular and especially lethal gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, leaving numerous options for people to buy other kinds of guns to hunt, compete or protect their families
The legislation would require that if a firearm is gas-operated — meaning it uses the gas expended by the first fired round to quickly cycle the firing mechanism and load the next one — it must have a magazine that is not detachable and only holds 10 rounds, Heinrich said.
“We know time and time again that the moment that these mass shootings actually come to an end is when the shooter has to stop, take stock and get reloaded without being able to just slide another high-capacity magazine in,” Heinrich said.
Ken Jones, a hunter and firearm owner, said large magazines are not needed for target practice or self-defense.
“To solve the gun crisis in our country today, in my opinion …we need to have better access to mental health care, we need strong red flag laws and yes, we need to keep the most violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities,” Jones said.
Monicia Henley, senior vice president of corporate affairs with Everytown for Gun Safety, said Heinrich’s bill will prevent more mass shootings, and she called on his colleagues in Congress along with New Mexico state lawmakers to join him.
“This isn’t about taking away our rights, it’s about saving lives,” Henley said. “We need to make a special session happen in Santa Fe, and focus on preventative measures that will save lives.”
Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, said Heinrich’s legislation represents “the first critical steps to remove weapons of war from our civilian population, weapons that never should have been available to any of us in the first place.”

‘My life would be different’
Gill on Wednesday talked about the other people who were hurt in the shooting that killed her son, and the people left to live with his absence.
She said he volunteered for tenant advocacy group Chainbreaker Collective, she said.
“He helped people get off the street,” she said. “He really cared about people who are marginalized. So I am much more empathetic and compassionate as a result of this loss in understanding why he cared so much for people who struggled.”
Gill said Wagers “went on a rampage,” shooting another random victim through the eye who survived with permanent brain damage, injuring another with shattered glass and traumatizing two more people by barely missing them with bullets.
Wagers ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Aieloo’s shooting death, and also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder; two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; and shooting from a vehicle in the same incident. A state district court judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
Gill read from 15-year-old Landon Garcia’s victim impact statement in the case.
“Joey was, and still is, a very important person in my life,” Garcia wrote. “The night I found out he died, I bawled my eyes out. I cried and cried. He was one of my role models and my friend. If this man would not have murdered him, my life would be different.”
Gill told reporters that it’s her duty to do anything that might prevent a similar tragedy from affecting anyone else.
“I stand here for my son, all the Landons and community members, families and friends whose lives would be different if not for the devastation of gun violence,” Gill said. “We’re always going to have conflict, but it doesn’t mean we have to have violence.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250418_141509-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.
Piper Hutchinson: What do you think is coming for higher education this session? 
Rick Gallot: I think certainly starting with a standstill budget is always better than starting with a proposed cut. So, you know, we’re certainly very grateful for that. I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, coming out of Washington and with the constitutional amendments that did not pass, obviously that has created some angst in terms of what do we do now, right? And so I think there is, again, just an overall level of uncertainty that we’ll see it … kind of play out over time. 
I think if you look at the increased revenue from the sales, sales taxes and other things, we’re certainly not in a real bad spot right now as a state in terms of our finances. So I’m still optimistic that we will work through the challenges in the session, and we will come out good on the other side. 
Hutchinson: Looking at the bills that we have so far, what do you think is going to be the most impactful for higher education?
Gallot: It’s hard to say, and when you look at what’s filed versus what ultimately makes it through the process; all bills filed on the front end don’t always make it. Rep. (Emily) Chenevert has come back with another diversity, equity and inclusion bill. We will certainly have to see how that plays out. The bill she had last year started one way and ended up another. … Certainly with all other higher ed leaders, she was very receptive to meeting with us and working through some of those challenges last year. At the end of the day, I think the budget is always going to be the main focus that could impact the trajectory going forward.
Hutchinson: There’s one bill that’s going to have a big impact for your system, talking about transferring UNO back to the LSU System. What should we expect on that front? 
Gallot: For me personally, it’s a full-circle moment. I was in the house when UNO was transferred from LSU to the University of Louisiana System. You know, I just want what’s best for the students, for the campus community at the University of New Orleans. It is a legislative prerogative. They have the authority to transfer universities from one system to the other. So if this legislation is successful, we will certainly do our part to ensure that it is a seamless transition. We will work with LSU, with Board of Regents and with the legislature to ensure that the transition is as smooth as it could possibly be. 
Hutchinson: What’s that like for you [as a former legislator] during the legislative session, being kind of outside the rails?
Gallot: Well, I certainly have a lot of respect for our legislators and the sacrifices they all make in serving. I’m a huge fan of Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits,” and one of those is: “Seek, first to understand then to be understood.” And so I think that’s helpful to understand the pressures that our legislators are under, knowing that there’s a lot that they have to balance. I think it’s helpful, quite frankly. And I don’t think I burned any bridges while here. 
I mean, I did oversee redistricting, so maybe I did [burn] one or two. But for the most part, I still have good relationships with many of my former colleagues … who are still there. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to be a part of the process but from this side. 
Hutchinson: There has been a little bit of controversy in the LSU System lately, that’s reignited these conversations about curbing tenure. What are you hearing on that front, and what would that mean for higher education as a whole if they did take an axe to tenure? 
Gallot: Going back to COVID, and you think about faculty members, who go through the process of, not only a bachelor’s and a master’s and a terminal degree. You know, they get hired, they’re on a tenure track, they’re researching, they’re writing, they’re building their portfolio, and at the appropriate time they apply for tenure. I think we have to respect that process. 
I think it is one that is deeply rooted in higher education, and so I think we certainly have to respect faculty and that they have earned this. 
Now, having said that, it’s always one or two bad apples that will spoil the barrel, as they say. I don’t know that simply doing away with tenure is the answer. 
If the legislature passes something, then we, as a state system, will certainly abide by whatever changes may be made. I think we want accountability at all levels, that we want our students to be in the best position to learn. We want our faculty to be in the best position to teach, and that our students would graduate and go out and make a difference in society. So we’ll certainly be watching it closely, and hopefully we will see thoughtful debate throughout the process. And again, with whatever the ultimate result is, we will work with it.
Hutchinson: I can’t not talk about what’s going on at the federal level. We’re talking about cutting research funding. There are concerns about immigration and graduate students, and certainly tariffs could increase expenses for higher education. How is the UL System adapting to all of this? 
Gallot: Right now there’s so much uncertainty just across the board. Whether it’s the potential loss of research funding and indirect cost, for instance, universities build their budgets based upon what they believe the revenue stream will be from these research grants. I’m hopeful that we will sort of get through this period of uncertainty, and we will see things sort of settle down to be a little more predictable. But you know, at the same time, we will have to adjust if the rules are changed. If the funding formulas are changed, we will just have to adapt. We always have and we always will.

(Courtesy NPS)More than 85,000 out-of-state hunters descend on the Treasure State each year for the chance to take a shot at a Montana elk, antelope, bear or bird.
To pay for that opportunity, they fork over $15 as a base license fee, in addition to buying a tag — ranging from $5.50 for a college student migratory bird license to $1,250 for a moose or bighorn sheep. 
But the Montana Legislature has approved a bill that will increase the base license fee for nonresidents to $100 — a 566% increase. 
The change is expected to bring in an additional $7.2 million in revenue according to the bill’s fiscal note, of which $6.8 million will be allocated to the state’s block management program. 
“The idea of identifying these dollars to go to block management is a concerted effort to try to open up more lands for the public in Montana,” sponsor and Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, told the House Fish Wildlife and Parks Committee earlier this session. 
The state’s block management program was developed 40 years ago as a way to increase access to private land and isolated parcels of public land through voluntary contracts with private landowners. It provides financial incentives for landowners to allow hunters on their property. 
Between 2001 and 2011, land owners enrolled more than 8 million acres in the program, earning up to $12,000 from enrollment fees and compensation based on hunter-day counts. Since 2011, the number of acres enrolled has steadily declined, despite efforts by the state to bolster the program by increasing the compensation cap for landowners to $25,000 in 2021 and $50,000 in 2023. 
In 2024, 1,314 landowners enrolled fewer than 7 million acres costing Montana FWP more than $12 million. 
Boosting payments could be a way for the department to offer more incentives for landowners to participate in the program, according to Quentin Kujala, FWP chief of conservation policy. 
Kujala told lawmakers at a House committee hearing that the staff who work on block management say the biggest reason for loss of access in the program is land sales, and while there are many motivations for selling land, money is certainly a factor. 
Opposition to Parry’s bill came from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, where one lobbyist, Scott Boulanger, said the increase was “drastic.” Representatives of the outfitters association told lawmakers that they would support a more modest increase to $50.
But Frank Szollosi, with the Montana Wildlife Federation, told Senate lawmakers that surrounding states already charge much higher rates for nonresident hunters.
In Idaho, nonresident hunting licenses cost $185; in Utah they cost $144, and in Oregon, $160. 
“We’ve got better hunting than they do,” Szollosi said. 
Wyoming is similar to Montana, charging nonresident hunters a base application fee of $15, and a bill introduced to the legislature earlier this year seeking to increase that to $75 did not advance. 
Parry said that $100 fee is “lint in the pocket” for many out-of-state hunters, who come specifically for the state’s big game and often are hiring outfitters and guides, as well as spending money on their travels to the state to begin with. 
“These folks do come here to hunt in our places. If it’s too much, they can stay in their own states. We need to look out for the people of Montana, and this bill pushes that forward.”
The bill is headed to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51326841831_adf49d4ff0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The news was first reported by The Providence Journal, and confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon by Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Ruggerio.
Paré was unable to confirm what date Ruggerio was readmitted to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, but said it was due to a reaction to a treatment he was undergoing for his cancer diagnosis.
“They’re working to help him regain his health,” Paré said.
Senate President Ruggerio takes more time off to focus on ‘rebuilding his strength’

The news comes five weeks after Ruggerio, 76, was last released from the same hospital’s rehabilitation center after a bout with pneumonia. The North Providence Democrat has been absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25. Ruggerio declined recent interview requests about his health, though Pare said he was doing better, with plans to focus on “rebuilding his strength” ahead of the final stretch of the session.
An email sent from Ruggerio’s Senate email address to lawmakers at 1:39 p.m. Friday, and obtained by Rhode Island Current, stressed the need for the chamber to address the primary care doctor shortage, noting recent actions by insurance companies and Gov. Dan McKee. The email is signed “Donny, Val and David,” referring to Ruggerio, Sen. Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian. 
Less than 90 minutes later, Paré sent another email to senators letting them know Ruggerio was back in the hospital ahead of the news being publicly reported.
Ruggerio originally planned to return to the chamber following its April recess this week. Paré was unsure when asked Friday whether that was still the plan, given his hospitalization. 
Additional information regarding his condition from Fatima hospital was not immediately available.

The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter earlier this month to state agencies across the country requesting that agencies check with local school districts to ensure they don’t have diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
The federal administration is trying to apply the U.S. Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, to K-12 education. The administration said state agencies needed to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court decision. 
Wisconsin is one of several states, mostly led by Democrats, that have pushed back on the request. The Trump administration, which has been targeting diversity efforts in K-12 schools as well as in higher education and other sectors, has threatened that it could pull funding from states that don’t comply with the request.
Wisconsin schools receive $841.9 million from the federal government, making up about 8% of the total funding for schools across the state. Funding from the Department of Education makes up $568.2 million of that, and according to DPI, this is equivalent to 6,106 educator jobs. 
According to the letter, DPI provided the Department of Education with copies of previous certifications of compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The agency said that its repeated requests for additional information about the new certification request went unanswered. In an April 9 letter, DPI asked for clarification on why the federal government was requesting another certification and asked the Department of Education to answer questions including whether the requested certification seeks to enforce any requirement beyond what is required by federal law and regulation and what legal authority the Education Department is using to make the request a condition of federal aid. 
“If the certified assurances are insufficient to meet the conditions of federal funding imposed by USDE, please articulate the basis in law for imposing these conditions, as well as an explanation as to why these assurances do not fulfill those requirements,” DPI General Counsel Benjamin Jones wrote to the Department of Education.
Underly said the new certification is a way for the federal government to “directly control the decisions in our schools by conditioning federal dollars. This is a serious concern – not just for the DPI, but for anyone who believes in lawful, transparent government.”

Goodwine reflected on her life of overcoming obstacles when speaking Friday, and promised to carry “the importance of faith and education and perseverance” with her in the future. 
Trailblazer: A conversation with Kentucky Supreme Court Justice-elect Pamela Goodwine

“I always say I don’t give up on my dreams when life gets hard, I simply work harder to make my dreams come true,” she said. “If there is one philosophy and action I would like to be known for and for you all to recognize and live by as well, that is it. No matter what life brings your way, keep dreaming, keep working for your goals.” 
Goodwine spent time in foster care as an infant and was later adopted by her foster parents, the Lantern previously reported. The Youngstown, Ohio, native and high school valedictorian gave up a college scholarship to support her adoptive father who was dying of lung cancer. About six months after her father was diagnosed, he died. After his death, his brother killed her mother. 
At 24, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an incurable bowel inflammation condition that can be painful and disruptive to life. After that diagnosis, she spent two  months hospitalized and had to re-learn how to eat and walk. 
She began working in the courts  as a legal secretary and court stenographer. She earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kentucky and in 1994 entered private practice with the firm Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs until her appointment to the district court bench in 1999. Goodwine won her circuit judge seat in 2003. She became the first Black woman to serve on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after being elected in 2018.
“I have often been called a trailblazer,” Goodwine said. “More important than achieving any individual accomplishment, I have always believed that it is each of our responsibility to live and serve in ways that make the world a better place for generations that follow us.”

Praise for Goodwine 
During her investiture, Goodwine’s fellow justices praised her for her tenacious character and long career of firsts. They also applauded her for making history yet again in officially donning her Supreme Court robes and inspiring broader trust in the court
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig said race and gender aren’t usually part of the discussions justices have about cases on their docket.

But, she said, “for this court to do that very important work, it is best to have all lived experiences and points of view at the table, because we can all strive to be compassionate and understanding, but we really can’t know what it’s like to be someone else.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear said Goodwine’s win is a “cause for celebration” but “it’s also a reminder of our reality, that nearly 250 years into the history of this great country, we are still recognizing firsts.” 
“Because of Justice Goodwine’s tenacity, pushing through personal tragedy, struggle and, yes, discrimination that still exists in our world, we are closer to the promise of our country that every child no matter their circumstances can dream of being a Kentucky Supreme Court justice,” Beshear said. “I’d like to thank her for making us a little bit better here in the commonwealth today.” 
Chief Justice Debra Lambert called Goodwine’s presence a “gift to our court” and “a reminder that the court should be principled and deliberate and deeply human.” 
While judicial races are nonpartisan, both Goodwine and her opponent received partisan support. Democrat Beshear’s political committees contributed $510,000 to help Goodwine win. Her donors also included former Democratic Govs. Steve Beshear and Paul Patton, as well as some Democrats in the legislature.
Goodwine won her race for the 5th District seat in November, becoming the first woman and fifth person in history to serve at every level of the judiciary. The Kentucky Supreme Court also has a majority of women now, for the first time ever. Goodwine’s investiture was originally scheduled for January but was delayed because of weather.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Jaimie Bartmann planned to quit her job in education.
She loved being a paraprofessional in the Montrose School District in southeastern South Dakota, but after nine years assisting teachers and students, she wanted to make a bigger impact.
“I felt limited,” Bartmann said. “A family trusts you with their child — whether you’re a paraprofessional or a teacher. But as a ‘para,’ you only assist them. I couldn’t make suggestions or make changes I thought would help them.”
A day after she made up her mind, but before she submitted her resignation, her district emailed her with an opportunity: the South Dakota Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway.
The 3-year-old state program allows full-time paraprofessionals to pursue a teaching degree online through Dakota State University in elementary or special education, or through Northern State University in secondary education at a steep discount while retaining their position.
The program’s mission is filling teaching vacancies in school districts across the state, which have worsened in recent years. More than 350 positions were unfilled in July 2024, weeks before the school year started, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota. There were 256 the same time in 2023, 225 in 2022 and 174 in 2021.










The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it.


– South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves


South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves is optimistic that the apprenticeship program will help.
“I’m hoping this year, because we’ve already graduated seven out of the program and believe we might be able to see another 56 to 60 graduate this spring, that would take a large whack out of the shortage,” Graves said.
All seven graduates, including Bartmann, are working in classrooms as teachers or have contracts to begin teaching in a South Dakota school district in the fall.
The program does not contractually require graduates to stay in the teaching profession or in South Dakota. The assumption is that paraprofessionals who’ve worked in the profession for years care about the children in their school, and have built their lives in the community where they work. 
“The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it,” Graves said.

The state Department of Education accepted Bartmann in its first cohort of 90 participants in 2023. Another 70 enrolled in the 2024 cohort. Up to 50 more will enroll in the next cohort this year.
Bartmann moved from the Montrose School District to the nearby Canistota School District in the fall to teach special education for fifth through seventh graders. She taught her students under an advanced teaching certificate before earning her degree in December.
Now she teaches 18 children. She works with two other special education teachers at the elementary and high school levels, and nine paraprofessionals.
Her background is a strength, since “paras are the heart” of special education. She knows the challenges paras face, and listens to them because she understands they see a different side of a student.
“I’m passionate about making sure that I’m fully taking care of a student emotionally and socially, while making sure I see them academically,” Bartmann said.
Graves, with the state Education Department, said the future of the program is uncertain. It was originally intended as a one-time effort, using $815,000 in federal funds and about $446,000 in state funds. 
The program launched its second cohort under the state Department of Labor and Regulation in 2024 due to demand after the Legislature appropriated $800,000 of state funds for the program. The second cohort cost another $410,000 in funding from the department and $9,000 from the federal government.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Regulation said the third cohort will be funded with a combination of federal and state grants, though she said the exact amounts will be determined after the apprentices start their coursework. The federal funding will come from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Apprenticeship Building America grant. School districts pay $1,000 a year per employed apprentice.
If federal funding is cut, Graves said, the program would end or universities might take it over. The department lost $58,178 in funds last month intended for the program, after the federal Department of Education dissolved approved extensions of COVID relief funding. South Dakota lost more than $5 million intended for several education programs.
Graves questions whether the program should continue indefinitely, saying it could be abused to avoid a traditional, more expensive college education.

Students are responsible for up to $1,000 a year in tuition, books and state assessments. Bartmann completed 81 credits of classes within 15 months, costing her a total of $1,500. Sometimes she took more than a full course load in a semester while working full time and raising one of her four children who’s still at home.
“I’d go to school, come home, stay up until 2 a.m. studying and doing homework, sleep until 6 a.m. and then go back to work,” Bartmann said. “Weekends were focused on studying to get done faster.”
Instead of discontinuing the program entirely, she wonders if it could be limited to paraprofessionals who’ve been in the field for a few years. Experienced paras would be less likely to use the pathway as an alternative to the traditional college courses, she said, and the people who would apply would be committed, yet could be financially limited and likely to have obligations — such as children — that might prevent them from pursuing a traditional degree.
Less than four months after earning her degree, Bartmann is already considering earning another degree or certification to improve her teaching. After most workdays, she walks through the school hallways, looking at the colorful student artwork on display and feeling grateful for the new life breathed into her career.
At 46, she has colleagues her age who’ve been teaching for two decades and are planning ahead for retirement.
“I have to pack all those years of experience and impact they made into the years I’ve got left,” Bartmann said. “I want to reach as many students as I can.”
 



 State efforts to address South Dakota’s teacher shortage

Aside from the Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway, the state Department of Education and school districts have made other investments to alleviate the teacher shortage in the state, according to Secretary Joe Graves. 
Paying student teachers and making them the teacher of record
South Dakota lawmakers and the governor approved $500,000 for the creation of a statewide student-teacher stipend program this session. The state Department of Education can use the money to provide grants of up to $5,000 per school district, for payment to one or more student-teachers. The program is intended to keep South Dakota school districts competitive with other states.
“Where you begin your teaching profession is often where you continue it,” Graves said.
School districts can also establish student teachers as the “teacher of record,” meaning the student is the main teacher for a classroom, developing lesson plans and instructing students. If a student teacher becomes the “teacher of record,” a district is required to pay them, Graves said. Student teachers who are paid and regarded as an official teacher of record, he added, are more likely to commit to the district after they graduate, Graves said.
Employing international teachers
School districts across the state are increasingly employing teachers from different countries under working visas. The state Department of Education offers an International Exchange Teacher Permit. About 50 public school districts had international teachers on staff in 2024, according to the department.
Setting a minimum teacher salary and mandating annual increased compensation
The department was a major player in passing legislation in 2024 requiring school districts to meet a minimum teacher salary and increase teacher compensation yearly based on increased funding in state aid.
“We saw immediately that a bunch of school districts moved their minimum teacher salary up, even though the requirement is not going into effect until next year,” Graves said.
Mentoring new teachers
The state department’s mentoring program connects a veteran educator to a new teacher to help guide them through challenges in their first few years of the profession. The first five years is “really the test,” Graves said. When new teachers are mentored, there’s a 15% increased chance they’ll stay within the profession.
Supporting a high school teaching career interest
Educators Rising is a career interest group working to entice high school students to become South Dakota educators. The group holds a “sign up day” similar to athletes for high school members dedicated to earning their teaching degree. The South Dakota Board of Regents approved a program last year to give high school students a jump-start toward their teaching degree by taking career-specific dual credit courses that will count toward a college degree and high school graduation.
Streamlining state reciprocity
Graves said the department has worked to streamline the teacher certification reciprocity process, getting out-of-state teachers employed at local school districts more quickly.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9467-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

(Photo provided by Wells County Emergency Management)The North Dakota Senate this week added funding to a budget bill to help communities that lost federal grants for infrastructure projects.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who introduced an amendment to House Bill 1577 on the Senate floor Thursday, said he’s noticed some “hiccups” involving federal fund distribution.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled about $20 million in grants designated for North Dakota projects. The pulled federal grants announced earlier this month were from FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, designed to help state and local governments with projects that reduce risks to hazards.
Loss of $20 million in FEMA infrastructure grants ‘devastating’ to North Dakota communities

“They had gotten these grants and they were ready to build their projects and the money was pulled out from under them,” Magrum said.
The amended bill authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue up to $9.7 million in loans through the Department of Environmental Quality for wastewater projects affected by the funding cuts. Two wastewater projects that lost funding are a $7.8 million wastewater treatment project in Lincoln and a $1.9 million wastewater lagoon erosion project in Fessenden.
The bill directs the Department of Environmental Quality to seek state funding in 2027 to repay the loans. If federal funds are restored to the projects, the bill requires those funds to be used to pay back the loans.
The bill does not address the other FEMA grants that were cut, which included $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn. Lawmakers plan to add funding for the Washburn project in another bill, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, told lawmakers that backfilling the projects with state-backed loans is a major decision to help those communities. He pointed out that the state Department of Health and Human Services also lost federal funding that has not yet been replaced by the state.
“Get prepared for a special session because there will be a load of these,” Mathern said.
The bill also includes the option for the interim Legislative Management Committee to conduct a study on the potential creation of a wastewater project fund for the state. The study would be presented during the 2027 legislative session and include input from cities, counties, townships and water resource districts. The bill returns to the House.

Tony Evers after signing the 2023-25 budget bill with 51 partial vetoes on July 5, 2023. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A split Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto in the last state budget extending school funding increases for an additional 400 years was within his constitutional powers. 
The executive partial veto powers granted in the Wisconsin State Constitution are uniquely expansive, though they have been limited in the past through Supreme Court decisions and constitutional amendments passed by the Legislature and approved by voters.
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, Evers used his partial veto power striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, saying the action would help provide ongoing financial support to schools. The initial bill had included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years.
Justice Jill Karofsky wrote in a majority opinion that the partial veto was within the power given to Evers in the state constitution, which says “appropriation bills may be approved in whole or in part by the governor.”
“We uphold the 2023 partial vetoes, and in doing so we are acutely aware that a 400-year modification is both significant and attention-grabbing,” Karofsky wrote. “However, our constitution does not limit the governor’s partial veto power based on how much or how little the partial vetoes change policy, even when that change is considerable.”
The case challenging the partial veto was brought by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on behalf of two Wisconsin taxpayers, Jeffery A. LeMieux, a retired professor, and David T. DeValk, a Fox Valley substitute teacher — arguing that the action was unconstitutional and undemocratic. 
WMC Executive Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said they were disappointed by the ruling, and that Evers “exceeded his authority at the expense of taxpayers, and now our great-great-great-great-grandchildren will still be paying the price for his reckless disregard for the law.”
Karofsky laid out several options that lawmakers could take if they want to address the issue further, including by addressing it in a future budget — such as the 2025-27 budget that is being worked on now, by passing a constitutional amendment or by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills to avoid the governor’s partial veto or trying to anticipate how the power might be used. 
Lawmakers have introduced a couple of proposed constitutional amendments. One, which passed last session, would bar the governor from using the veto power to create or increase any tax or fee. Another introduced in January would replace current language that says a partial veto may “not create a new word by rejecting individual letters in the words of the enrolled bill, and may not create a new sentence by combining parts of 2 or more sentences” to say the governor may “only reject one or more entire bill sections.” 
Those proposals have to pass in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature before they could go to voters for ratification. 
Karofsky wrote that the Court “takes no position regarding these measures. We merely outline them to illustrate legislative alternatives to the action before us.”
The three conservative justices on the Court slammed the majority opinion, saying that by upholding the veto the Court has given the executive the power to make law separately from legislators.
“How does a bill become a law?” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote in the dissenting opinion. “According to the majority, one option looks like this: The legislature passes a bill in both houses and sends it to the governor. The governor then takes the collection of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks he receives from the legislature, crosses out whatever he pleases, and — presto! — out comes a new law never considered or passed by the legislature at all. And there you have it — a governor who can propose and enact law all on his own.” 
Hagedorn wrote that the majority’s opinion makes “a mockery of our constitutional order. This is a mess of this court’s making, and it is long past time for us to fix it.” 
In an opinion concurring with the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the precedent set forth in other cases before the court have “emphasized that a partial veto may affirmatively change the policy of the original bill.” Dallet said that she is “open to revisiting” that, but “this case is not a ‘clear opportunity’ to do so.”
“Petitioners do not ask us to overturn any of our prior decisions, let alone reimagine completely our approach,” Dallet wrote. 
Republican leaders and Evers react to decision, upcoming budget
Republican leaders were critical of the decision, saying that the Court had granted the governor unchecked power and that the decision would lead to tax increases for Wisconsinites.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said that the decision was evidence of the Court being partisan and “should worry every Wisconsinite.” 
“Is any Wisconsin citizen surprised that the liberals on the Wisconsin Supreme Court are now a rubber stamp for liberal ally Tony Evers?” Vos asked. “The liberal Justices’ decision itself describes the effects of this decision as ‘significant and attention-grabbing.’ Modest words for a tortured reading of our Constitution that will hurt Wisconsin taxpayers for hundreds of years to come, all in the name of supporting their ally in the Governor’s office.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that the Court “proved again that they will rule based on partisanship and politics rather than the rule of law” and that the veto was “an unprecedented overreach that will impact generations of Wisconsin taxpayers.”
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said that the state cannot afford to provide money for the increases, calling it “wildly unrealistic” and “fiscally unsustainable,” and that increases would be felt by property taxpayers. 
The partial veto applied to increases to schools’ revenue limits, meaning that school districts will have more leeway to bring in funds through property taxes or state funds. The partial veto did not allocate additional state dollars for the increases, though lawmakers could decide to provide state funds for the increases. The partial veto also did not automatically mean school districts would raise taxes, though they would have the option.
Wisconsin has limited school districts’ ability to raise funds through property taxes since 1993. Schools originally received regular adjustments to their limits on an inflationary basis, but that was eliminated in 2009 and since then increases have relied on lawmakers or school districts going to taxpayers for permission to increase taxes.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s via property taxes or income taxes, this money is going to come out of the pockets of Wisconsinites from Tomahawk to Racine,” Felzkowski said. She called on Evers to “come to the table to find a solution to this problem that he created, otherwise average Wisconsinites will be forced to take on the financial burden that he has put on them.” 
Evers said in a statement that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment” and said the decision was great news.  
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation. Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it,” Evers said. “Today’s decision only further underscores the urgent need for Republican lawmakers to approve the K-12 investments I’ve proposed to ensure our kids and our schools have the resources they need now and into the future.”
Evers has called for an additional $3 billion in investments for the state’s K-12 schools, funded with the state’s $4 billion budget surplus. Lawmakers have said the decision would be influential in the shape of education funding in the 2025-27 state budget. 
Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Jill Underly echoed Evers’ sentiment, calling the decision a win.
“The broader need remains: real, usable investments in our schools. That means fair special education reimbursement, meeting the mental health needs of our kids, stronger support for our educators, and access to nutritious school meals at no cost for every child,” Underly said. “These priorities must be reflected in the upcoming state budget. Without meaningful investment and an aid commitment from our Legislature, the burden continues to fall on local property taxpayers.”

(Photo by Carmen Murillo/Getty Images)I am a retired public health nurse with 27 years experience in communicable disease surveillance. I hunted down scary diseases to prevent others from getting sick. I worked with dreaded diseases such as meningitis, tuberculosis, measles, and syphilis. I witnessed the suffering and death of infectious diseases. But good things happened, too. With awe and amazement, I watched vaccination programs eliminate common diseases.
When I became a nurse in 1982, the most common form of infant meningitis was from a bacteria called Haemophilis influenza type b, or HIB. HIB disease causes severe infections, hospitalizations and death. If the baby survived, they were often left with neurological problems. Introduced in 1987, the HIB vaccine virtually eliminated this condition. Medical schools lamented that their interns would complete their entire training without ever having the chance to treat a case of HIB meningitis! 
I worked in the Texas School for the Blind, which cared for children damaged by rubella. Mexico did not have the rubella vaccine until 1985. If contracted in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, rubella causes severe birth defects such as profound intellectual impairment, blindness and deafness. The kids I saw in Texas had microcephaly, or abnormally small heads. It marked me forever to sit in a room full of disabled children knowing it was only lack of political will which sealed their fate.
The public health laws are effective! School vaccination requirements have given us a society where we are not afraid of dying from a plague. Polio has become a distant memory in our grandparents lives. Congenital rubella is very rare. Measles was eradicated from the US in the year 2000.
But this can break down if we are not vigilant. Measles is burning through the country. We have handicapped ourselves by firing the people who respond to public health emergencies. We need epidemiologists and nurses on the ground coordinating efforts.
Success of public health victories means that people have forgotten the horrors of disease. No one has seen the lockjaw of tetanus, or infants choking from pertussis, or malformed skulls of congenital rubella. Our very success has opened the door to complacency. Parents are misled by conspiracy theorists. Pockets of susceptible populations combined with malpractice of cutting our essential public health programs puts our country in a precarious position. It is just a matter of time before measles comes to your day care, your school, your church.
This comes at a time when access to health care is being curtailed. Cuts to Medicaid will leave children and pregnant women uninsured. Rural hospitals will be forced to close. Clinics will be shuttered. Nursing Homes will be emptied. This administration is taking us backwards to an unkind past.
An example of what we should not do is from the state of Idaho. A new law prohibits publicly funded medical services to undocumented persons. The law forbids prenatal care, immunizations, and communicable disease testing to “illegals.” This is in direct contradiction to the guidelines of the CDC. The cruel law makes Idahoans less safe, and thereby, surrounding states such as Utah less safe.
By not immunizing everyone, you create a reservoir of susceptible people where measles can thrive. By prohibiting communicable disease testing, you hamstring public health investigators who seek out deadly diseases like tuberculosis. I was a TB nurse for eight years. We treated people who had been contagious for months before diagnosis. A single case of TB can infect hundreds of others. By refusing prenatal care, women can die from gestational diabetes or eclampsia, a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Idaho will have blood on its hands.
We need a coherent, comprehensive public health policy. The drastic cuts to the CDC, NIH, and the safety net programs will adversely affect us all. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has turned his back on expert advice of the public health pioneers who have wrought health victories that were unimaginable to our grandparents. We must demand that our legislators carry out their responsibility to provide essential services to their constituents.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hands.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

The child’s vaccination status “has not yet been verified,” according to the press release.
The child, who is not a Missouri resident, was visiting Taney County and was diagnosed “soon after arrival,” Lisa Cox, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release. 
Taney County is in southwest Missouri, and its largest city is Branson. 
“Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted,” Cox said, adding that the state is supporting Taney County’s health department to investigate possible exposure. 
The case is “associated with recent international travel,” Cox said.
Measles is a highly-contagious virus the country declared eliminated 25 years ago, but that has resurged with falling vaccination rates. 
“For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,” Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS, said in the press release.
The percent of Missouri kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella has declined over the last several years, from 95% in the 2019-2020 school year to 91% in the 2023-2024 school year, in public schools, per DHHS data. In private schools, the drop has been even larger, from 92% to 85% in the same period.
Nationally, there are at least 800 reported cases of measles across 25 states, according to Center for Disease Control data as of Friday. That doesn’t include Missouri’s case, Cox said, because the state received lab test results Thursday night, after the federal reporting deadline for this week. 
That is the highest number for a single year since 2019 and is still growing.
The majority of measles infections nationally have been reported in a West Texas outbreak. There have been two confirmed deaths, both in Texas. 
Kansas has reported 37 cases, possibly linked to the Texas outbreak.
There are outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, too, and several states have reported isolated cases as the result of international travel.
At the same time, the federal government has cut grant funding set aside for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to encourage vaccinations, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A federal judge brought up the arrest in Leon County of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, during a hearing Friday in which she extended her block of the new Florida immigration law until April 29.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams expressed frustration about the arrests of Lopez-Gomez and others, said an attorney representing the immigrants and groups suing the state.
At issue is Williams’ April 4 order temporarily barring enforcement of a law passed during a special session earlier this year making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday prompted national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reports that he was set to remain in jail because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed a 48-hour hold on him — even after a Leon County judge determined there had been no probable cause for the arrest.
Lopez-Gomez was released from Leon County jail on Thursday evening. The 20-year-old held his mother in a tight embrace and wept when they reunited.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”
Community Justice Project, the ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Florida Legal Services attorneys are representing the plaintiffs: the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status.
David Matthew Costello, lead attorney representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office did not respond to the Phoenix’s questions. The other defendants are the statewide prosecutor and state attorneys.
Binding?
During the hearing at the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida in Miami, attorneys representing the state argued that law enforcement is not bound by Williams’ order, Fahsi Haskell said. Another hearing is set for April 29.
“The Court enters a [temporary restraining order] prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with them from enforcing SB 4-C,” Williams’ order states.
Two other men were with Lopez-Gomez when the trooper stopped the car because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. The driver, Estiven Sales-Perez, and another passenger, Ismael Sales-Luis, were also charged with illegal entry as “unauthorized aliens.” The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
ICE has taken custody of Sales-Perez and is holding him in a Tallahassee field office, according to the online detainee locator system.
“Florida Highway Patrol will continue to work willingly with our federal partners to engage in interior enforcement of immigration law,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement to the Phoenix.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called the arrest a kidnapping.
“Where does the lawlessness of this administration stop? If this can happen to an American-born citizen, it can happen to any of us,” she said in a statement.

The Nebraska Department of Labor on Friday announced March’s 2.9% preliminary, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, noting that it tied Nebraska for the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the country. The state’s unemployment rate, however, is up from the 2.6% reported a year ago for March 2024. 
Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber, in a news release, said the state’s overall labor force reached a record high of over 1,080,000 in March.
“The number of employed workers in the labor force also reached a new high statewide, driven by record highs in the Omaha and Lincoln metro areas,” she said.

The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses.
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
Labor data released Friday showed that Nebraska private industries with the most growth over last year were public education and health services and construction and mining.
Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March inched up to 4.2%, compared to the February rate of 4.1% and 3.9% the year before in March 2024.
Nevada, with 5.7%, reported the highest unemployment rate, followed by the District of Columbia, Michigan and California.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”
Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
 
The legal landscape
 


Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.
This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.
“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.
Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.
 
‘Winners and losers’
 


Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”
GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Opposing attorneys laid out starkly different portrayals Friday of campaign mailers sent during the 2020 election that a Nebraska legislative candidate alleged were defamatory and damaged her business, marriage and reputation.
The attorney for the candidate, Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City, told jurors during closing arguments that the Nebraska Republican Party showed a reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the fliers, which he said falsely stated that she had broken the law and lost her license to practice real estate.
The attorney, David Domina, asked jurors to award Palmtag $4.25 million for the loss of real estate listings and damage to her standing in her community and damage to her relationship with her family.

“Other than to call her names, there’s really no defense here,” Domina said.
The attorney for the Nebraska GOP portrayed the mailers as largely true and said the content had been checked against available public records. It was only later, lawyer Kamron Hasan said, that the party learned the back story about the disciplinary steps taken against Palmtag’s real estate firm by the Iowa Real Estate Commission.
He termed it “an honest mistake.”
“The First Amendment and free speech protects honest mistakes … it protects Democrats, it protects Republicans, it protects other political affiliations,” Hasan said.
The closing arguments came at the end of a weeklong trial in Lancaster County District Court over the defamation lawsuit filed by Palmtag against the Nebraska GOP.
A jury of seven men and four women (One juror didn’t return after being picked to serve.) must decide, by clear and convincing evidence, if the statements made in the campaign mailers were false, that the GOP knew they were false and published them with a reckless disregard for the truth.
Verdict as early as Friday
If the jury cannot reach a verdict by 4:30 p.m. Friday, deliberations will continue Monday, according to the trial judge, Lancaster County District Judge Andrew Jacobsen.
The case raises issues of how far political speech can go during a heated campaign and hinges on whether the political party issued the mailers recklessly or with malice, a legal term that essentially means intentionally.
Palmtag lost the 2020 race for the Nebraska Legislature in southeast Nebraska against the then-incumbent, State Sen. Julie Slama.
The race pitted two Republicans against each other, with Slama being backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, who appointed Slama to her post, and the state party. Palmtag, a longtime state GOP volunteer, was supported by former Gov. Dave Heineman, then-U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, among others.
Palmtag filed her lawsuit three months after the election.
Testimony at trial indicated that Palmtag had called the then-executive director of the state GOP after the initial mailer was sent out on Oct. 8, 2020. The mailer stated that Palmtag had “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license, which Palmtag said was a lie and needed to be corrected.

Instead, the GOP executive, Ryan Hamilton, refused and instead sent a second mailer to 3,200 households stating that Palmtag was “too irresponsible” to serve as a legislator. That piece cited a 2017 civil fine levied by the Iowa Real Estate Commission paid after one of Palmtag’s agents had failed to obtain all the required signatures for a transfer of an earnest deposit on the sale of a home.
Domina, during his closing argument, said the Nebraska GOP was “reckless” in the campaign flyer because Palmtag never “lost” her license — she voluntarily gave up her personal and the firm’s corporate licenses in 2019 due to a lack of Iowa business after flooding — and because her consent agreement with the Iowa commission admitted no violation of law.
“(The consent agreement) doesn’t end with a license revoked, suspended or lost,” he said. Palmtag and her firm were still in “good standing” for two years afterwards, when the licenses were not renewed, Domina said.
GOP says ads based on public documents
But, Hasan, the GOP attorney, told jurors that what the party sent out was “at least substantially true,” because the consent order read that Palmtag’s real estate firm, J.J. Palmtag, did not contest the “alleged violation” of Iowa law.
“It was a violation. The law was broken,” he said. “You don’t have to admit to being guilty of a crime for it to be true.”
Hasan said that when Hamilton looked up the status of J.J. Palmtag’s Iowa license in 2020, he found that it was listed as “canceled.”
“You don’t have to overthink this,” he told jurors. “Just read the words.”

But Domina said that if Hamilton had researched the Iowa commission’s website further, he would have discovered that Palmtag’s individual license had become “inactive” in 2019, and the company’s license had been listed as “canceled” because that’s how corporate licenses are listed when not renewed.
Palmtag, Domina said, only agreed to pay a $500 fine to resolve the matter, which she testified stemmed from a mistake by one of her salesmen, who was gravely ill.
Domina said Palmtag was being “responsible” for resolving the matter, calling it “preposterous” that she had been “irresponsible” as claimed by the GOP.
Hasan, meanwhile, said that as the supervising agent, it was her mistake that caused the fine.
“Janet is J.J. Palmtag and J.J. Palmtag is Janet,” he said.
The case took so long to get to trial because initially, the judge had granted a summary judgment filed by the GOP, thus dismissing the case.
Domina appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor that a jury, and not the judge, needed to make that decision, which led to this week’s trial.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, health officials urged parents to consider seeking one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months who live in Doña Ana County — the fourth and latest New Mexico county with cases — or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties, where the bulk of the state’s cases have thus far taken place. 
Normally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommends infants receive the first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second dose between 4 to 6-years old. Dr. Jana Shaw, a State University of New York professor of pediatrics, notes that babies gain some antibodies from measles when the mother is vaccinated, so the recommendation is often to wait until 1 year of age for the most effective protection. 
Except when there’s an outbreak. 
“If the risk is increased, vaccinating children less than one year of age is recommended; it’s safe,” Shaw told Source. And with no antiviral therapies to treat measles, “the only preventive tool we have is vaccination,” she said. “Once your child is infected, our tools are pretty limited in terms of what we can do to treat, support and help your child to heal.”
New Mexico’s cases as of April 18 stood at 63, with no new cases reported on Friday, according to a Department of Health spokesperson. The bulk of those cases —59 — occurred in Lea County. Of the total cases, 46 afflicted non-vaccinated people; six were vaccinated; and 11 had unknown vaccination statuses. In nearby West Texas, where New Mexico’s outbreak likely began, the health department on Friday reported 597 confirmed since late January, an increase of 36 since the April 15 update.
Nationwide, according to the CDC’s most recent figures, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases have been reported by 25 jurisdictions. The 2019 series of outbreaks totaled 1,249 measles infections, and were the largest in the U.S. since the CDC declared measles eradicated in 2000. 
Shaw praised the strong responses from local health departments and vaccination strategies for bringing that outbreak under control, but expressed concern about misinformation’s impact on public health.
“It was through vaccination how we stopped [the 2019] outbreak,” Shaw said. “Unfortunately, we don’t have such a strong intervention in place now, and certainly doesn’t seem to be very coordinated. I’m concerned this will continue to spread.”
Public health authorities warned about the threats of vaccine safety misinformation even before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the concerns have accelerated since then, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health professor at New Mexico State University. 
Khubchandani co-authored a 2021 paper on vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic and is currently funded by the National Science Foundation grant to further study misinformation impacts on public health. 
“It’s a complicated problem, and I think it needs urgent action at the local, regional and global levels,” he told Source. “We have seen, in the meanwhile, that the rise of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy proliferates at a faster rate than awareness campaigns for vaccination.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-462294288-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

Credit: Getty ImagesIn 2018, the Florida Legislature reacted to the mass shooting in Parkland by passing major safety regulations. Chances for a such a response to Thursday’s shootings at Florida State University are slim.
That doesn’t mean legislators are ignoring the politics of guns.
Start with Miami Republican state Sen. Illeana Garcia, who joined with three Senate Democrats in a committee vote last month rejecting a proposal sponsored by then-GOP Sen. Randy Fine (SB 814) to allow concealed weapons on college and university campuses.
“I have zero regret,” Garcia said on X late Thursday night about that vote, in which she joined with Democratic Sens. Jason Pizzo, Mack Bernard, and Carlos Guillermo Smith in opposing the proposal. Two other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were absent for the vote.
“Proud to have voted against your moronic campus carry bill, that didn’t have a house companion,” Garcia said, referring to Fine. “This decision wasn’t about partisan politics; it was rooted in common sense. The incident at FSU was tragic, but the real issue lies not with the firearm itself, but with the factors that led to it. The individual involved was the child of a deputy sheriff and had knowledge of weapon handling, yet chose to act recklessly.”
Fine noted the vote in a posting on X on Friday, where he included an excerpt of his speech in the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 25.
“There is no magic force field that keeps guns from coming onto our college campuses,” he said. “Less than one month ago, in my last bill presentation as a Florida Senator, I attempted to give adults the same right to protect themselves on campus as they have off. My four-minute closing speech is below. For the first and only time in 8.5 years in the Legislature, I failed. By a vote of 3-4, with two absent, the committee voted to keep universities ‘gun-free zones.’ An offensive name given what happened yesterday. The no vote included all three Democrats plus one so-called Republican. I am incredibly grateful to the law enforcement who ran into the gunfire yesterday to subdue the gunman. But in the time that took, this murderer was able to shoot seven people, two of whom have died. Today, I wonder if one of those seven had been able to defend themselves, the outcome would have been different. In any event, I will continue praying for all.”
Following the Parkland school shooting in February of 2018, within weeks the Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott came together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, a comprehensive measure that included numerous provisions regarding firearms and school safety, plus community mental health resources.
There have been attempts over the past three legislative sessions to repeal a provision of that law that bans individuals under 21 years of age from purchasing rifles and shotguns, and prohibiting licensed firearm dealers, importers, and manufacturers, from selling them to people of that age. Those measures have passed the House in 2023, 2024, and this year. In the past two years, the Senate did not pass a companion measure, and a similar measure has yet to advance in the 2025 legislative session.

The statement also said the university will comply with all laws and cooperate with authorities. 
“This is a fluid situation, and the university will monitor it closely and assess its implications,” she said.
According to the Associated Press, at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas formally appealed on Friday the federal government’s denial of funds to aid recovery from March 14-15 storms and tornadoes.
In a letter to President Donald Trump and FEMA Regional Administrator George Robinson, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the administration to reconsider its rejection of her requests for disaster declarations for individual assistance and public assistance.
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Sanders originally sought the major disaster declaration on April 2; FEMA issued its denial on April 11.
Sanders’ letter notes that “without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I
have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”
The state’s request includes Baxter, Stone, Sharp, Hempstead, Independence, Randolph, Nevada, Jackson, Clay, Woodruff, Greene, Hot Spring,  Izard and Lawrence counties.
Trump earlier this year called the Federal Emergency Management Agency “a disaster” and suggested it “might go away.” He said states could take care of disaster responses on their own and convened a group to review the agency and recommended changes.

The grant terminations came after President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions.” 

Of the 19 grants terminated in Connecticut, 17 were designated to Yale and two to UConn.
In 2024, the Yale School of Medicine received more than $598 million in NIH funding. The cancelled grants were originally for more than $42 million combined. Slightly more than $11 million was unspent when the awards were terminated.
At the University of Connecticut, the grants totaled $1.7 million, with $1 million left unspent when they were terminated, according to the tracker maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
According to the NIH grants policy statement, grant payments are usually awarded as advance payments. “The intent is that recipients draw funds on an as-needed basis —specifically, no more than 3 business days before the funds are needed,” the policy states.
Most of the research cut for both schools were of research projects that dealt with mental health and LGBTQ+ issues. Words like “sex,” “transgender,” “mental health” and “minority” were among the most commonly used words in the titles of the grants.
Some of these projects supported research on AIDS prevention and HIV, alcohol use, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These awards support departments such as internal medicine, public health and preventive medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency medicine, social sciences and engineering.

Starting May 7, 2025, travelers 18 or older nationwide must present either their U.S. passport or the REAL ID cards marked with a gold star in the top right corner to board domestic flights or enter federal buildings. International travel will still require a passport.
President George W. Bush signed a law mandating REAL IDs in 2005 in response to the security concerns raised by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original compliance deadline was in 2008, but has been delayed by the federal government several times. 
This time, federal officials say enforcement is really happening. About 81% of U.S. air travelers now have a REAL ID-compliant or otherwise acceptable form of identification, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

But Rhode Island still lags behind, with just under 62% of credentials issued by the state Division of Motor Vehicles meeting the federal standards. The state began offering REAL ID-compliant licenses in 2018.
On Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said the state was averaging 268 daily REAL ID reservations across its six offices. The DMV will issue a temporary paper ID, but it may not be accepted at Transit Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Worried about potential delays at airports, U.S. Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.) wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday asking what federal officials will do to process travelers who arrive at airport security checkpoints without REAL ID.
The TSA in January said it would conduct “phased enforcement” over two years, with the ability to issue warnings to people without Real IDs to avoid operational disruption.
“TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports, including at Rhode Island T.F. Green airport,” agency spokesperson Daniel Velez said in an emailed statement Friday.
Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Friday that the department will “ continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.”
Rhode Islanders who plan to travel after May 7 are advised to schedule their DMV appointments four to six weeks before flying in order to ensure getting their REAL ID mailed in time.
REAL ID appointments are also available at local AAA branches for members. First time applicants will be required to provide one proof of identity document such as a birth certificate, proof of Social Security, and two proofs of Rhode Island residency such as a utility bill.
If your name has changed, you’ll need to provide official documentation, such as a government-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, or adoption paperwork.
Travelers applying for a REAL ID within their renewal period, which is the 90 days before a license or ID expires, don’t have to pay any additional costs. Outside that renewal period, it will cost $27.50 to upgrade to a REAL ID.

Jared Polis speaks at the state Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed his first bill of this year’s legislative session, rejecting a bill that would have changed the state’s open records law.
“It would certainly be convenient for the Executive Branch to agree to weaken CORA, but as a representative for the people of Colorado, I support more, not less, openness and transparency,” the Democrat wrote in his Thursday veto letter, referring to the Colorado Open Records Act.
Senate Bill 25-77 was a bipartisan measure that would have extended the timeline that a records custodian has to respond to a CORA request, except for requests from journalists. It also would have given entities more time to respond to a request if they decided the request was for financial gain, like obtaining information on a large group of people in order to solicit  business.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican, Rep. Matt Soper, a Delta Republican, and Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat. Kipp and Soper ran a similar bill last year that died in a Senate committee.
“I was really hoping that he would decide not to veto it,” Kipp said. “I think it is a very fair bill that we worked for a couple years on in order to get it into a good place. We have several elements of the bill that are good for both requestees and for requesters, and I think it would make things easier.”
The bill passed on a 45-19 vote in the House and a 27-6 vote in the Senate, which would satisfy the two-thirds requirement to override a veto if the Legislature pursues one. The lawmaking session ends the first week of May.
Kipp said sponsors are having conversations about pursuing a veto override.
Polis took issue with allowing public officials to make those determinations on who the requester is and what their motives are.
“The bill leaves the custodian with far too much power to define who is and is not a member of the media, and what is and isn’t news,” he wrote. “For instance, a public official may deem a request from a media outlet focusing specifically on climate change as not meeting the statutory definitions of ‘newsperson’ or ‘mass medium’ given the perspective of some elected officials that climate change is categorically not news.”
The bill relied on existing definitions of “mass medium” and “newsperson” found in state statute related to courts and court procedures.
Polis also objected to the creation of different CORA response timelines for different types of requests, ranging from three days for journalists and 30 days for businesses seeking records for financial gain.
“A newsperson, a member of the public, and a person seeking financial gain may all request the same information and, under this bill, get access to that information on different timelines,” Polis wrote. “To ensure fairness and confidence in public transparency, all legitimate requests for public transparency under CORA should be treated equally under the law, without preference for some requestors over others.”
But to Kipp, the bill’s intention is for the government to not conduct “market research” for businesses on the same timeline and cost for others seeking public records.
The bill’s bipartisan group of sponsors and supporters had argued that the bill was intended to give public officials a reasonable amount of time to respond to an increasing volume of requests.
“People should be able to get information that they want to get. So what we’re mostly doing with this bill is trying to clarify the processes for requesters, and to give those public entities and records custodians just a little bit more time to fulfill those requests, because it’s become just an overwhelming burden,” Kipp said.
The Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition’s advocacy committee had asked Polis earlier this month to veto the bill, arguing in a letter that it would create unnecessary barriers “for people seeking to gain a better understanding of state and local government activities in Colorado.”

U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) raised more than any U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania in the first three months of 2025. From the beginning of January to the end of March, Fitzpatrick raised $1.22 million and spent just under $275,000.
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Bucks County serving his fifth term in Congress, also holds the most cash on hand of any incumbent candidate in the commonwealth. Campaign finance records show he entered April with $5.37 million, a significant amount more than other GOP lawmaker who will likely face high-priced reelection bids.
At this point in the previous cycle, Fitzpatrick’s campaign had just $1.91 million cash on hand.

Four of the top five fundraisers in the commonwealth’s congressional delegation in Q1 are being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as seats to flip in 2026. Pennsylvania is the only state that the DCCC is targeting more than 3 GOP held seats in its initial list of targets for the next election.
Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House, flipped two seats in Pennsylvania during the 2024 election.
Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, told the Capital-Star it’s no surprise Republican incumbents are among the leaders in fundraising for Q1, since they are the most competitive seats in the state.
“They will attract the most interest, particularly to hold the Republican majority,” Yost said. “I mean, if you lose those four seats, you’ve got issues nationally.”
While Democrats are placing a high priority to be on offense in Pennsylvania, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), did not include any Democratic held seats in its initial 2026 target list.
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), who defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright for the seat in 2024 by roughly 1.5 points, raised the second highest in the state’s congressional delegation for Q1. The GOP freshman raised just under $835,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March, while spending $170,000. Bresnahan’s campaign entered April with $715,000 cash on hand.
Another Republican freshman member of the state’s congressional delegation finished Q1 with the third highest haul. U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), who unseated incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in 2024 by 1 point, raised just under $675,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent roughly $165,000. His campaign entered April with $615,000 on hand.

U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who is coming off of his closest race for reelection since winning a seat in the U.S. House in 2012, raised $565,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent just under $95,000. Perry’s haul was the fifth highest in the state’s congressional delegation.
Perry’s campaign entered April with slightly less than $555,000, which is more than he had at this point in the previous cycle when his campaign had just over $360,000.
Yost said he imagines that there’s going to be “ample donors” for challengers in those competitive seats, since it is being targeted by the DCCC.
“It’s a little too soon to make any judgments about Democrats’ interest or enthusiasm, simply because you don’t really have candidates doing that fundraising yet,” Yost said.
“The normal ebb and flow is the incumbents are going to do what they can to solidify their donor base if they are expecting a challenge,” Yost said. “And we’ll know more about how competitive those races will be once we have declared candidates with the infrastructure that they need to report the fundraising.”
The only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation to not raise more than every Democrat is U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-16th District), who raised just over $125,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March.
Although the 2026 midterm elections are 21 months away, national ratings outlets indicate that the races Democrats are targeting in the state should be competitive. The Cook Political Report rates Mackenzie and Perry’s bid for reelections in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts, respectively, as “toss-ups.”
They also rate Bresnahan’s bid for a second term in the 8th Congressional District as “lean Republican,” and Fitzpatrick’s quest for another term representing parts of suburban Philadelphia as “likely Republican.”
The only Democrat on the radar of that national ratings outlet is U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District) – a race they describe as “likely Democratic.” Deluzio raised just under $250,000 in Q1, which is more than any other Democratic incumbent in the state’s congressional delegation.

Democrats begin lining up for competitive House races
While the primary election for the House is still one year away, a few candidates have already entered the 2026 race.
Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that he’s seeking his party’s nomination to face Fitzpatrick. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, a Democrat, declared his entrance into the race against Mackenzie for the 7th Congressional District in February.
As of April 18, no Democratic candidates have filed to run for the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts to challenge Bresnahan and Perry, although rematches for both races could happen. Cartwright told the Scranton Times-Tribune in January that he might run for the 8th Congressional District again in 2026, while Janelle Stelson, the Democrat who lost to Perry by 1.2 points last year, said last month that she is “seriously considering” a second run for the 10th Congressional District.
Yost said it’s too soon to tell how these races are going to shape up, but said he thinks “we can probably suggest” that the Democratic candidates “will be pretty well funded in all of these races,” as well as the Republican candidates, unless a weak candidate makes it through the primary election.
Due to the potential implications of the majority of the U.S. House being on the line, Yost thinks Democratic donors from across the country could weigh in on these battleground races. 
Evans’ future?
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) is the only member of the state’s congressional delegation to raise less than $100,000. The Philadelphia Democrat raised just under $40,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March. His campaign spent about $50,000 in Q1, which is more than it brought in during that time period.
Evans is also the only member to have less than $100,000 in his account. Entering April, his campaign had just under $65,000 on hand. The next lowest is U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a potential candidate for governor, who has $206,000 on hand.
  U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
Evans suffered a stroke in May 2024 and was reelected to another term in November. Following his illness, he did not vote for several months as he recovered. Multiple Democrats, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report in December, would be interested in running for the seat, should Evans not seek reelection in 2026.
The names the Inquirer mentioned as potential candidates included state Sen. Sharif Street, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party chair, state Rep. Morgan Cephas, the Philadelphia Delegation chair in the Pennsylvania House, and state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia). Dave Oxman, a physician, has already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District.
Rabb set up an exploratory committee in October 2023, but decided against joining the race.
The link to donate to Rabb’s exploratory committee is still active on ActBlue, although he told the Capital-Star that he set it up for the 2024 election cycle “based on persistent rumors that Rep. Evans might not run for reelection. When his name appeared on the ballot, I had no desire to run against him.”
When asked by the Capital-Star if he was actively considering a run for the seat in 2026, he said it was “too soon to say.”
A spokesperson for the Evans campaign told the Capital-Star on Friday that he “has every intention to run for re-election at this time” and “is working hard at fundraising and plans for a successful Q2.”
Evans, after a long tenure in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House. He’s coasted to reelection since winning a seat in Congress and according to national ratings outlets, represents a safe Democratic district.
Yost said since it’s not a competitive district, “the impetus for him to raise money is not the same as it is for, say, Fitzpatrick or these other candidates that are in competitive districts.”
“That’s just the reality,” Yost said.
Fetterman posts lowest quarter since entering Senate
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), raised an impressive $73.9 million during his successful 2022 campaign over Republican Mehmet Oz.
Although he’s not up for reelection until 2028, his campaign raised the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
Fetterman’s campaign raised just over $395,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent a little more than $415,000. 
In 2024, Fetterman raised $1 million in two-consecutive quarters to end the year. His lowest haul last year was $881,000 in the first three months of 2024.
Prior to this past quarter, Fetterman’s lowest total for a three-month stretch was $720,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June in 2023.

Over the past few months, Fetterman has faced pushback from Democrats and other progressives over a number of his statements, votes, and positions, including backing multiple cabinet selections in President Donald Trump’s administration. But, he holds a positive approval rating, according to data from early this year.
Yost said there’s no doubt that there are a number of Democrats who supported Fetterman in 2022 that have “soured” on him due, in part, to some of those recent votes.
Since Fetterman isn’t up for reelection until 2028, Yost believes “he’s got plenty of time to raise money, but you can’t ignore” the pushback he’s receiving from some in his own party.
“Maybe this is an early sign that he could have trouble raising money from traditional Democratic sources,” Yost said. “It’s worth following that to see if it’s just a blip, or if this is an early indicator that he may have trouble raising money like he did in 2022.”

(Photo courtesy Candice Kutrosky, NM Forestry Division)A wildfire in Valencia County destroyed three structures yesterday evening, according to a New Mexico state Forestry spokesperson. Efforts to contain the wildfire remain ongoing.
The Rio Grande Fire was detected around 4 p.m. on Thursday west of Bosque Farms. High winds and dry conditions pushed the fire east across the Rio Grande into the village Bosque Farms, state Forestry spokesperson George Ducker said. 
The fire, which started on Bureau of Indian Affairs jurisdiction is currently 10% contained, Ducker said. 
The fire spans roughly 60 acres, or less than a tenth of a square mile, and the structures burned may have been homes, Ducker said, , but a damage assessment is being conducted today. 
Fuels for the fire include grass, brush and other plants along the bosque. High winds and prolonged drought made fire risk high in the area and across the state Thursday. The fire also caused evacuations but those have since been lifted, Ducker said. 
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Ducker said, though some online wildfire databases say it was “human caused.”
Crews worked through the night to contain the fire and have since established divisions on the north and south sides of it to try to contain it further. Crews will look to increase containment and extinguish hotspots within the bosque today, Ducker said. 
Winds in the area are expected to decrease, and scattered rain showers are expected tonight. Still, the eastern two-thirds of the state, including Bosque Farms, are under a Red Flag Warning, according to the National Weather Service.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rio-Grande-Fire_Candice-Kutrosky-e1745000802891.jpg,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

Jeff Landry, flanked by Deputy Chief of Staff Lance Maxwell and Executive Counsel Angelique Freel, waits to testify at the House Insurance Committee on April 16, 2025. (Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative Republican, drew praise from liberal Democrats after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry — an uncommon spectacle that suggested the governor is staking his political fate on lowering policy rates.
Testifying in a nearly two-hour exchange Wednesday with lawmakers on the House Insurance Committee, Landry urged his fellow Republicans to break from their traditional alignment with insurance companies and vote in favor of House Bill 576, a Democrat-backed proposal that’s part of an agenda Landry has described as a “balanced approach” to the decades-old rate debate between personal injury lawyers and the insurance companies they sue. 
Louisiana pollster John Couvillon said Landry can’t really afford not to take on the insurance issue because policy premiums are by far the most overwhelming concern of voters and likely outweighs any risk associated with bipartisanship.
“If he can bend the cost curve on insurance rates, that’s something he can take credit for,” Couvillon said. “Who he works with to do it is much more insider baseball. I don’t know if that kind of perception would matter with the average Louisiana voter who’s really more concerned with high insurance rates.”  
Landry has included multiple bills on his agenda that target both insurance companies and trial lawyers, but House Bill 576 could be part of a larger political calculation that affords him more opportunities for reward than risk. 
Cosponsored by moderate Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine, the bill would give the state insurance commissioner the power to prohibit any insurance rates considered “excessive” during any market conditions. Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves that the insurance market lacks competition. 
The bill applies to all lines of insurance, though Landry has focused his attention mostly on auto and property insurance rates. Spikes in homeowner premiums occurred after a series of destructive storms starting in 2020 and have been mostly limited to the coastal regions. Premiums for auto insurance have long been elevated across Louisiana, and lawmakers have struggled to identify a clear reason why, believing the problem is rooted in policy decisions. 
Landry and Brown sat shoulder-to-shoulder Wednesday as they presented the measure, which includes an amendment the governor said he wrote himself and modeled after a law in Mississippi. Louisiana’s neighbor has average auto insurance rates that are nearly half the amount of Louisiana’s, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Brown’s bill cleared the committee in a 13-4 vote but still has a ways to go before final passage, and Landry’s office would not say if the governor will continue to shepherd the bill over each subsequent hurdle.  
“It certainly helped that the governor was there to support it,” Brown said in an interview, adding that he hopes Landry will testify at subsequent hearings. He thinks the governor has sent a clear enough message to Republican lawmakers about what they need to vote for.
Landry paired his appearance with rhetoric that potentially puts him at odds with his own party, which has traditionally favored pro-capitalist narratives.
Louisiana lawmakers dissect personal injury laws as attorney-legislators protest

“We’re losing sight of something that’s been going on in this country for quite some time, and that is consolidation … That is exactly why we need this law,” Landry said, “because we have allowed corporations to control large market shares in violation of Sherman [Antitrust Act] again and again.”
Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890 to establish rules for competitive trade and prevent unfair monopolies. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge and New Orleans Reps. Matt Willard and Mandie Landry, all Democrats, thanked the governor for putting effort into the issue and trying to hold insurance companies accountable. They joined Landry in arguing tort reform legislation, which is based on the idea that trial lawyers have an unfair advantage in court, has not worked.
One of the four Republicans who voted against the Brown bill, Rep. Jay Gallé of Mandeville, told his colleagues it would undermine “all free market principles” of supply and demand and ultimately discourage new insurance companies from coming to Louisiana. He argued it would give the insurance commissioner sole authority to arbitrarily decide rates. 
Brown clarified the commissioner would only be able to approve or reject rates, not set them. The governor argued Louisiana could never have a “free market” for insurance because the law requires drivers and homeowners to have coverage.  
“The free market rules do not apply when the consumer is mandated to buy something,” Gov. Landry said.
In a later interview, Gallé said he was in an uncomfortable situation having to choose between supporting his party leader versus following his conscience and beliefs. 
“When it is a quote-unquote ‘governor’s bill,’ the pressure is already on you, and when he takes the time to come and sit in the room that adds a little more pressure,” Gallé said. “I hated to go against the governor, but at the end of the day I had to go with what’s best for my district.”
Whether the Brown bill would even have an impact on insurance rates is questionable. Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who is opposed to it — and in a public feud with the governor — has said actuaries in his office have reviewed high policy rates in Louisiana and found them to be justified based on losses insurers have accrued in defending lawsuits. 
The governor’s bill would back the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on market data or rates artificially suppressed for political reasons, Temple said. 
The governor has cast suspicion on Temple’s opposition to the bill, repeating an argument Rep. Mandie Landry made earlier in the hearing when she asked the governor if he ever knew of a politician who shied away from having greater control. 
“I’ve never seen a politician not want more power,” the governor said.
At the same time, some claim the governor is focused on Brown’s proposal because he hopes giving more power to Temple would allow him to blame the commissioner if rates fail to improve. Temple’s office pointed to Gov. Landry’s April 9 discussion with conservative radio host Moon Griffon in which the governor suggested as much.
“If we … implement that here, giving our insurance commissioner those tools, and if the rates don’t go down, it’s on him,” the governor told Griffon. 
But according to Couvillon, deflecting blame away from the governor would be a more difficult task than most people realize. Voters are much more familiar with the governor than the insurance commissioner, so it would take a very effective messaging strategy to deflect any blame. 
“Voters tend to hold the governor accountable for things like high insurance rates whether it is a deserved measurement or not,” Couvillon said.
If Gov. Landry’s agenda has little effect and coverage premiums remain about the same, there’s enough time to try to recast his political fate and convince voters to overlook it before his re-election bid in 2027. The greatest risk in the governor’s calculation lies in the possibility that insurance rates continue to increase, which would be a much bigger problem for Gov. Landry, Couvillon said.
On the other hand, the insurance commissioner has said repeatedly previous reforms have started having an impact on homeowner coverage lines. On Wednesday, Temple told the committee eight insurers have filed rate decreases for 2025. 
“It is working,” Temple said. “Rates are coming down.”
House Bill 576 will next move to the House floor for consideration.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois chapter of AARP played a role in the Trump administration reversing itself and allowing Social Security beneficiaries to have the option of filing for benefits over the phone.

The continuation of phone-based filing is an about-face of a plan set forth in mid-March by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to restrict telephone services for beneficiaries nationwide. Nearly 100,000 Illinoisans mobilized against the plan by writing to Congress during the month of March. Nationally, AARP members sent more than 2 million emails denouncing the proposed changes.

In response to the widespread pushback, the SSA issued a series of updates on X, formerly Twitter, withdrawing its previously announced plan and reinstating phone services for all claim types—including those applying for retirement, Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), Medicare and supplemental security income (SSI).

The new plan now requires in-person claims processing and identity proofing only for calls flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to a press release Monday from Illinois AARP. “This is great news for older Americans,” said Ryan Gruenenfelder, senior director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Illinois.

New rule caused web crashes, service disruptions

AARP Illinois and its members came to the Illinois state Capitol on April 10 to express their frustration with the recent federal actions and call on lawmakers to strengthen SSA customer service. Members have reported significant disruptions in service in recent months, including long wait times at SSA field offices, frequent website crashes and an increase in calls getting disconnected due to a lack of available representatives.

“As a retiree, I count on my Social Security benefits, and they actually provide more than half of my monthly income,” said Sandra McAvoy, an AARP member and volunteer with the Illinois state legislature. “That income has enabled me to live independently and very comfortably.”

In Illinois, about 2.3 million people receive some form of Social Security benefits. More than 40% of Illinois residents age 65 or older rely on Social Security for at least half of their income, while around 20% rely on it for at least 90% of their income, according to AARP.

The SSA was planning to end phone-based claims as an anti-fraud measure, saying the move would strengthen fraud prevention by forcing individuals to go online or visit local field offices to prove their identities and file for benefits.

AARP said this would have made it difficult for older adults, people with disabilities and those in rural areas to access their benefits.

“The proposed changes were unacceptable,” said Gruenenfelder.

About 140,000 people age 65 and older in Illinois live more than 45 miles roundtrip from the nearest Social Security office, according to an April 8 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Once there, individuals report having to wait for hours in long lines to see an available customer service agent.

The only alternative to in-person and phone services — the SSA’s online portal system — is not a reliable option for many beneficiaries. Roughly 28% of households in Illinois do not have subscriptions to high-speed internet, according to a 2024 report from the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.

Some callers to SSA waited hours to get help

These challenges were in place long before the now-rescinded changes. But AARP said there has since been a recent “rapid deterioration” in customer service that has resulted in callers waiting hours at a time to get connected with an available representative.

According to SSA data, the agency had a busy rate of 0% in 2024, meaning no callers received a pre-recorded message when trying to reach a service agent over the phone. But in March, that number spiked to 28.4%, indicating nearly 1 in 3 callers received a message saying the office’s lines were too busy to take their call.

The sudden disruption to customer service came after the agency’s announcement in February of a 12% target reduction of the SSA workforce and permanent closure of six of 10 regional offices by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These workforce reductions were announced despite promises by President Donald Trump not to cut or disrupt Social Security payments with his policies.

In his first speech since leaving the White House on Tuesday, April 15, former President Joe Biden spoke out against the Trump administration’s latest actions on Social Security, including sweeping workforce cuts, permanent closures of regional offices and the current customer service crisis.

“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage,” the former president said in Chicago, according to the AP. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration.”

AARP celebrates the SSA’s decision to walk back its proposed changes to phone-based services, but Gruenenfelder said more oversight and resources are needed to improve the agency’s customer service moving forward.

“We’re urging Congress consistently, and the White House consistently, no matter who’s in the White House, to take actions to prioritize Social Security and protect it for the long term,” Gruenenfelder said.

Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth, and a distinctive rash, writes guest columnist Noreen Womack. (Getty Images)Montana health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed it’s the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
 People without prior measles infection, vaccination have 90% likelihood of contracting disease if exposed

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus, and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.
For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the state health department’s website. Additional information can also be found on the CDC’s website.

Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested an emergency declaration from President Donald Trump for the state, 12 counties and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians following the historic ice storm that hit northern Michigan.
If granted, up to $5 million from the federal government would be made available to help northern Michigan clean up and recover.
Local, tribal and state entities and utilities have been responding to the storm for weeks, clearing roads, cleaning up debris and repairing power lines. Whitmer also called in the National Guard to help. The state estimates that costs for responding to the storm already exceed $7 million.
Officials have said federal assistance is central to recovery in the region. U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, a Republican, and Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, supported that request.
In a news release from the governor’s office, Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan State Police, said approval of the emergency request “would bring critical federal resources to support local response operations that are still ongoing. This is a necessary step while we work toward the broader disaster declaration that will bring additional relief.”
But how does the process actually work?
 Disaster relief starts locally

After a disaster hits, local, tribal and state governments will typically be the first to respond. If they don’t have enough resources to deal with the aftermath, governors and tribal governments can request assistance from the federal government, which the president has to sign off on.
Disaster declarations are structured through a law called the Stafford Act.
“There are incidents that obviously the state needs help dealing with, because no state or community can take care of it on their own, and that’s when federal aid is designed to kick in,” said Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Weber spent a decade working on federal contracts related to water infrastructure and environmental health.
There are two types of federal disaster declarations. One is an emergency declaration, which the president decides on and which doesn’t have to meet any threshold.
The other is a major disaster declaration, which often requires a damage assessment to determine if an area is eligible. (In situations where it’s clear that federal assistance will be required, officials don’t have to wait for a damage assessment to request federal assistance.)
The state of Michigan will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and the Small Business Administration to assess whether the region is eligible for that assistance.
 Whitmer requested emergency assistance from the president. What’s next?

It’s up to President Trump to decide whether or not to grant that relief, which usually goes to local entities to help with cleanup and recovery.
In an emailed statement to IPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The Trump administration is closely tracking the situation and is working with state and local officials to assess what next steps are needed.”
Emergency declarations are typically processed pretty quickly because they don’t need to meet any specific criteria. The goal is to get aid to the area quickly.
And that can also be a stopgap to give FEMA time to assess the damage to see if more assistance is needed.
If that is the case, the governor can request a major disaster declaration which would unlock additional federal dollars.
And unlike the initial emergency declaration, in a major disaster declaration FEMA considers a range of criteria, such as a state’s financial capacity and resources.
Those assessments begin next week.
“There’ll actually be people out there driving around to areas that they can reach, you know, going looking at things with clipboards, writing down the kinds of damages that we’ve seen in these areas, how much money it costs and how many additional resources the state might need in order to address it,” Weber said.
If the region is eligible for major disaster relief, other forms of aid can then come into play — such as cash payments to individuals and public assistance for more long term recovery like repairing infrastructure.
Rep. Bergman is urging counties to assist in those assessments.
“For us to have a chance at securing Individual Assistance and Public Assistance, we need to take an all-hands-on-deck approach,” he wrote in a newsletter from his office on Thursday. “I encourage our leaders in all 12 counties to support this effort as we work together to secure help for our communities.”
These relief efforts kick in after events like the ice storm, but federal hazard mitigation grants have also aimed to reduce the impact of future disasters.
 An uncertain future for FEMA

Uncertainty surrounds FEMA amid the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs and reshape the federal government. Trump and those in his administration have said they want to drastically reduce – or even eliminate — the agency.
The situation has been constantly changing, but Weber said there have been concrete impacts: “What we have seen is that staff and programs at FEMA are being eliminated, and aid is being slower to arrive even if it’s already been approved.”
Those cuts have reached efforts to prepare for disasters as well. For example, Grist reported earlier this month that FEMA plans to dismantle a program, passed under the first Trump administration, to help communities prepare for disasters before they hit.
FEMA didn’t respond directly to IPR’s questions this week about criteria for a major disaster declaration in northern Michigan or what the damage assessment consists of.
Still, Weber said the big takeaway is that federal aid is meant to supplement what’s already being done, so people can look to local governments and organizations for information and help.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Broken-pole-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

Here he's speaking during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Sept. 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence.
Now, 250 years later, U.S. Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts.
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.
“There are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous,” he said. “There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But King acknowledged he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:


So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)It had been many years since Phyllis Taylor, widow to the creator of the TOPS program, had sat behind the presentation desk of the Louisiana House Education Committee. 
Her late husband, Patrick F. Taylor, a wealthy oilman who had served for many years on the LSU Board of Supervisors, is perhaps best remembered for creating the program that’s now known as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students. The program began with 183 students that Taylor personally paid tuition for. After this pilot’s success, Taylor convinced the legislature to begin a state-financed version, which inspired similar programs in numerous other states. 
Started in 1989, it pays a significant chunk of tuition costs for qualified Louisiana students who attend college at state colleges and universities. Hundreds of thousands of students have paid for college with TOPS, many who would have otherwise been unable to afford an education. 
Every year, lawmakers debate tweaks to TOPS, some minor, some major. But Phyllis Taylor, a soft-spoken octogenarian philanthropist and one of the richest people in Louisiana, has refrained from weighing in — until this week. 
What piqued Taylor’s interest was House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston. It would create a flat rate for each TOPS award amount, rather than having a unique allotment for each school. 
The new rate would mean students at LSU, LSU’s two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would be paying more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would pay less. 
The bill would also create a higher award amount for high-achieving students. 
In its original state, Turner’s bill – designed to keep high-performing students in Louisiana – would add around $50 million annually to the cost of the TOPS program. That’s not a small sum as the state tightens its belt amid difficult fiscal times. 
“I come to remind everyone that we want, by all means, to preserve TOPS, even if that means that some changes might have to be deferred for a later time, because I realized that the state of Louisiana is going to be under dire fiscal constraints,” Taylor said. 
“There is more need than there is money,” she added. 
Taylor made her position on Turner’s bill clear; she’s unhappy with the proposal that would hurt LSU students, who make up the majority of TOPS recipients in the state. She reminded the committee that while they may want to reward the best and brightest, TOPS was meant to provide an opportunity for all students – not just those with the best ACT scores. 
“Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water and jeopardize a program as a whole in order to maybe provide for a few that might not be as contributing to our state as we need,” Taylor said. 
The committee unanimously advanced Turner’s legislation, though only after adding amendments that would partially close the gap for students at LSU’s main campus and undergraduate programs at its medical school in New Orleans. Members also lowered the new award amount for high-achieving students from $12,000 to $11,300. 
House Education Chairwoman Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, one of the co-authors on Turner’s bill, said she believed the amendments would lower the TOPS cost increase from around $50 million annually to $30 million to $35 million. 
Because it involves spending state money,  the bill must receive a second hearing in the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the state’s budget. 
Though Appropriations Chairman Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, acknowledged the need to keep the best and brightest in Louisiana, he said it would be very challenging to find the money to fund Turner’s bill, especially as lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut. 
“Before we go and we commit ourselves to more, I think we need to address what we currently have in front of us,” McFarland said.

‘It wasn’t fair’ 
Turner said his bill is meant to address what he sees as inequities among Louisiana colleges in the amount of TOPS assistance available to their students.
“It wasn’t fair to give this university more and not the other one,” Turner said in an interview.  “All the institutions would be treated equally.” 
The bill is being sold as a market solution: the money follows the student, who can make a financial decision about how they would like to use it. But its critics say that choice could potentially disfavor the LSU flagship campus. 
Currently, LSU students who receive TOPS pay about $5,000 out of pocket annually, while students at Louisiana Tech University, in Turner’s district, pay $5,202. 
If Turner’s bill passes, the base-level amount, which approximately half of Louisiana TOPS students receive, would be $6,000 annually. 
TOPS Performance students, who must have at least a 3.25 GPA and a 23 ACT score, would receive $6,500. TOPS Honors students, with at least a 3.5 GPA and a 27 ACT score, would receive $9,000. The bill’s proposed TOPS Excellence award, the new highest amount, would be $11,300 per qualifying student, who must earn at least a 31 on the ACT and a 3.5 GPA. 
LSU and LSU Health New Orleans students would receive an additional $700 per year on top of whatever award level they earn. 
That would mean baseline TOPS students would pay out of pocket approximately $5,770 to attend LSU and $4,755 to attend Louisiana Tech. 

For some schools with lower tuition and fees, the new award amounts would provide some students with an excess. Under present law, that money has to be applied to students’ room and board expenses, which typically are paid out of pocket. But under a law the legislature approved last year, schools have complete autonomy to raise their fees, meaning they could increase the cost of attendance to meet the new award amount — and add to their revenues. 
Increasing the out-of-pocket costs for LSU students came as a bit of a surprise after the House Education Committee held a series of hearings over the past year in which they repeatedly questioned university administrators about why so many Louisiana students were leaving the state — and why LSU was admitting so many out-of-state students. 
Lawmakers have raised this concern so frequently over the past year that LSU launched new software, LSU Insight, designed to answer questions lawmakers frequently put to the university about where LSU students live and work. They unveiled the new program at a Senate budget hearing earlier this month and with an email to each lawmaker. 
Legislators frequently raised the issue that students in their community were being offered more money to attend Alabama or Ole Miss. They then asked why LSU couldn’t offer more to keep them home — and why LSU offered thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to out of state students at the same time. 
LSU President William Tate said the university profits only about $500 over four years from an in-state student. But even with a generous financial aid package, the margin for each out-of-state student is so high that it subsidizes the tuition assistants for two Louisiana enrollees. 
Increasing out-of-pocket costs for Louisianians at LSU could lead more students to accept generous financial aid packages at its competitors, or to go to schools like Louisiana Tech or the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Any loss of in-state students would ultimately lead LSU to seek more out of state students, compounding the problem lawmakers have raised to them for months.

Feb. 25, 2025. Photo: Jim NeugerOngoing conflict over the state’s protections for transgender people is threatening to thwart the decades-long effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which had been a major focus of late South Portland Rep. Lois Reckitt.
Though LD 260 passed the House with a majority of support, it will require two-thirds of lawmakers to back the measure for it to appear on the ballot.
And at long last, lawmakers came to a resolution as to whether the song “Welcome Home” would become the official state anthem (LD 373) after the House backed down from its support of the tune.
Other votes of note:
Following a positive vote in the Senate last week, members of the House voted 77-72 to pass LD 585, which will amend language in the Efficiency Maine Trust Act so that funds currently dedicated to subsidizing heat pumps could also be used for the state’s depleted electric vehicle incentive program.
Both chambers supported the committee recommendation against legislation that would modify the pending ban on products containing PFAS to exempt certain cookware, such as nonstick pans. During the Senate debate, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who opposed the bill, noted that initially the product ban, set to take effect January 2026, included all products with intentionally added PFAS but industry reps have repeatedly “sought to undo that good work.” LD 827 was rejected in the Senate 22-12 and the House 120-22.
Legislation (LD 1185) that raises the age for someone to be able to get married from 17 to 18 passed the House 93-52 and the Senate 23-11, but not without extensive debate in the House. Some critics of the measure pointed to the ability for young people to have abortions or access gender affirming care. However, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) pointed out that Maine is the only New England state that hasn’t raised the age to 18 and referenced data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics which showed about half a dozen minors a year are married, almost entirely minor girls marrying older adults. That disparity raises concerns, Kuhn said, adding she wouldn’t want Maine to become an attractive place for people seeking to marry minors. 
Following the House vote last week, the Senate on Tuesday rejected a bill (19-15 vote against) that would have prohibited any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. Health committee chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while the intent of the bill may be to limit the influence of government in health decisions, he warned that if passed the impacts would be far reaching. Read more about the bill here. 
A resolve directing the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women to study the extent of workforce gender segregation in the state passed the House 82-63 and Senate 22-12. Labor committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who supported the bill, said the legislation addresses the persistent issue of “occupational segregation,” which hampers true gender equity. However, critic Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle) said the bill represents the perfect definition of “identity politics.”

The House and Senate both voted to back the committee’s recommendation against a bill that would repeal a measure authorizing the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to potentially grant a permit for the development of an offshore wind port on Sears Island. The bill, LD 735, would also impose limits on who could propose similar legislation in the future. 
Both chambers also voted to accept the committee recommendation against LD 969, which would direct the Emergency Medical Services’ Board to adopt rules to allow municipalities to conduct or host emergency medical services licensing training. Bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said that 15 of Maine’s counties are “ambulance deserts” and argued the bill would allow for much-needed training opportunities for volunteer medics but members of the committee said this bill is not the vehicle to solve that problem.
These bills also passed: LD 94, “An Act to Eliminate Miscarriage Reporting Requirements;” LD 415, “An Act to Support Hunger Prevention in Maine;” LD 815, “An Act to Provide Funding for Respite Care and Supplemental Services Provided by the Family Caregiver Support Program;” LD 905 “An Act to Clarify the Process to Transfer Funds Resulting from the Expiration of Unused Kilowatt-hour Credits to Be Used to Provide Assistance to Low-income Electricity Customers;” LD 1195, “An Act to Amend the Provisions of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 Governing Requirements for Self-insurers;” LD 678, “An Act to Provide for the 2025 and 2026 Allocations;” and LD 1240, “An Act to Align the Schedules for Climate Change Protection Plans and Grid-enhancing Technology Reviews with the Integrated Grid Planning Process,” among others.
Senate votes
Members of the Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Gigi Guyton Thompson of Peaks Island, Deborah Neuman of Hampden, and Daniel Piltch of Freeport to the Maine Retirement Savings Board.
The Senate on Thursday voted 21-13 to pass LD 143, which would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
Providers have said this funding is particularly crucial given years of stagnant state funding in addition to the Trump administration’s recent freeze on Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
House votes
Members of the House on Thursday voted 74-69 in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to establish that all Maine residents have equal rights under the law. Legislators for decades have pressed for an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution but have so far fallen short. In order to be placed on the ballot for voters to decide on, LD 260 will ultimately need to secure two-thirds support of both chambers in reenactment votes. 
Sponsor Rep. Holly Sergent (D-York) said the U.S. Constitution “began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given. But our national and state constitutions are living, evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe. Throughout our history, our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.” LD 260, she said, “sets Maine as a beacon that it proudly affirms the protections of the Maine Human Rights Act and embeds them in our constitution.”
But critics described the bill as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” that would “hurt biological women” (Rep. Katrina Smith of Palmero and Rep. John Eder of Waterboro, respectively).
Legislators voted this week to pass LD 875, which provides $4 million dollars this year and next to fund essential services for victims of domestic violence. As an emergency measure, it needs to be enacted by two-thirds of lawmakers in order to be made available immediately. The House voted 140-0 and it now advances to the Senate.
Republican Alicia Collins of Sidney was the only representative to vote against LD 468, which would provide an additional $1.2 million per year to the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutritional Incentives, which supports programs that allow low-income Mainers to use their benefits to buy produce from farmers. More on that here.
Members of the House voted 75-68 to back the committee’s recommendation against LD 717, “An Act to Amend the Maine Criminal Code Governing Restitution to Include the Costs of All Analyses of Suspected Illegal Drugs.”

Thursday, a gunman killed two people near the FSU student union and six people were hospitalized. Law enforcement has 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, son of a Leon county sheriff’s deputy, in custody.
DeSantis ordered flags at half-staff “in memory of the lives lost in this tragedy and to recognize the bravery shown by the first responders.”
Two people dead, six injured, suspect in custody after FSU shooting

Thursday, DeSantis said that “this killer must and will be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law,” calling it a “tragic attack.”
Authorities responded “almost immediately,” and “engaged, neutralized, and apprehended” the shooter, Tallahassee Police Department Chief Lawrence Revell said during a press conference Thursday afternoon, joined by officials from the FBI, FSU Police, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and university administrators.
Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare said two patients from the shooting are expected to be discharged Friday, while three are in good condition and another remains in fair condition.
FSU canceled classes Friday and sporting events until Sunday.
Lawmakers and university officials from across the state have flooded social media with statements in support of the FSU community following the shooting.

Alex Andrade, a Republican representing parts of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, speaks to reporters on April 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)There have been additional resignations at the embattled Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit affiliated with Hope Florida, the initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Hope Florida Foundation President Joshua Hay announced Thursday that Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who had been working with the foundation on completing its delinquent paperwork, had submitted his resignation.
“I know his name has come up regarding some things but, nonetheless, in my interactions, I’ve had pleasurable, nothing short of pleasurable experiences with him working on drafting the documents, getting actions cured, and also just trying to sort of brainstorm it on how we mitigate these instances of noncompliance going. So, thank you,” Hay said.
Hay was referencing comments made by House Health Care Budget Committee Chair Rep. Alex Andrade that he was “flabbergasted” to learn Jazil was working with the foundation to produce documents nonprofits are required to produce but that the board had not. The House has been probing the finances and other problems involving the foundation.
Jazil is a private attorney who frequently represents the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis in litigation and also served as an attorney for the political committee Keep Florida Clean, which campaigned against last year’s pot-legalization proposed constitutional amendment. The committee was run by James Uthemeir, former chief of staff to Ron DeSantis. Uthemeir is now state attorney general.
The Hope Florida Foundation received a $10 million one-time “donation” from health care giant Centene, part of a $67 million settlement reached with the state for Medicaid overpayments. The foundation gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to keep Florida Clean.
Hay announced Jazil’s resignation during the second part of a virtual Hope Florida Foundation board of directors meeting. He also announced the resignation of Jake Farmer from the board during the first part of the virtual meeting. Jazil and Farmer’s resignations followed news that Hope Florida director Erik Dellenback is stepping down in May.
The board’s virtual meeting was cut short  after members of the public participating posted images of Nazi symbols and pornography as well as racial slurs. Unable to control the flow of images and sounds being shared, the board recessed for several hours before reconvening.
Hay said during the second part of the meeting that he would discuss with the foundation’s accounting firm whether there was any “illicit use of funds” and, if so, look at a potential “clawback” of those funds. 
Before the forced meeting recess, Andrade told the board its nonprofit status was in jeopardy because 80% of all the funds the it had disbursed were for political purposes. “I believe that will jeopardize your 501(c)(3) status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator told the group.

(Maskot/Getty Images)Headphones on and intently staring at his screen, Hayden sat at his table reading about ice cream. He was totally engrossed in the test’s content, his lips moving  silently with the narrator’s voice.
Some of my 5th graders  sat at single desks to better focus as they read, others wore unplugged headphones to block out noise, and still others like Hayden readied their text-to-speech (TTS) settings on their devices to begin their read-along sessions.
Each student had the tools and options they needed to be successful in this most important task: reading.
When I walked by to check on Hayden, he gave me a thumbs up as he began answering explicit and inferential questions, a tough skill for any 5th grader.
Students like Hayden with learning differences make up about 23% of all students in Arkansas. Once they’ve put in the work to learn how to use tools like TTS, the results are remarkable.
Texthelp tools like Read&Write and Equatio, which are  provided by the Arkansas Department of Education’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, help bridge the learning and literacy gaps for  students in grades 3-12.
Research shows that students with learning differences demonstrate increased comprehension scores when using text-to-speech technology on reading tests. This includes students with a range of learning differences, including dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and vision impairment.
The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which is administered each spring, was designed to assess students on state standards for math, science, reading, language, and writing.
Cohorts of teachers vetted the assessment prior to its adoption in the 2023-24 academic year to ensure its alignment with Arkansas standards and rigor in the question types. However, assistive technology that is part of daily instruction in a classroom like mine is not allowed on state testing for students on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) like Hayden.
As of 2023, 30 states allow for text-to-speech access on state testing for students with documented disabilities who use such  resources in their daily learning. Arkansas should join these states so every student has the opportunity to consistently use the same assistive technology across their daily tasks and the state test that measures what they know and can do.
Providing this crucial learning tool to Arkansas students on the ATLAS test would boost their reading confidence and reduce stress associated with high-stakes testing. For example, one of my students uses speech-to-text to capture his ideas on longer writing assignments, thereby overcoming the negative impacts of dysgraphia, a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language. He is able to bridge this neurological barrier and successfully express himself.
Students like Hayden find success in my classroom by leveraging the tools and resources available to them, which rewards  their effort and fuels their desire to succeed. By removing the barrier for Hayden to decode words, I can evaluate what he comprehends in the writing he produces and adjust my instruction accordingly. I can also support Hayden  in improving his decoding skills through individualized reading interventions, so that he eventually won’t  need the text-to-speech tool.
Having consistency in students’ use of assistive technology also helps teachers like me, who rely on assessment data to adjust instruction and implement interventions and supports. I spend time using this data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of incoming students each fall.
If TTS is allowed on state testing, we can ensure our instructional shifts are effective and efficient from year to year.
With the support of TTS, Hayden is growing more and more confident and is able to answer complex questions at grade level. All students should have the opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a way that does not create feelings of inadequacy and failure.  Giving students access to  these tools on state tests would empower them and help them  reach their full potential.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Student-with-headphones-Getty-041825-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002
