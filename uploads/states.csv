Forever War, Part 1: This story is published in partnership with The Assembly and with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the first in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina. 
OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.
But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.
Donovan felt devastated and enraged.
“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”
In 2013, scientists first discovered several types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.
The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians with high levels of toxic PFAS.
It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality  to regulate the compounds.


Many went to Congress and to court. Clean Cape Fear pleaded its case to  the United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”


Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found the compounds in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost and sewage sludge.
Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.
Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.
The celebration was brief.
Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin, with support from the chemical industry, was dismantling those hard-won protections.
And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.
“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”
2013-2016: A Movement Is Born
The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.
On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was sending PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.
Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”
Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.
In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.
Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.
Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.
“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”
The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.
As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.
We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.
When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.
Then a freelance reporter for the Star-News of Wilmington, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings about GenX in the city’s drinking water.
People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.
“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”
2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear 
Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.
She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.
In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.
The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.
In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.
Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.
2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature
Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank  water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.
Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.
Yet after a contentious Environmental Review Commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another hearing.
Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”
Davis, the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.
Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.
Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: A $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.
“We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”
— State Rep. Deb Butler

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.
“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”


2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer
Brian Long, then the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.
It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.
“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”
EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the thyroid, liver and kidneys.
Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.
Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer, also associated with GenX exposure.
Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.
Several advocates’ families were touched by disorders they felt might have been linked to          PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.
Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.
Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.
She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”
One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.
“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.
The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”
2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal 
Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:
Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin. 
Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.
Steer the tired alligator to the bank. 
Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).
Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.
Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators spend their long lives in water often polluted with chemicals; they can serve as models for detecting human health problems caused by contamination.
The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 different PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS  would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.
It had been more than a year since the contamination had become public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.
Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.
“We sued,” Burdette said.
SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act by discharging PFAS, including GenX, into the Cape Fear River.
By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.
“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”
By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.
No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.
DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.
“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”
In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.
“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”
Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.
“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”
At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.
“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”
Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”
Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.
2021-2022: Quest for Accountability
One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.
Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.
Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.
In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.
“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”
The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.
In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.
The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.
2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers
Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.
Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA and environmental advocates had become impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.
He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.
Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.
“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”
Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.
“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”
Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.
Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”
Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.
“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“
The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $1 billion to help utilities in small or disadvantaged communities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, yet that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.
In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.
Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.
Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.
May 2025: The Persistent Republican
It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.
“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”
Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.
If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.
“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”
A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.
“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”
Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.
The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.
Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.
“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”
With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.
May 2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained
A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.
The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.
Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.
Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.
After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.
“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.
“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”
June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill
Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.
A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”
“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”
The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.
Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.
Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.
The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.
September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX for Rollback
In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.
“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”
The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it allegedly did so out of sequence.
The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.
Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”
The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period. More than 120,000 comments were submitted, including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.
The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.
Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.
A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”
The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.
Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.
The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.
However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.
EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.
More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.
It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”
Regardless of what happens at the federal level, a DEQ spokesperson said the agency will continue to enforce the consent order. It is also gathering data from public water systems to help them meet the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline of 2031.
Accounting for private wells and public drinking water systems, DEQ estimates 3.5 million North Carolinians are exposed to levels of PFAS above federal standards.
The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.
This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing. Of those, state records show more than 22,000 have been sampled and nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.
Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.
DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-13 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"At Black Business Expo, Hartford businesses make sales—and build community",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/13/black-business-expo-hartford/,"The event aims to promote the growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit and the range of opportunities.","Thursday night’s cool weather did nothing to chill the enthusiasm of dozens of Black business owners and community members who came together for what’s become a semiannual event at Dunkin’ Park.
In a room filled with music, silver balloons and plenty of conversation, people traded multiple things — food, money, business tips and more — over the course of several hours as the local Black Business Expo came to life for the second time this year. 
Some 60 businesses took part in the “Black to the Future”-themed event, which aims to promote the region’s growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit of local businesses owners and the range of opportunities under development in Hartford. 
The event first started in 2023 as part of the Black History Month outreach programming for the foundation arm of the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team. But the expo quickly grew in popularity, leading to the addition of a second expo event each year. 
“When we first opened up the registration, we had about 80 to 85 vendors signed up,” said Aisha Petteway, the executive director of community partnerships for the Hartford Yard Goats Foundation, and a lead organizer of the expo. “From then on, we knew that this was an experience that our community needed.”
That the expo has grown so quickly, local business owners told the Connecticut Mirror, shows that it is meeting a growing need. The event has helped fill in the local business landscape, smoothing over gaps and hurdles that have historically made it harder for Black and Latino business owners to find stable footing in the area.
Research over the years has shown that these difficulties are compounded for business owners operating out of Hartford’s poorest neighborhoods: these businesses can have even more issues accessing capital and navigating the process of developing an idea and gaining exposure.
Community events like the expo, organizers say, provide these businesses with a chance to connect directly with consumers. But just as importantly, the event allows businesses to connect with each other, building a community and network that allows local Black business owners to support one another.
It’s a more community-oriented model of economic development, shifting away from a traditional focus on banks, loans and capital and onto community support, social networking and shared resources. And in close-knit communities like Hartford’s, it’s a model that local residents and business owners say is crucially needed.
“To us, it’s about more than commerce,” said Petteway. “It’s about connection, and also highlighting the services, the goods and the culture of Black-owned businesses.”
Hartford has struggled to support Black businesses in the past
Minority businesses owners have faced a challenging time in Hartford. A 2012 survey of business owners conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, for example, found that the number of minority-owned businesses in the nation increased from 2007 to 2012, growing to make up 29% of all businesses by the end of the survey period. Over that same period in Hartford, the number of local minority-owned businesses made up just 20% of local businesses.  
The limited growth of minority businesses in the city has prompted additional research. One study in particular, a 2022 redevelopment study of Hartford’s Arrowhead Gateway area, a 41-acre predominantly Black community running parallel to Albany Avenue and Main Street just to the north of downtown Hartford and the I-84 corridor, offers helpful insights. 
The report’s authors noted that the neighborhood is one of the poorest in the city and has faced “significant disinvestment” as the result of the area being redlined and largely left behind after the construction of the I-84 corridor. The area then faced further neglect and decline as residents moved out and blight moved in during the 1960s and 1970s. 
But the block has still retained a strong cultural identity and sense of community. According to a small business assessment released as an appendix to the report, the Arrowhead area has become a hub for business activity as a number of Black and Latino entrepreneurs began to launch new businesses during the pandemic.

In the wake of this growth, additional support from the city could be a major help. 
“Technical assistance and financial support should be provided to support existing businesses in the area and create opportunities to grow new small, local, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC)-owned businesses,” the report authors noted.
These “technical assistance and financial supports” could include programs like microgrants, targeted programs aimed at supporting the growing number of local food and beverage businesses in the area, and the creation of an “entrepreneurial ecosystem,” a community-driven collective where entrepreneurs can support one another and collaborate on initiatives.
The city of Hartford is working to create some of these recommended programs, launching new initiatives in recent years. In 2023, the city launched a microgrant program aimed at supporting the city’s smallest businesses, defined as having five employees or fewer, with $2,500 grant awards. In 2025, the city announced the second year of the microgrant program in partnership with the Urban League of Greater Hartford, increasing the grant amounts to a maximum of $5,000.
And the Arrowhead Gateway area has been slated for a significant amount of development in the coming years, including new housing and commercial projects, as well as the first grocery store serving Hartford’s North End.
Other efforts are being driven by the community, building off of work started organically in Hartford during the pandemic. The Sto Marketplace, for example, started in 2021 as a space where Black entrepreneurs could sell goods and trade ideas, becoming a prominent business collective in the area.
One of its founders, Jennifer Wilder, says that the initiative has grown in the years since to include training and workshops and is now a partner in the Black Business Expo events held at Dunkin’ Park, one of the largest attractions anchoring the Arrowhead area. 
“We wanted to be able to fill in a gap for some of the business owners that we worked with,” Wilder said. “And it kind of just grew into this amazing experience.”
Building a business ‘family’
As she stood at the entrance of the business expo on Thursday night, Wilder noted that the event has become a transformative presence in Hartford, showcasing not only the power and influence of the region’s Black entrepreneurs but also the diversity of the types of businesses founded in Black communities. 
Wilder, a business owner herself, was there to promote both the Sto Marketplace and her work at the Big Red Book Truck, a mobile bookstore highlighting children’s books written by or starring people of color.  
A few steps to her left stood Wilder’s son, Courtenay Jackson, a clothing brand owner who was there to promote his apparel line, Eatin’. 
“There are so many cool stories here,” Wilder said of the businesses gathered for the event. “We’re such a family, so tight-knit, all growing and evolving. And as we do these events together, everyone is elevating their craft.”
That sentiment was present throughout the expo as real estate agents, cheesecake makers, candle companies, financial literacy advisors, and local artists sat at booths, speaking with customers, exchanging hugs and passing out business cards. A few women danced as Luther Vandross’s “Never Too Much” played over the speakers. 
In the middle of the room, Brittany Stokes, owner of Sophisti_Hippie Nails, stood next to her table watching people mill about, waiting for prospective buyers to approach to look at her nail art and press-on nail business. A sign in front of her stand read “Leaves are Falling, Nails are Calling.”
Stokes, a Hartford native, said that the business expo has been a valuable space for her as she continues to build her business, which was started during the pandemic. 
“The atmosphere is great, a lot of people here are people I know from around Hartford,” she said. “It’s about building relationships.”

A little further into the room, in a back area sectioned off for food vendors, business owners Lance McDougald, Gabriel Boyd, and Mike Johnson were also waiting to make their next sales. The business expo, they said, had become a powerful way for them to get their businesses started and help build a customer base.  
“It helps to meet the other vendors, the other Black and brown business owners and networking,”  said Boyd, who runs The 881 Grab and Go, a Caribbean fusion eatery on Hartford’s New Britain Avenue, with his wife. “It feels good to just be in the building with one another.” 
That spirit of connection and unity, of hustle and fellowship, is what Petteway says the event is all about.
“We want to build with these business owners,” she said. “It’s really a community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ExpoWilderandJackson-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 12:58:10.076803

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor) A Florida House Republican has again filed legislation that would reduce the minimum to buy a firearm in the state from 21 to 18 years of age.
The proposal (HB 133), sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, a Brevard County Republican, has passed in the Florida House during the past three legislative sessions, but failed to advance in the Florida Senate. The existing law exempts law enforcement officers, correctional officers, or service members younger than 21.
The Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott raised the age for purchasing a firearm in 2018 as part of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, just weeks after the school shootings in Parkland that killed 17 people.
The effort to restore the legal age for purchasing a firearm to 18 has been supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and gained momentum this spring when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that he would not defend the law after a federal appeals court again upheld its constitutionality after it was challenged in federal court by the NRA.
“If the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law,” Uthmeier said in March, not long after DeSantis appointed him to his office. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA has subsequently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its challenge to Florida’s law.
Meanwhile, another federal appeals court — the Fifth Circuit — ruled in January that the federal law banning federal firearms licensees from selling handguns to individuals aged 18 to 20 is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.
Rejected in Florida Senate
Again, the state Senate has consistently thwarted repeal — in 2023 and 2024 by then-President Kathleen Passidomo and earlier this year by sitting Senate President Ben Albritton.
Second Amendment groups have been critical of those efforts, and they are speaking out now with concerns about what Albritton might do when it comes to an implementing bill that would make the open carrying of firearms legal in Florida statute.
The state’s First District Court of Appeals ruled last month that the 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional, and Uthmeier declared five days later that, in light of that ruling, he was declaring that open carry is now the law of the state.
However, speaking during a press conference at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office two weeks later, Uthmeier acknowledged that changing the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest situation and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
In Tallahassee this week, Albritton told reporters “there are some questions” about the new policy, and that he was seeking advice from Florida sheriffs, whose political organization, the Florida Sheriffs Association, historically had opposed open carry.
‘Questions’ about open carry
“There are some questions about the Capitol, specifically, about how well guns play in or would not play in, so the attorney general has given some guidance on this, so we’re contemplating all of that, and wanting to do what’s right for all Floridians. So, we’ll just continue to think it through. We’re again seeking input from various folks who have the expertise to help us understand and we’ll see how it goes,” he said.
Luis Valdes, Florida state director for Gun Owners of America (GOA), told the Phoenix that the right to open carry has come from the judicial system, “not the Republican supermajority in the Legislature.”
“GOA will fight tooth and nail to see this repeal passed,” Valdes said Friday. “But with the same leadership still in place, the battle against the RINOs in Tallahassee continues. We will continue with our simple message of NO COMPROMISE. We will fight to make sure all Floridians, 18 and up, can freely exercise their Second Amendment rights.”
The issue of open carry in Florida made headlines this week when Publix, the largest supermarket chain in the state, declared that the company would comply with state law.
“Treating customers with dignity and respect is a founding belief at Publix,” it said. “In any instance where a customer creates a threatening, erratic or dangerous shopping experience, whether they are openly carrying a firearm or not, we will engage local law enforcement to protect our customers and associates.”
The new law also came into play on Thursday night in Tampa, when a former candidate for Tampa city council allegedly brandished a gun after getting into an argument with another person following a candidate forum for an election taking place later this month. No charges were filed in that incident.

Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.
Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.
The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.
SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.
Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.
Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”
Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) speaks at a press conference at the State Capitol on Oct. 7. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.
Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.
“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”
The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.
What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.
Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.
Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.
Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.
The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.
Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.
The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.
But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.
It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.
They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.
It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.
Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.
Most states with high incomes and vibrant job markets have diverse economies and lots of college graduates. That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.

In 2025, Towns led his team at AL.com to launch Beyond the Violence 2.0, a comprehensive solutions-journalism initiative that seeks to tackle Birmingham’s intractable gun violence. His team won 27 citations at the 2024 Alabama Press Association Awards, winning first place in numerous categories.
According to Manny Garcia, the former editor-in-chief of the Houston Landing, “Hollis thinks like a CEO but with the chops of an editor. He’s the total package.”
Towns grew up in middle Georgia and graduated from Fort Valley State University. He attended college on a football scholarship and was a standout linebacker in both high school and college. He interned at the Detroit Free Press and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and was offered a full-time job at the AJC before graduating from college. After working at the AJC, he was managing editor of the Kalamazoo (Mich.) Gazette before being named executive editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer. His achievements in Cincinnati took him to New Jersey, where he oversaw the Asbury Park Press and Gannett’s other nine properties in the state. After several promotions, Towns was named VP of  news for Gannett, overseeing more than 150 sites in more than a dozen states in the company’s East Coast operations. He most recently served as VP of news for AL.com and Alabama Media Group.
From creating APP University as Editor of the Asbury Park Press to the more recent AMG Academy, the in-house training program launched in 2024 at AL.com, Towns has consistently championed professional development. He also serves as a mentor and coach for the National Association of Black Journalists talent and development program.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar endorsed Sen. Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor Sunday, giving the two-term state senator key support ahead of the Nov. 4 election.
“For many years, we have seen the concerns my neighbors and I are facing — about public safety, housing, affordability and so much more — be met with the same tired solutions or, frankly, none at all,” Omar said in a statement. “I have seen how dedicated (Fateh) is to our city and enacting the transformative change Minneapolis residents are demanding.”
If Omar brings the full weight of her political operation, including volunteers and fundraising, she could provide fuel to Fateh’s campaign just weeks away from Election Day.
DeWayne Davis, Mayor Jacob Frey and Jazz Hampton are the three other major candidates for mayor.
Omar’s endorsement of Fateh isn’t surprising, as the Minneapolis congresswoman and Frey have a longstanding political rivalry that’s often manifested through various proxies, and they’re also sharply divided by ideology and political alliances. Frey is supportive of the police department and the city’s business and real estate establishment.
In the run up to the last mayoral election in 2021, Omar endorsed two candidates for Minneapolis mayor and urged Minneapolis residents to not rank Frey at all on the ballot. Minneapolis uses ranked choice voting.
In the wake of the police murder of George Floyd, Omar also supported a ballot measure that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety under the authority of the City Council. Frey opposed the charter amendment, which failed to pass.
The following year, Frey, who is the leader of the more moderate wing of city Democrats, endorsed Omar’s Democratic primary challenger Don Samuels for Congress, but Omar beat Samuels’ primary challenges in 2022 and 2024. Samuels’ campaigns were run by Frey advisor Joe Radinovich.
Fateh was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2020 as a democratic socialist looking to upend the establishment, upsetting a prominent DFL lawmaker in the primary. He supported a statewide $15 minimum wage and defunding the Minneapolis police after the murder of George Floyd.
In a statement, Fateh said Omar is a “fearless champion for working people and a strong voice for Minneapolis, and I’m proud to stand with her in the fight for a city that truly works for everyone.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1152812-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-13 11:59:39.808228

Though vaping was originally posed as an alternative to smoking cigarettes for older generations who grew up smoking, younger generations have begun vaping without a prior history of smoking. A recent survey showed that 21% of Missouri college students vape (Alex Buchanan/Missourian).Originally presented as a less-harmful alternative to smoking cigarettes, electronic cigarettes and vapor products have transitioned from an aid for addiction to an addiction of their own.
Vaping products were rolled out to help support a generation that grew up smoking. Over the years, however, younger generations have begun vaping without ever smoking in the first place.
According to a survey done by Partners in Prevention, a coalition that addresses student health behaviors, e-cigarette and vapor product use in Missouri college students is the highest it has been in the last five years at 21%.
Nicotine use in general is also at a high with 28%.
Brittany Carpenter, tobacco prevention coordinator for Missouri Partners in Prevention, said that she has seen vaping specifically target and affect the younger generation.
“They are potentially so much more addicted than we have seen historically in comparison to other products,” Carpenter said.
One of the main reasons is access.
Access to smoke shops, access to product use and access to more nicotine per hit have all altered the product’s purpose.
 Access to shops

If one was to look on Google Maps for a vape shop, there would be 20 smoke and vapor shops listed in Columbia.
Of those listed, two of them are concentrated in the downtown area, within walking distance of the University of Missouri, Columbia College and Stephens College campuses. Others are all within 10-15 minutes away by car.
Carpenter said that this could potentially be considered “targeting an intended audience.”
“Some of it could in fact be coincidental,” Carpenter said, “but looking at the history of the industry … proves that is in fact oftentimes purposeful.”
The vapor product industry targets young adults in more ways than one. Their bright colors and enticing flavors have been cited by users as one of the main reasons they started vaping in the first place.
According to pulmonary and critical care physician Kate Grossman, this targeting is a very effective business strategy to build an extremely loyal customer base.
“We know from people who smoke combustible cigarettes that if you start in adolescence you’re more likely to smoke as an adult, and the same holds true with vaping,” Grossman said.
 Access to products in public

Carpenter also said that the allowance of vaping in nonsmoking areas gives users more of an opportunity to use the product.
“People are able to use these products in places that they are not able to use traditional products like cigarettes,” Carpenter said.
This current access is why part of Partners in Prevention’s mission is to address policy changes and update the language to include vaping products and e-cigarettes in restrictions.
 Access to more nicotine

Not only are users of vapor products allowed to use their product in more spaces, but they may be getting more bang for their buck.
As Carpenter explains it, a cigarette contains one milligram of nicotine, whereas the majority of vaping products are not FDA approved and it cannot be known how much nicotine is in a cartridge.
It is known that the average JUUL pod contains about 20 milligrams of nicotine, giving vape users more nicotine per hit than they would get from a cigarette.
“People just don’t think about the equivalent amount of nicotine they’re inhaling just by doing a JUUL pod, which could end up being one to two packs of cigarettes,” Grossman said.
 Pro-vaping organizations are ongoing

While both Grossman and Carpenter said that they would not recommend vaping in nearly any circumstance, there are still groups that advocate for vaping as it was originally intended: as an alternative for smoking.
The Vapor Technology Association is an organization that works to defend vaping products and keep their use legal through lobbying.
The organization’s main demand is that all legislation made around nicotine products is based on science and not on fear.
According to VTA’s website, its goal for the last 10 years has been “defending the American vapor industry and the rights of adult Americans to choose their preferred vaping alternatives to cigarettes.”
Carpenter and Grossman both said that if vaping was the only way to wean a nonsmoker off, they would use it. Instead, they try to pursue other FDA approved tactics such as medications, the nicotine patch and other tobacco replacement products.
”I don’t like to hang my hat on that at all,” Grossman said, “because we do have other alternatives for quitting smoking that have FDA approval and good studies behind them.”

As Alaska’s population of working-age adults shrinks, according to economists, other demographic groups have become bigger segments of the labor force: seniors and teenagers.
Residents who are 65 and older made up 6.2% of the Alaska worker population in 2023 after steadily increasing over two decades, according to an analysis by the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development. In 2003, that age group made up just 1.8% of all working Alaskans, according to the data.
For teenagers, the two-decade trend has been different. In 2003, teenagers 14 to 17 years old made up 4.4% of Alaska’s resident workers, but that percentage dropped in subsequent years – reflecting national trends — until it bottomed out at 2.7% during the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2020. Since then, the percentage of teens in Alaska’s workforce rebounded, and it hit 3.7% in 2023.
The information is detailed in a pair of articles in the current issue of Alaska Economic Trends, the department’s monthly magazine published by the department’s research section. 
The analysis of  senior workers was written by state labor economist Karinne Wiebold; labor economist Rob Kreiger reported on the labor trends among  teenagers.
A big difference between older and younger workers is the degree of the male-female pay gap, Wiebold’s analysis showed.
For workers 65 and older, the gap is wide. Men in that age group had average annual earnings of $54,835, compared to average earnings of$38,797 for women 65 and older. 
In dollar terms, older women in Alaska earned 71 cents for every $1 earned by men 65 and older. 
The gap widens with age, the analysis found. The gap existed even in the highest-paid job category, the analysis found. Top male executives who were at least 65 years old earned $112,799 a year on average in 2024, while top female executives in the same age group earned an average of $87,514.
Statewide, across all age groups, women earn 73 cents for every $1 earned by men, her article said.
Wiebold said numerous factors contribute to the wage gap and the way it widens with age. Those might include historic discrimination, but other factors are work experience, training, education, hours worked, job and industry choice and time out of the workforce for reasons like childcare and elder care, she said.
“All of these choices and conditions are amplified with age,” she said by email.
In contrast, the male-female pay gap among teens aged 14 to 17 was very small, Kreiger’s analysis showed. On average, girls in that age group earned 96 cents for every $1 earned by boys in 2023, the statistics showed.
For the most part, teenaged boys and girls worked in similar jobs. Accommodation and food-service jobs accounted for more than a third of employment, while retail jobs accounted for 18.4%.
By working mostly in similar industries and at similarly entry-level positions, the teens “haven’t had time for other factors to influence the wage gap,” Weibold said.
Demographic shift
Alaska’s loss since 2013 of residents of prime working ages, considered to be 18 to 64, has been well-documented.
There are multiple and interplaying causes, said Dan Robinson, research chief for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Part of the reason is net outmigration – with more people moving away from Alaska than moving to the state. Another factor is the aging of Alaska’s population, he said.
There are also numerous responses to the loss of Alaskans of prime working age residents. One has been more employment of nonresident workers, he said.
Nonresident hire hit a new record in 2023, the department said earlier this year.
Increased workforce participation by teens and seniors is part of the multifaceted picture, he said.
“For teens, it’s because a higher percentage of them have been working since the pandemic, and for seniors there are simply more of them,” Robinson said by email. “It could be that seniors are postponing retirement as a result of the worker shortage, and for teens they are likely lured into the labor force by recent wage growth in low wage jobs,”
State officials and employers have also taken actions to entice more seniors and teens into the workforce.
Last month, the state marked an official “Employ Older Workers Week,” with a Sept. 21 gubernatorial proclamation noting that “older workers play an increasingly important role in maintaining Alaska’s economy and leadership in the global marketplace, adding depth in perspective, social networks, and talent.”
The proclamation mentioned the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s Mature Alaskans Seeking Skills Training program, which trains people 55 and older who might have encountered barriers to employment in the past, such as disabilities.
As for the young Alaskans, the Legislature this spring passed a bill allowing workers as young as 18 to serve alcohol at restaurants. Key support for the bill came from the Alaska Cabaret, Hotel, Restaurant, and Retailers Association, which cited a labor shortage as one of the significant challenges facing its members.
However, that labor shortage might not continue.
“There are early signs that the labor shortage is easing and we’re returning to a more normal balance between job openings and job seekers, but we’re still gathering and thinking about that data,” Robinson said.

Scott Kawasaki violated ethics law by holding constituent events too close to the 2024 state primary, a panel of the Alaska Legislature concluded in a report published Friday.
The report was published by the Senate subcommittee of the Legislature’s Select Committee on Legislative Ethics, which recommended no penalty.
Under the Legislative Ethics Act, a legislator in a campaign cannot use state funds “to print or distribute a political mass mailing to individuals eligible to vote for the candidate” if the mailing takes place during a period that begins 60 days before the primary election and ends one day after the general election.
According to the report, Kawasaki e-mailed constituents a newsletter, distributed informational flyers and held a “Picnic in the Park” event to observe the opening of his office in Fairbanks.
Kawasaki, who defeated Republican Leslie Hajdukovich in the November general election, faced only Hajdukovich in the primary, making the race uncontested. In Alaska, the top four vote-getters advance from the primary election to the general election. Kawasaki and Hajdukovich were the only two registered candidates.
Kawasaki was first elected to the Alaska State House of Representatives in 2007, and to the Senate in 2019. He ran for re-election in 2024 to represent Senate District P.
Reached by phone on Friday, Kawasaki said that “it’s just sort of disappointing to have this be said and politicized, and then it becomes a potential issue in the future campaign.”
“It was a technical violation,” he said, “and I think it was unfairly weaponized against us just because of who we were running against.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250207-Kawasaki-copy-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ legal aid group relies on remote court appearances in 22 counties in the southwest part of the state after losing its only attorney in the region in August, said Kansas Legal Services’ executive director, Matthew Keenan.
However, some judges refuse to allow virtual hearings or appearances. Others treat them as a default.
In response to inconsistent practices across courtrooms, the Kansas Supreme Court proposed a rule change to give judges a framework for holding remote appearances with the goal of increasing efficiency and access to the criminal justice system. The proposal, which is not yet in effect, has drawn mixed feelings from attorneys and judges, according to interviews and public comments submitted to the Supreme Court and obtained by Kansas Reflector.
“Kansas stands at a crossroads,” Keenan wrote in a submission dated Aug. 1. “The promise of equal justice under law cannot be fulfilled if we continue to tolerate a fragmented and discretionary approach to remote access — especially when we have the tools and technology to do better.”
While Keenan said in an Aug. 1 submission that the Supreme Court’s proposed rule offers an opportunity to ensure full access to justice, some judges see it differently.
“What we do in the courtroom is important, and it is dumbed-down when people are allowed to appear on the computer,” said Chief Judge Clinton Peterson in the 26th Judicial District, which covers the southwestern corner of the state, in a public comment dated Aug. 29 that was submitted to the Supreme Court.
“Litigants are more disrespectful. Attorneys are less professional. Remote hearings make judges look foolish and stupid,” he said.
Keenan said in-person court proceedings are the ideal, “without question.”
He said a clear and enforceable rule change allowing for presumptive remote appearances will modernize courts and better meet “constitutional mandates, public expectations and the realities of access to justice in rural and underserved areas.” 
Keenan named a number of judges, emphasizing those in rural counties with few attorneys available to represent low-income defendants, who are averse to remote appearances. He said a shift to default remote proceedings is not radical, but rational.
Kansas is staring down an attorney shortage, which is expected to worsen if attorneys continue to move away from rural areas and aging attorneys aren’t replaced by younger ones. 
 
The balance of justice
The rule attempts to balance the discretion afforded to judges while prioritizing equal access to justice. As proposed, it says a district court should hold remote proceedings or allow remote appearances if appropriate “to increase efficiency and access to the court.”
Judges would still retain discretion to deny a party’s request for a remote appearance under the rule, particularly if the request is untimely or if remote proceedings “would undermine the integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding, such as when highly sensitive, particularly dense, or exhibit-heavy testimony is expected,” the rule said.
A court should consider a remote proceeding under the proposed rule if all parties agree, the proceeding is preliminary or for scheduling purposes, the time and expense of travel for an in-person appearance outweighs the benefits, a remote proceeding would increase access to court or help address an attorney shortage, or if a party has health concerns about attending in-person proceedings.
A group of Wichita attorneys said the Supreme Court’s proposed rule “appears to lack deference to a vital component: the consent of criminal defendants.”
A defendant has a right to be present at every appearance during their prosecution, said attorneys Dan Monnat, Eli O’Brien and Braxton Eck of the firm Monnat & Spurrier in an Aug. 4 joint letter. They said the Supreme Court should add a requirement that a court should not hold a remote hearing or permit a remote appearance if a criminal defendant objects.
“As criminal defense attorneys, we contend that the defendant has a right to be present at every single proceeding or appearance in their prosecution because a simple scheduling conference can turn into a debate about case evidence,” the attorneys wrote. “An uncontested motions hearing can become a highly contested proceeding in which the fate of the defendant’s case is decided.”
Chief Judge Bruce Gatterman of the 24th Judicial District prefaced his July 30 written public comment with the acknowledgement that he frequently uses remote proceedings.
He said they are an “invaluable tool” for the only district judge in a rural, six-county district in west-central Kansas, especially for security, preliminary or procedural issues, emergencies or summary dockets. But he said he was concerned with the way judicial discretion is treated in the rule.
“I believe the proposed rule, as written, intrudes upon judicial discretion,” he said.
He proposed eliminating the list of reasons included within the rule to guide a court’s decision to allow or deny remote proceedings.
Other judges proposed tinkering with the rule’s language, favoring wording that doesn’t bind judges to hold virtual hearings. Van Hampton, a Dodge City-based attorney, wrote in a public comment dated July 10 that the Supreme Court should go a step further and make the rule mandatory. He, like Keenan, named judges who prohibit remote proceedings.
“This practice is abusive to attorneys who reside many miles away from the District and are required by the presiding judge to travel several hours to appear for a 5-minute scheduling or ‘status’ hearing,” Hampton wrote. “This is nothing less than an attempt to punish ‘out of town’ counsel for representing parties in the abusive judge’s District.”
 
Not a ‘cure-all’
The national average of attorney-to-resident ratio is around 4 attorneys for every 1,000 residents, according to the American Bar Association.
In Kansas, some judicial districts have fewer than one attorney. Two have none.
Nearly 80% of Kansas attorneys live in five counties containing about half of the state’s population. Those are Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte counties. And about one-third of attorneys in the state are over the age of 60, according data from the state Supreme Court.
While the Supreme Court’s proposed rule appears to be a “common sense” move, in Ann Sagan’s eyes, it’s not a cure-all.
Sagan is the new executive director of the Kansas State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, the public defender agency that supplies attorneys for people who are charged with crimes and can’t afford one.
“Because of the rural attorney shortage, our agency has had to pay attorneys from urban areas to travel hundreds of miles across Kansas to represent defendants in rural areas,” she said in an email. “We will face even deeper attorney shortages as more and more lawyers in rural areas retire.”
The proposed rule seems to address the problems that have arisen out of the rural attorney shortage, Sagan said.
“However, it is essential that any application of this rule by the courts is done in a way that will protect the defendant’s constitutional rights and the public’s right to access the courts,” Sagan said.
It will not solve the rural attorney shortage, she said.
 
Rural rules
The Kansas Supreme Court created a Rural Justice Initiative Committee in 2022, charging it with examining the state’s attorney shortage, which one state Supreme Court judge said has approached a constitutional crisis.
The committee considered remote hearings as a way to address rural access woes, but it did not make a clear recommendation. The committee’s final report, which was released in 2024, said it extensively researched and studied digital tools to improve access to justice in rural Kansas. It articulated some of the same issues that have arisen in the wake of the Supreme Court’s proposed rule.
“Some members advocated for a rule mandating remote hearings in all rural Kansas courtrooms,” the report said. “Others argued that rural Kansas would be better served with more attorneys living and working in rural Kansas, and a mandatory rule detracts from that mission.”
The Kansas Supreme Court proposed the remote rule change in July, soliciting public comments until August. Lisa Taylor, the public information director for the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration, said the court received feedback from judge groups and bar association committees in addition to public comments. She said that after the public comment period for a proposed rule ends, the submissions are compiled and shared with the Supreme Court. 
“The court has discretion when it decides what to do next,” she said in an email. “Among the options are to adopt the rule as proposed or with amendments, to make additional amendments and reopen it for public comment, or to take no action at all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P8230030-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

The revenue is even stronger compared to the prior year’s first quarter — about $532 million, or a 10.7% increase.
“Our state’s monthly revenue report once again exceeds expectations — proof that the strong, pro-growth foundation built under President Trump continues to fuel our economy,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “We’ll keep building on that momentum to deliver results for Hoosiers through fiscal responsibility and conservative leadership.”
The fiscal year runs from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026.
Revenue for Indiana’s general fund for September was $313.6 million higher than the same time last year — a 15.6% increase. And it was $131 million more than expected under the latest revenue forecast.
Sales tax revenue has been especially strong — up 6% in September and 9% above the prior year.
Individual income taxes over the first three months of the fiscal year have grown $205 million over the prior year, or nearly 12%.
The forecast was downgraded by more than $2 billion in early April — leading to major cuts in the state budget. Agencies generally have been forced to reduce their spending by 10%. That has led to slashing Indiana’s child care programs and laying off state workers, among other cuts.

On the far east side of Michigan, the future of fluoride in drinking water — long an ordinary practice for preventing tooth decay — has suddenly provoked passionate debate.
Public meetings in St. Clair County, about an hour northeast of Detroit, have filled with people weighing in. One man waved his Fixodent denture cream before the county commissioners, suggesting that his own experience showed what would happen if local communities stopped treatment.
“I am an unfluoridated child,” he declared, “with a set of uppers and lowers.”
Another man, speaking to the county’s Advisory Board of Health, said that personal responsibility should be factored into the conversation. “I think there are some 3 Musketeer bars, Snicker bars that should be accounted for. Some Coca-Colas.”
And a young man used his time in the public comments to address not just fluoridation, but the county medical director who’s trying to get rid of it. He accused him of grandstanding to land a job with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health and human services secretary, by making moves that “lowered the quality of life for underserved people.”
The raucous arguments were spurred by a three-page memo sent in June to the Advisory Health Board by Dr. Remington Nevin, the medical director of St. Clair County’s Health Department. It urges the department to take steps to “prohibit the addition of fluoride” to public water systems because, he wrote in bold print, the additive is “a plausible developmental neurotoxicant” — a claim that runs counter to the assessment of many leading experts and health agencies, which have long celebrated fluoridation as a public health triumph.
Nevin recommended fluoride restrictions that would apply to any system located in the county and serving county residents. Potentially, that could include the Great Lakes Water Authority, which provides water to nearly 40% of the state’s population.
Drinking water fluoridation, which was pioneered in Michigan in 1945, led to a massive drop in tooth decay. Even with the rise of fluoride in toothpaste and other products, it’s credited with a 25% decrease in cavities. But skeptics increasingly hold sway in government, as ProPublica recently reported. Those opponents include Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, who has called fluoride “industrial waste.”
Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency are reviewing their approaches to fluoride in drinking water, and Utah and Florida became the first states to ban fluoridation.
Local communities, though, are on the front lines of the fluoride wars in most states, typically deciding whether or not to continue fluoridating their drinking water by council vote or community referendum. The public conversation in St. Clair County offers a vivid example of how contentious the issue can become. Advocates from well beyond its borders are getting involved, saying that what happens in the county has implications for the entire state.
Home to about 160,000 residents at the base of Michigan’s Thumb, St. Clair County shares a watery border with Canada. Some 67% of its voters chose President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. (Kennedy got under 1% of the vote.) About 110,000 residents receive fluoridated drinking water, according to the state’s environmental agency, while an additional 6,510 are served by water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride.
In his memo this summer, Nevin, who is a physician epidemiologist, cited a state-of-the-science report from the National Toxicology Program last year that described an association between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. (The NTP is an interagency program within the Department of Health and Human Services that’s focused on toxicology research.)
Nevin also referenced a court decision in a case filed against the EPA by groups opposed to fluoridation, where a district judge relied, in part, on the NTP report in ruling that fluoride presented an “unreasonable risk.” Even as it appeals the decision, the EPA said its review of new science on fluoride in drinking water “is being done in coordination with Secretary Kennedy and HHS.”

The NTP report, though, is contested and based on limited studies involving fluoride levels that are more than twice the amount recommended by the federal government. Its own abstract says there isn’t enough information to link lower fluoride exposure with children’s IQ.
Nevin’s memo said that the EPA may take months or years to act on fluoride, but that didn’t mean local officials had to wait. “Across the Michigan Thumb, several townships have expressed a desire for similar measures,” he wrote, “and within St. Clair County, I have received a number of resident concerns related to this issue.” He recommended new regulations that would prohibit the addition of “any form of fluoride” to public water systems in the county that serve residents.
In Michigan, each community decides for itself if it will maintain fluoride in its drinking water system. But in an email to ProPublica, Nevin laid out a process where the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners could approve regulations that, in the name of public health, restrict the ability of suppliers to use the additive — in effect, enacting sweeping change throughout the region.
“Just as items manufactured in California are often subject to more stringent California environmental and health regulations, even if the majority are sold outside the state; so too could drinking water produced in St. Clair County be subject to more stringent county regulations, even if the majority is exported to other counties,” he wrote.
Whether or not this applies to any future fluoride regulations depends on the language that is adopted and approved, he added.
The state Department of Health and Human Services says it knows of no local health departments that have attempted such restrictions. In response to ProPublica’s queries, the Great Lakes Water Authority shared a May statement about fluoride, which says that the agency is required by its owner, the city of Detroit, to fluoridate its water supply. The current dosage is well below the maximum established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the EPA, the statement said, and is in line with the recommended target for oral health benefits.
The water authority, which serves southeast Michigan, didn’t address the St. Clair County proposal. And it’s unclear whether the push for broad county regulations will gain traction.
As medical director, Nevin has an influential voice with county officials and shares guidance with Liz King, the county’s health officer-director. King, however, expressed reservations about Nevin’s proposal at a July meeting of the Advisory Health Board, according to the minutes.
In a statement to ProPublica, King said: “I do not support county-wide mandates to remove fluoride or actions that override the authority of local jurisdictions, unless there is an emergent or urgent public health need.”
Nevin was new to Michigan when he joined the Health Department in his part-time position about two years ago. He soon established that he would be an active force. He describes it in an email to ProPublica as “counter-activism,” adding: “I am largely working to counter the radical agendas of many past and current state public health officials.”
At the January meeting of the Advisory Health Board, Nevin provided members with a 2022 book by Kennedy — “A Letter to Liberals: Censorship and COVID: An Attack on Science and American Ideals” — that’s critical of the Democratic Party and government restrictions enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. (To the notion that he wants to work for Kennedy, Nevin told ProPublica that it’s “baseless conjecture” and that he’s happy in St. Clair County.)
Less than a year into his tenure as HHS secretary, Kennedy’s approach was challenged by six former surgeons general who served under both Republicans and Democrats. In a recent op-ed, they said that Kennedy is “endangering the health of the nation.” His agency criticized their track records in office when contacted by ProPublica about the op-ed, saying they failed to improve public health.
Nevin has moved to make vaccine exemptions easier to get, saying in an April memo that it would “improve the public’s trust in public health.” Those efforts helped earn him a tribute signed by 10 Republican state legislators, which also highlights his fluoride recommendations. Nevin also successfully pushed for the department to wind down services at school health clinics, arguing, in part, that providing direct primary care isn’t a core function of public health.
Supporters point to his training in the military and at Johns Hopkins University. In addition to a medical degree, his CV lists a master’s degree and doctorate in public health. On his website, Nevin also highlights his ability to serve as an expert witness and consultant in legal cases that involve adverse effects from certain antimalarial drugs.
Nevin told ProPublica that past experience taught him that it can take years for neurotoxic effects of certain substances to be recognized. “I have every confidence that, in due course, fluoride will also be looked upon as a neurotoxicant that has no place being ingested,” he wrote in an email.
He added that the response he’s received to his proposal from the community “has been overwhelmingly positive.”

But there’s been strong pushback. Dr. Randa Jundi-Samman, a recently retired dentist in St. Clair County, was one of the health professionals speaking in support of fluoridation at public meetings. She told ProPublica that dropping fluoridation would be a serious hit to community health.
“You’d 100% get more decay, especially in children in low-income communities that don’t get the chance to go to the dentist every six months,” Jundi-Samman said. “We certainly will see that. We already see it in people who don’t have fluoride in their water.”
Dr. Mert Aksu, president of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition’s board and dean of the University of Detroit Mercy’s dental school, said he’s hustling up to the public meetings in St. Clair County because it’s the duty of professionals “to make sure that the decisions that are being made within our communities are being made based upon scientific merit.”
Speaking broadly about the influence now wielded by fluoride skeptics, Aksu said, “We have opened ourselves up to opportunities from misinformed people who want to use this issue for political purposes.”
At an August meeting of the county commissioners, Kimberly Raleigh, interim executive director of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition, read a letter in support of fluoridation that was signed by the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, the Michigan Dental Association, the Indiana Dental Association, the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and dozens of others.

Nevin said in an email that the dental community “must recognize that community water fluoridation can no longer be relied upon to mask the dental problems created by our neglect of poor dietary choices.”
He argues that he has science on his side. “Scientific merit favors a recommendation to prohibit fluoride,” he wrote to ProPublica. “I have every confidence this will become much clearer in the coming months, as further federal guidance is inevitably released.”
Nevin’s recommendation is before the Advisory Health Board, which also was provided a fact sheet on fluoridation from the Health Department, submitted with Nevin’s approval. If the board endorses his proposal, King may then decide whether to propose regulations, which the Board of Commissioners would then weigh, according to the Health Department. Nevin estimated that the process could take six to 12 months.
Fluoride was on the agenda for the Advisory Health Board’s September meeting, which ended early because the members failed to reach a quorum. Nevin told ProPublica that he expects it to be discussed at this week’s meeting, and that he will present additional information then.
Meanwhile, Nevin has already influenced one of the county’s townships, Kimball, which receives treated water from Port Huron, the seat of St. Clair County.
At an August meeting, where Nevin spoke to the Board of Trustees, Kimball Township unanimously passed a resolution calling for Port Huron to discontinue fluoridation and direct any funds saved to support access to topical dental fluoride treatments.
Port Huron’s city manager declined to comment for this story, saying the township has not presented the city with any resolution or request. Nevin said in an email to ProPublica that he is “attempting to address every municipality in the county” with similar testimony.
After voting on the measure, one Kimball trustee made a point to show support for Nevin, saying “we’re blessed to have him making decisions.”
Nevin, he said, has had to overcome resistance from staff “pushing hard to make his life rather uncomfortable.”
“They’re not used to leadership,” the trustee said. “They’re not used to boldness. They’re not used to maybe some male energy that’s necessary to get things done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-060619.png,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

Seven Missouri Head Start kitchens are set to receive nearly $2 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the office’s efforts to promote healthy eating and nutritious foods.
The funding comes as part of a push from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose office rolled out the “Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy” in early September. HHS said in a press release that $61 million in funding will assist more than 100,000 children and families across the country.
In Missouri, it will pay for kitchen upgrades, community gardens, bulk cooking lessons and more.
 How Head Start programs are taking on nutrition education 

July data from the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri found that between 2021 and 2023, an average of 12.7% of Missouri homes experienced food insecurity, a 10% increase compared to the period between 2018 and 2020.
That equates to nearly 780,000 Missourians. Of those, about 356,000 are experiencing very low food security, where eating habits are interrupted.
For many children, a meal at Head Start schools will be the most nutritious they get all day, 2021 research from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows.
Lunches provided in Head Start centers provided more than the benchmark levels for vegetables, grains, bread, dairy and protein foods, while breakfasts exceeded benchmark levels for fruit, grains and dairy.
On days when children were in child care programs, meals and snacks contributed to 40% of calories a child consumed that day. And in Missouri, Head Start kitchens play a crucial role in addressing increasing food insecurity rates. In April, the federal government closed five of the 10 regional Head Start offices and fired staff, although legal challenges are underway.
For nutrition coordinators across the state’s Head Start programs, the funding presented a rare opportunity for essential upgrades. Many Head Start kitchens use commercial kitchen equipment, which can cost thousands of dollars to upgrade or replace.
“The majority of our money does go directly to providing the services for the children,” said Kayla Marmaud, the community relations director for the Community Action Partnership of Greater St. Joseph. “When you have funding that goes for the children in your care directly, some of the other things are put on the back burner.”
HHS required that half of the overall funding be used for materials, supplies and equipment for farm-to-table strategies, cooking demonstrations and appliance upgrades. Another quarter of the funding goes toward food service upgrades and sourcing local nutritious foods, while the remainder of the money will contribute to education, workshops and community events.
In Springfield, Head Start staff kept a running list of upgrades that were needed. When the funding was announced, they were able to check that list and pick top priorities.
“We selected the things that we felt like were the most pressing issues, or the ones that could give us the biggest bang for our buck, knowing that this is a one-time and not continuing project,” said Kimberly Shinn-Brown, the Head Start program director at Ozarks Area Community Action in Springfield.
They plan to make food service upgrades, as well as a slew of upgrades to their Head Start locations that have residential-style kitchens. Part of that means making the kitchens easier to use and work in for their staff, Shinn-Brown said.
Ozarks Area Community Action and others are also pursuing educational programs to help benefit their families. In Springfield, they requested money to bring on a new nutrition education program aimed at Gen Z families. The program sends out tidbits of information over text, so families can more easily incorporate nutrition education into their lives.
“They don’t want to talk to someone on the phone, and they don’t necessarily want to have a face-to-face meeting with you,” Shinn-Brown said. “But they do tend to be responsive if you text them.”
“It doesn’t matter how great your resources are if people won’t use them,” she said. “So we wanted to look at how our parents are accessing information, and what are their preferences?”
Daphne Graham, the health and nutrition coordinator at Ozark Action in West Plains, Missouri, knew the organization would have five new Early Head Start centers opening this fall, and requested funds to help with breastfeeding rooms for their families in those new centers.
They also are expanding meal options for parents of kids enrolled in Head Start to help showcase some of the cooking and exposure to different foods their kids get at school. The organization also plans to purchase more than 40 vacuum seal kits to give away to families across their 22 Head Start classrooms, with plans to help families learn more about batch cooking and preservation.
“Our demographic is very low-income … families that are sometimes just barely getting by as it is, and maybe education is not something they enjoy,” said Graham. “They don’t want to sit and listen to a lecture, but they would take in so much more in-person, so that’s where our education is going.”
In St. Joseph, they are applying those same principles to build community gardens at some of their Head Start schools and to create a new demonstration kitchen that will bring families closer to food.
“With the cost of food increasing, our resources sometimes tend to be more limited,” said Marmaud. “We wanted to be able to provide an opportunity that we could have community partners come in and be able to teach people how to get the most out of their resources.”
That sort of hands-on learning is shown to increase uptake of nutritious foods, said Lauren Landfried, a dietitian and associate professor in the St. Louis University Department of Nutrition and Dietetics.
“Getting kids exposure early is hugely impactful for their future health,” Landfried said. “If the kids are able to be a part of any of this, they’re more likely to consume the food. They’re more likely to have that positive relationship to expose others, too.”
 What is needed to create more nutritious meals for Head Start?  

Although the one-time funding was a welcome start to the winter months, critics argue that the funding does not go far enough in the face of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its sister program, SNAP-Ed, which provides nutrition education and other programs that address food insecurity.
“Any funding that goes to enhance nutrition education should be applauded and celebrated,” said Clarissa Hayes, the deputy director of child nutrition programs and policy at the Food Research and Action Center. “But at the end of the day, we know that this funding is not enough and it’s really putting a Band-Aid on the issue.”
Under new requirements for SNAP, most individuals will be required to show proof of 80 hours of work, caregiving, schooling or volunteering to receive benefits. In Missouri, that could equate to about 150,000 people losing food assistance benefits.
And under a new waiver request from Gov. Mike Kehoe, the food items SNAP pays for are set to change. The changes would bar SNAP recipients from buying soda and candy, similar to recent changes made in Kansas.
“The problem is not everybody knows how to cook,” Landfried said. “The assumption is that the people know what to do with the food that they are prescribed, which is not the case. In my experience, I had to do a lot of education on how to cook.”
Both Landfried and Hayes see the reliance on other assistance like food banks increasing while families try to stretch their spending on food.
Ultimately, these one-time dollars won’t do much to address the food insecurity issues rising across Missouri, Hayes said.
“It’s not enough,” she said. “It’s very hypocritical in light of all of the other cuts that this administration has made to the nutrition safety net.”

Immigrants’ rights groups and child advocates say the new law will help parents prepare for emergencies, such as a deportation. It caused a firestorm of controversy among conservative and religious activists who said it would allow adults to traffic kids.


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children’s caregivers if their parents are deported, a measure that had provoked a firestorm of conservative criticism.
Assembly Bill 495 will also bar daycare providers from collecting immigration information about a child or their parents, and allow parents to nominate a temporary legal guardian for their child in family court. 
“We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies,” Newsom said in a press release.
It was one of several measures the Democratic-dominated Legislature pushed this year in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation crackdown in Los Angeles and across California. Newsom, a Democrat, signed several of those other bills — banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks in the state and requiring schools and hospitals to require warrants when officers show up — in a ceremony in L.A. last month. 
He left AB 495 undecided for weeks, prompting a flurry of advocacy by immigrants’ rights groups to secure Newsom’s signature in the face of intense pushback from conservative activists. The governor announced his decision the day before his deadline to sign or veto the over 800 bills lawmakers sent to his desk last month.
The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver’s authorization affidavit. Relatives of a child whose parents are temporarily unavailable, and with whom the child is living, can attest to being the child’s caregiver; the designation allows the adult to enroll the child in school, take them to the doctor and consent to medical and dental care.
The new law will broaden who is allowed to sign the caregiver affidavit, from more traditional definitions of relatives to any adult in the family who is “related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,” which includes people like great aunts or cousins. Parents can cancel the caregiver designation, which is intended to be a temporary arrangement and does not give that person custody.
Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them. Expanding who is eligible for the caregiver form, they said, gives immigrant parents more options because they may not have close relatives in the country but benefit from strong ties with extended family or informal community networks.
The legislation was backed by immigrants’ rights groups and children’s advocates such as the Alliance for Children’s Rights and First 5 California. 
“I introduced this bill so children do not have to wonder what will happen to them if their parents are not able to pick them up from school,” bill author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, said at a recent press conference. 
Critics claim strangers could get custody
But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights’ activists argued the bill would instead endanger children. 
They claimed it would allow strangers to sign the affidavit and claim the child into their care. Hundreds of opponents showed up at the Capitol by busload to rally against the legislation, organized by Pastor Jack Hibbs of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, who called it “the most dangerous bill we’ve seen” in Sacramento. Some of the blowback stemmed from false claims that the bill would allow strangers to get custody of children to whom they’re not related.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, called the legislation “a human trafficker’s dream.”
In an email, Greg Burton, vice president of the California Family Council, took issue with the fact that parents might not be there when the affidavit form is signed. 
“What are parental rights?” he wrote. “These rights are nothing if someone else can claim them by simply signing a form.”
Over the summer Rodriguez narrowed the legislation to exclude “nonrelative extended family members” but it was not enough to quell the controversy. The legislation passed along party lines.
In comparison to a fairly progressive Legislature, the governor has often positioned himself as a moderating force on child custody and protection issues, which regularly galvanize conservative activists and put California Democrats on the defensive. In 2023 he vetoed a bill that would have required family court judges to consider a parent’s support of a child’s gender transition in custody disputes. 
At a press conference last week where activists urged Newsom to sign the bill, Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants’ Rights Los Angeles, asked the governor “to not listen to the lies, to not listen to all the other stuff that’s being said about this bill.”
Newsom, announcing his decision, quietly acknowledged the controversy in a press release. He included statements he said were “correcting the record” on mischaracterizations and said the new law does not change the fact that parental rights and legal guardianships must be decided by family court judges.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020825_Duran-Family_JAJ_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

A new study shows how it’s going,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/10/proposition-36-treatment-study/,The biggest study yet on California’s tough-on-crime ballot measure Proposition 36 shows few people are finding their way into the treatment it promised.,"In summary
The biggest study yet on California’s tough-on-crime ballot measure Proposition 36 shows few people are finding their way into the treatment it promised.


It’s been nearly a year since Californians overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime measure providing what backers called “mass treatment” for those facing certain drug charges. But few defendants have found a clear path to recovery under the law, according to new data released by the state. 
Prop. 36 gave prosecutors the ability to charge people convicted of various third-time drug offenses with a so-called treatment-mandated felony, which would give them a choice between behavioral health treatment or up to three years in jail or prison. If they accept, they would enter a guilty or no contest plea and begin treatment. Those who complete treatment have their charges dismissed.
In the first six months since the law took effect, roughly 9,000 people have been charged with a treatment-mandated felony, according to the first-of-its-kind report released this month by the state’s Judicial Council. Nearly 15% — or 1,290 people — elected treatment. 
So far, of the 771 people placed into treatment, 25 completed it. 
The data reflects how different counties are using the law, with the highest number of treatment-mandated felonies charged in Orange County at 2,395. Kings and Napa counties each had one such charge.
San Diego County accounted for roughly one-third — or 427 of 1,290 — cases in which defendants chose to pursue treatment, but did not report how many were placed into treatment or completed it. 
The report notes that this missing data contributes to “a substantial portion of the drop-off” in regards to the overall number of people who elected treatment but have not yet been placed. 
Francine Byrne, director of criminal justice services at the Judicial Council, said counties are still figuring out how to implement the law — and in many jurisdictions, it can take people a while to opt-in to treatment as they move through the court process.
“It’s not acceptable that so few people are actually going into treatment,” said Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association, which supported the measure. “The goal of this ballot measure was to take that population of people who have a substance use disorder and get them help, find them a pathway out of the criminal justice system and dismiss their cases. And that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening across the state.”
Raven said that district attorneys have been trying to implement Prop. 36 based on the will of the voters, but have been doing it “with one hand tied behind their back.” 
The measure did not include dedicated funding when voters passed it, which was one of the reasons why Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed the measure. Behavioral health experts have long sounded the alarm over the lack of behavioral health treatment and staffing across California, but proponents argued that Prop. 36 would be the great “forcing function” for the state to scale up treatment. 
Since the law passed, Republican and Democratic state lawmakers requested upwards of $600 million annually to implement it. Newsom and the Legislature ultimately approved a one-time state budget allocation of $100 million. 
On top of that, Newsom last month announced that the state had awarded $127 million in grant funding to build more behavioral health treatment capacity. Those funds were made available through Proposition 47, a 2014 voter-approved measure that reduced the penalties for certain non-violent drug and property crimes and stipulated that the resulting savings would be used for, among other things, substance use disorder and mental health treatment.
None of that funding was available during the time period associated with the report, which looked at case counts between Dec. 18 and April 30. 
Kate Chatfield, executive director of the California Public Defenders Association said the data proves that Prop. 36 “is a fail” — not because people are treatment resistant but because treatment is not available. 
“There’s no indication that anything will change,” she said. “Meanwhile, proponents are spending precious county resources on prosecution and incarceration in local jails and saying — magically — some money will appear for treatment. Proponents are the ones preventing those resources from being spent on treatment.”

(Photo by Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)A private equity watchdog group hopes a recent settlement reached between Nevada and an apartment rental pricing software company marks the start of reining in practices nationally that critics say allows landlords to fix prices on rents.
Nevada Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford announced the settlement with RealPage, a real estate software firm, last month. In the settlement, RealPage denied any wrongdoing or liability of any kind, but agreed to provisions that limits the company from using nonpublic data when calculating rent recommendations for its Nevada clients.
Nevada’s suit, which had accused the company of violating the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, is notable because it was the first state to settle directly with RealPage, said K Agbebiyi, the senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that monitors the growing impacts of private equity ownership in the U.S. economy.
Though the settlement will provide “immediate relief” to some tenants, more needs to be done to rein in corporate landlords and bolster renter protections, according to the nonprofit. 
“I think this lawsuit is a good stopgap, but we need a huge overhaul for tenants to actually have rights in this country,” Agbebiyi said. 
Real estate software companies, including RealPage, have been sued by several state attorneys general and the federal government in recent years for allegedly artificially inflating rent prices. 
RealPage, and property management groups that have relied on software, have repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
Property management companies like Greystar, which manages properties in Nevada, have been at the center of federal and state lawsuits. Many of those companies have recently reached multimillion dollar settlements for allegations of using software made by RealPage to fix prices. 
Under the settlement, RealPage can only use nonpublic data to generate recommended rent rates for properties if the data is anonymized, at least three months old, and aggregated across at least 10 properties.
RealPage is also paying $200,000, which is going toward rent relief and down payment assistance programs. 
Similar lawsuits in other states are still pending. If successful, Agbebiyi thinks settlement amounts will be nominal, as in Nevada, but the cases will do a lot to chip away at the company’s ability to use its software to the detriment of renters.
Ford, who is running for governor, has called the settlement “a win for Nevada renters who would otherwise have been kept from the benefits of free market competition like lower rental prices and better leasing terms.” 
If other states get similar rulings, Agbebiyi said, “I don’t understand how it’s going to be financially feasible for RealPage to operate when the price sharing component of their software was the primary reason that people were using their software.”
Litigation could also prevent property management companies and landlords from using algorithms to artificially raise rents, but it won’t end price fixing outright without stronger tenant protections, Agbebiyi said.
Nevada is among five states PESP identified as “very risk prone” for an influx of private equity in various economic sectors, including housing and health care. 
“Where we see private equity make a lot of investments are in states where there’s not a lot of regulation that would prevent them from maximizing profit,” said Sam Garin, the senior communications coordinator for the nonprofit.
The nonprofit’s private equity risk assessment found Nevada is among the top 10 states for the percentage of single-family homes purchased by corporate investors over a five-year period. 
In order to rein in private equity, the group suggests legislation that states could take up, including: 

Adopting good cause eviction laws, which require landlords to identify a valid reason for an eviction or nonrenewal of a lease; 
Capping annual rent increases statewide at rates no higher than inflation;
Creating a landlord registry to identify beneficial ownership of all corporate landlords.

Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed legislation in 2023 that would have limited the number of units corporate investors could purchase each year.
The legislation was revived in 2025 and sought to limit investors from buying more than 100 units per year. But Lombardo killed it behind the scenes.
While Democratic lawmakers have backed rent stabilization for seniors for a one year period – also twice vetoed by Lombardo – some Democratic legislative leaders, including Speaker Steve Yeager, have opposed broader rent stabilization proposals.
The importance of being vigilant
A 2022 ProPublica investigation found rental pricing software by RealPage used algorithms, collected through lease transaction data and advertised rates, to effectively tell landlords the highest rent an apartment applicant is able to pay, and then charge it. 
The reporting has since led for a wave of federal and state actions to rein in the practice. Under the Biden administration, the  Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice both sued RealPage and property management companies that rely on its software.
“When Trump was elected, people were kind of worrying or wondering if the lawsuits would continue,” Agbebiyi said, adding that in the last 10 months there aren’t any “indications that RealPage can count on the Trump administration to help them out.”
The nonprofit has tracked at least 22 states in the last year that have “introduced over 44 pieces of anti RealPage legislation” seeking to rein in rental price fixing at the state and local level, Agbebiyi said.
Even if those efforts aren’t successful, “just the fact that it’s in the conversation, and also the fact that the efforts against RealPage are so bipartisan, I think that’s a really good sign,” they said. “It still shows that there’s still a huge movement against RealPage.”
Ford introduced Assembly Bill 44 in the 2025 legislation session attempting to regulate price fixing of essential goods and services, including shelter, food and medicine. It passed both chambers in a mostly party-line vote.
Democratic Assemblymembers Joe Dailia, Duy Nguyen, and Venise Karris joined Republicans to oppose the bill in the Assembly, where it passed 24-18. Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck joined Democrats in the Senate to support the bill, where it passed 14-7.
Lombardo vetoed the legislation, calling it “a striking case of government overreach” and “inherently broad and open to wide interpretation, likely making enforcement subjective and inconsistent.”
State-level efforts to combat rental price fixing aren’t fixed by a single lawsuit or piece of legislation, Agbebiyi warned.
“At the end of the day, all of these are fixes that can provide immediate relief to tenants,” they said.

(Photo by Feifei Cui-Paoluzzo/Getty Images)Neighboring an area that’s becoming the heart of geothermal technology in Utah, a unique development is moving forward, seeking to produce 100 megawatts of energy without using water-based tools — when fully operational. 
Last week Millard County commissioners gave an enthusiastic nod to Rodatherm, a Canada-based company, to resume construction of a generation facility partially sitting on federally-managed land in Beaver and Millard counties, near FORGE, a laboratory sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy that has been working on breakthroughs in geothermal technology.

The main difference between this technology and that of FORGE is that Rodatherm doesn’t stimulate the fracture of reservoirs to create energy, like other enhanced geothermal systems, but essentially, uses a closed-loop system with a heat pump at depth to achieve the same effect, Curtis Cook, founder and president of Rodatherm Energy Corporation said.
“It is a method by which we efficiently and at very low cost, convert heat to power,” Cook said.
The company uses a fully-isolated fluid directly in a power-generating turbine, a system that’s 50% more efficient than water-based geothermal generation, according to a news release from the company. It also promises to be competitive in cost at early stages of the project, and to have a multiple-decade life span.
“Utah in general, is very favorable for geothermal given its high thermal gradients. What that practically means, it has much higher temperatures at shallower depth, so it is much more conducive for geothermal power generation,” Cook said. 
And, the area is “very well-studied” attracting not only FORGE but other geothermal competitors, he said.

After initially losing funding for the project, Rodatherm has found opportunities with investors that highlighted their desire to partner with entrepreneurs looking for decarbonization solutions, according to the release. Current state and federal initiatives favoring geothermal investment have also played a role in the comeback. 
“A year ago, it was very different in how geothermal was being assessed, so the economics were unclear,” Cook said. “Fast forward, now under the (‘big, beautiful bill’), and the new administration’s support for geothermal, the economics of the project now look very robust.”
Michael Dabbs, vice president of corporate development at Rodatherm, said in a presentation to the Millard County Commission that the company is drilling down two miles, then two more miles horizontally in a loop crossing Millard and Beaver counties. 
“We’re looking to drill on Jan. 15. We’re fully permitted. We’ve already done some construction out there a couple years ago, but our financing didn’t quite go through,” Dabbs told commissioners. “So now we have financing, and we’re hoping to start construction this month.”
A federal environmental review didn’t find a significant impact, according to a 2023 news release from the Bureau of Land Management. The company is planning to generate about 3.6 megawatts in the BLM portion of the site for its pilot project.

(Courtesy HBO)In an act reminiscent of Mamie Till’s profound gesture of defiance, Steven Davis’ mother carried a photo of her beaten son’s face with her as she searched for answers about what happened to him, with an HBO film crew shadowing her.
Davis’ brother took the photo at a hospital where Davis, a man incarcerated in Alabama’s prison system, died in 2019 after corrections officers beat him. Sandy Ray, his mother, said she’ll never get that image of his face out of her mind.
“As many pictures as I have of him being happy, laughing and stuff – that picture overrides all the good,” Ray says in “The Alabama Solution,” a documentary six years in the making that premiered Friday on HBO and at the Capri Theatre in Montgomery.

Ray’s pursuit of information and justice is one of several plot lines in the film.
For much of the 113-minute run time, those incarcerated inside Alabama prisons tell their own stories, using contraband cell phones to capture shocking footage: rat-infested cells, overcrowded, dirty facilities with roof leaks and no air conditioning, and pools of blood in rooms where guards allegedly beat prisoners. They turn the cameras on themselves to reveal severe facial injuries.
Charlotte Kaufman, co-director of the film, said using sources inside prisons was a less abstract way to provide audiences with information they could get elsewhere.
“What the footage allows is for you to see and experience all of the truths that have already been documented in lawsuits and investigations,” she said. “But there’s something different when you actually get to see it and to connect with the people who are living the reality inside.”
Beth Shelburne, a co-producer of the film and an Alabama journalist who has covered the state’s prisons since 2012, wrote a series called Blood Money for the Alabama Reflector earlier this year. It explores some of the topics in the film, including a sharp rise since 2015 in use-of-force incidents in Alabama prisons and the spending of millions of dollars in public money to defend accused officers and settle lawsuits.

A visual statement

The filmmakers’ investigation into Alabama’s prison system began in 2019, three years after the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men and a year before the DOJ filed a lawsuit based on its findings.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

“The Alabama Solution” portrays circumstances the Justice Department details in its finding letters. The department found reasonable cause that conditions — including use of force — violate prisoners’ Eighth and 14th Amendment rights and amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
“It’s a continuous cycle of violence, a lack of accountability, and without us being able to inform society about what’s happening, these incidents are not even reported,” said Melvin Ray, an inmate and prison-reform activist in the film.
Robert Earl Council, an activist incarcerated in Alabama prisons who also goes by Kinetik Justice, calls the situation a humanitarian crisis. “We have record numbers of people leaving out of here in body bags,” he said in the film. “As long as ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] has control of the narrative, this society is never gonna understand or believe what’s really going on inside.”
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office deny that problems in the state’s prisons represent systemic constitutional violations, and the state has spent millions fighting the Justice Department’s lawsuit.
Kaufman said many of those who took risks to even participate in the documentary from prison found it important to share their faces as well as their voices.
“‘We want you to see all of us. We want you to see our entire story,’” Kaufman remembers Ray telling her when filmmakers asked if he would like to do a call without video. “It’s like, ‘Look, we’re still people. We’re still evolving. We’re still humans in here.’”
For more than a decade, a group of prisoners have been trying to tell their side of the story not only through cell phone videos but through legal actions. “The Alabama Solution” also documents those efforts.

Prisoner-led law classes

Halifax County is the name prisoners gave to a program that includes a self-taught law class. The Halifax County [North Carolina] Voters Movement in the 1960s organized nonviolent demonstrations advocating for Black voting rights, jury service and equal job opportunities. With the help of inmates who were Civil Rights Movement activists, incarcerated men started the Halifax County program to stand up for their rights inside prison.
“Halifax County brought a spark of hope, a spark of life,” Council says in the film, referring to the legal program. “Through our knowledge of the law, we were able to see more clearly things that were going on all around us that were not right.”
In the documentary, line drawings by a former inmate illustrate the group’s history and its work, which has involved filing numerous “pro se” lawsuits from inside prison. “Pro se,” the Latin term meaning “for oneself,” describes legal proceedings in which a person represents themselves, without a lawyer.
Halifax County participants say in film footage that ADOC responded to grievances and lawsuits prisoners filed by closing a prison law library and by retaliating against leaders of the group.
“That’s why these men are so brave to continue to believe in the power of journalism and the power of public knowledge,” Kaufman said. “As Melvin said to us, not in the film, but at one point, ‘I’m more afraid of what happens when they turn the cameras off.’”

Labor strike

The documentary also covers a 2022 work strike organized by people in prisons across the state. The strike gained media attention, but “The Alabama Solution” chronicles it in a different way — from the perspectives of the incarcerated, using videos they recorded at the time.
“What’s the absolute best way to beat the system where it’s going to hurt the most?” Ray asks in an organizing session the film documents. “You get them in the pocket. That hurts way more than hitting them in the mouth.”
Alabama prisons operated at 174% capacity in August, according to numbers published by ADOC. They operate with one-third of the necessary staff, according to statistics presented in the film, and depend on inmate labor to operate.
Data and information about Alabama’s prison system are interspersed on title cards throughout the film. One states that prisoners generate $450 million in goods and services for Alabama every year. Prisoners work both inside prisons and outside of them, for private companies.
“The state of Alabama continues to thrive on the bodies of Black, brown and poor white people,” Council says in the documentary. “The institution of slavery is real.”
Kaufman said people in prison are not only being asked to work practically for free but are being coerced into doing so.
“If you’re in a work-release camp and you decide that you don’t want to work, then you risk going back to one of the more maximum facility camps, where you might die or you might be placed in solitary confinement,” she said. “It’s beneficial for the companies because you have sort of a captive workforce that probably isn’t going to complain or isn’t going to put up a big fight about working conditions or working hours.”
Film footage during the strike shows prisoners talking about lack of food and unsanitary conditions, factors that led to the strike ending after three weeks.

Alabama’s solution? Build more prisons

The state’s main response to the ongoing DOJ lawsuit has been a plan to build more prisons. The film points out these new megaprisons, with an estimated price tag that has more than doubled from the 2021 projection of $1.3 billion, aren’t likely to affect overcrowding issues because they will replace existing prisons, leaving the number of beds unchanged.
Footage in the film shows Gov. Kay Ivey reiterating her support for using money from the state’s education fund to partially pay for the prisons.
The documentary also shows Ivey talking about an “Alabama Solution” to the state’s prison problems, invoking a local-control theme that has long been raised in the South, including during the Civil War and Civil Rights Movement, when the federal government or others outside the region try to address human-rights issues.
“It’s got to be an Alabama solution,” Ivey says in footage included in the film. “We cannot tolerate the alternative, which is having the DOJ take it over, turn folks loose. It’s our problem. We got to own it. We got to fix it.”

Database of deaths

While producers were working on the film, they watched the rate of deaths inside Alabama prisons double from 2019 numbers, Kaufman said. Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform group, estimates that 1,322 people died in Alabama prisons between 2019 and 2024.
The film looks into deaths of inmates besides Steven Davis, including that of Davis’ cellmate, James Sales. He had agreed to talk with Davis’ mother after he got out of prison. But he died one month before he was to be released.
“Most of the coincidences I run into don’t turn out to be coincidences,” says civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod during a scene in the film in which he reviews Sales’ autopsy report. Sherrod represented Sandy Ray in a lawsuit over Davis’ death.
Filmmakers also released a database with names and public information about deaths inside Alabama prisons.
“We kept track of all of the deaths, and we’ve created a database that pulls from multiple sources of data — federal, state, autopsies — and is informed by various sources across the institutions to track each of those deaths and try to get as much information about what caused all of those deaths as possible,” Kaufman said.
Those who worked on the documentary plan to update the database on a regular basis, she said.

Conversation starter

“The Alabama Solution” received critical acclaim after a showing at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The Montgomery premiere is among about 60 community screenings that are scheduled nationwide. Half are set for Alabama.
Kaufman said when prisons are secretive and people don’t know what’s happening inside them, it’s easy to assume they’re fulfilling their purpose of correcting behavior and improving public safety.
She said audiences will see that Alabama is spending around a quarter of the general state fund budget on institutions that are not meeting those expectations.
“Our hope is, on a very high level, to start a meaningful conversation about what we’re spending our tax dollars on and have that conversation be informed by the full picture of the harm that these systems are causing and how short they’re falling in terms of achieving the intended vision,” Kaufman said. “We’re also hoping that the public will engage with this material, and if they are moved by it, they will let their lawmakers know, ‘This is something we care about.’”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Men-lining-up-at-Easterling-for-Oct-13-2025-story-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

(Photo by Trevor Bexon/Getty Images)In June 2025, the Nevada Legislature passed A.B. 376, a bill that could fundamentally reshape Nevada’s property insurance system. Starting January 1, 2026, insurers will be permitted to exclude wildfire coverage from standard homeowners’ policies and offer it only as a separate, standalone product. As written, the legislation allows insurers to go even further by eliminating wildfire coverage entirely.
While the bill is intended to improve insurance availability in a high-risk environment, its provisions may leave many Nevada homeowners without essential protection. Some consumers may not realize that wildfire coverage is no longer included in their standard policies. Others may be unwilling or unable to pay for an additional policy. In the most extreme case, wildfire insurance could disappear from the market altogether, exposing thousands of homeowners to serious financial risk.
This legislative shift comes at a time when Nevada is facing increasing wildfire danger. Over the past four decades, wildfires have burned 18.5 percent of Nevada’s land, placing the state fifth in the nation for total land area affected. In 2018, the Martin and Sugarloaf Fires together scorched nearly one million acres. The Pinehaven Fire in Reno in 2020 destroyed five homes and damaged another dozen while residents of more than 1,300 homes were evacuated. In 2024, the Davis Fire in Washoe County destroyed 14 structures and forced the evacuation of 20,000 residents.
Meanwhile, housing development has rapidly expanded into high-risk areas. Between 1990 and 2020, the number of homes built in Nevada’s wildland-urban interface (WUI) grew by 208 percent. This was the fastest rate of WUI development in the country. As a result, many more Nevada homes are now located in areas where wildfire risk is highest. These structures add significant fuel to potential fires, making suppression more difficult and damage more extensive. Areas like the Reno-Tahoe region have seen especially fast growth, as Reno has quickly become the fourth-largest city in Nevada despite being located in one of the state’s highest-risk wildfire regions.
At the same time, the insurance market has become more volatile. Since 2018, Nevada homeowners have seen insurance rates rise by 21 percent. According to the 2025 Insurance Market Report by the Nevada Division of Insurance, in 2023, wildfire concerns led insurers to decline renewal for 481 homeowner policies, which represented an 82 percent increase from the previous year. That same year, total home insurance policy cancellations and non-renewals in Nevada surged to nearly 158,000, while insurer denials of coverage due to wildfire risk more than doubled.
In this context, lawmakers sought to keep insurers in the market by relaxing regulations. A.B. 376 allows companies to test new products outside of existing rules, accelerates approval of rate increases, and gives them more flexibility to manage wildfire risk. However, the bill does little to protect consumers or ensure transparency. Without adequate requirements for notification, many homeowners may not realize that their policies no longer include wildfire protection. Others may struggle to afford a separate policy, leaving them uninsured just as fire threats continue to rise.
Homeowners can take steps to reduce their vulnerability. It is essential to review insurance documents regularly and confirm directly with insurers whether wildfire coverage is included. Reducing ignition risks around homes by clearing vegetation and debris, especially within five feet of structures, is critically important. Strengthening homes with fire-resistant materials such as non-combustible roofing and upgraded vents can also make a meaningful difference. Neighborhood participation in the Firewise USA® recognition program is another way to improve community safety and may improve a home’s insurability. Firewise USA provides a voluntary process for neighbors to work together to reduce wildfire risks to their homes and surroundings. 
As Nevada confronts the growing threat of wildfire, the stakes for homeowners have never been higher. Insurance is a critical lifeline when disaster strikes. While lawmakers seek to address instability in the insurance market, effective solutions must balance the needs of the industry with consumer protections. Consumers must be educated about what is at stake. Without an understanding and stronger safeguards, too many Nevadans may find themselves underinsured or entirely unprotected when the next wildfire arrives. Moving forward, the state must ensure not only access to insurance, but access to coverage that protects the homes and lives most at risk.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1229661053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

Two people — Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43 — were killed in the shooting. Twelve other people were wounded. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)State Republicans had a consistent response to the awful shooting in Montgomery on Oct. 4.
From Gov. Kay Ivey down, Alabama’s white GOP elites lectured a majority-Black city about the importance of public safety.
“This simply should not be happening in our capital city or anywhere in our state for that matter,” Ivey said in the wake of the shooting.
And she’s right. It shouldn’t. But I’m not convinced that’s what they’re actually concerned about.
Power seems to be the real point of this “public safety” outrage.
What Montgomery’s critics seem to be angling for is a takeover of law enforcement in the city, akin to a proposal last year to have the governor and attorney general take over the Birmingham and Montgomery police departments. Under that proposal, a white Republican from Wilcox County and a white Republican from Marshall County would have controlled law enforcement in two majority-Black cities, denying Black residents input in their own governance.
It’s certainly not about public safety. No public safety plan is serious without a major effort to reduce the number of guns in the state. And so far, Ivey and her finger-wagging colleagues haven’t given us one.
Alabama has a gun problem. Our firearm death rates are some of the highest in the nation. In 2023, we lost 25.6 lives per 100,000 to gunfire, the fourth-highest rate in the United States. Over the last decade, Alabama has never ranker lower than fifth in the nation for gun violence.
You are more likely to lose your life to a bullet in Alabama than in New York, which is four times bigger than Alabama but has fewer gun deaths each year.
The difference is obvious. Gun laws.
New York state requires permits to carry concealed weapons. Dealers must run background checks at sale. Guns must be safely stored. New York forbids people from openly carrying guns in public. People can petition the courts to take the firearms of those who may be a threat to themselves or others.
Alabama does none of those things.
The Legislature has twice killed a bill from Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, to effectively require gun-owning parents to keep their weapons stored. Lawmakers approved a state Glock switch ban this year, which is good, but it was less a new regulation than a way to speed arrests. Legislators also passed a bill allowing people to voluntarily surrender their guns if they think they will be a threat to other people, a law that will likely be ineffective.
And none of those proposals can undo the decades of permissive gun policies that make horrors like the one in Montgomery possible. Even as they scolded Montgomery leadership over violence, Alabama’s leaders ignored their role in fomenting it.
“Unfortunately, I still feel the need for the state to further intervene in Montgomery and to have an even greater role in leading public safety efforts in our capital city,” said Ivey, who signed a law in 2022 making it much easier for people who don’t need guns to get them, and bragged about it.
“Though the blame lies with those who carelessly pulled the triggers, I continue to be troubled by the city leadership’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge they have a serious problem,” said Attorney General Steve Marshall, who was conspicuously silent in 2022 as Ivey and the Legislature got rid of concealed carry permit requirements, over the objections of sheriffs.
“Local leaders must be willing to lead in order to stop the crime and violence,” said Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, who cheered on the flood of guns in 2022, saying that permit requirements aimed at protecting safety were just a “gun tax.”
Neither Ivey nor Marshall nor Ainsworth pulled the triggers in Montgomery. But deadly weapons end up in the wrong hands because Alabama’s Republican leaders think gun ownership is a right above all others, even the right to live without violence.
And whether you agree with Montgomery’s crime-fighting strategies, it’s clear the city takes the issue seriously. Montgomery has boosted the local police budget by more than 26% over the last six years. Mayor Steven Reed noted that Alabama’s lax gun laws are a major driver of the violence. He also noted that when the city last year tried to impose a minor gun restriction to address the carnage, state leaders forced Montgomery to repeal it.
You get used to hypocrisy in Alabama politics. The senator, allegedly concerned about free speech on college campuses, wants people at universities expressing views contrary to his to be jailed. The governor who thinks the world of Alabama’s workforce thinks a whole lot less of it the instant workers show the slightest lack of deference to their self-evidently benevolent employers.
That’s what you get with a state government built to thwart the public will, not reflect it. Power matters far more than truth or consistency.
And if you want to use Montgomery’s tragedy to extend your power over Black Alabamians, then a flood of gun violence that owes a lot to your recklessness is rather useful.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memorial-for-Oct-13-2025-column-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source,"Located in Lordsburg, Lightning Dock is the only utility scale geothermal power plant in New Mexico. (BLM New Mexico via FlickrA recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.
But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?
Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.
This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.
This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.
Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.
“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.
He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.
It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.
That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.
Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.
Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.
“The really exciting possibility is what’s called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.
Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.
“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.
Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.
Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.
Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.
In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.
There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.
The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.
By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).
Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.
“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”
New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.
In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.
Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.
“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we’re hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.
Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.
At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.
“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We’ve got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”
A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.
“I think it’s a hell of an idea, but it’s a ways out,” Woods said.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Work began last month to restore the prominent memorial honoring Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, but stopped almost as quickly as scaffolding was erected behind the bronze status of the history-making Maryland native.
Work on the memorial, which was taken down for construction around Lawyers Mall and then when cracks were discovered in its columns, was stopped after contractors identified problems with the reconstruction plan, said a spokesperson for the Department of General Services, which is overseeing the project.
“The contractor has mobilized and begun reconstruction efforts,” Brandon Stoneburg, the DGS spokesperson, said in an email. “However, during the initial phase, issues were identified with the securing compounds specified and purchased for the columns. As a result, the state and its team made the decision to temporarily halt work. We are actively working with our partners and material suppliers to resolve these issues.”
Stoneburg did not elaborate on the issues. The department did not make staff available for an interview. Costs of the work were not immediately disclosed.
“Once resolved, and assuming favorable weather conditions, construction could be completed within a month,” Stoneburg said in his email.
“Our goal is to ensure that Lawyers Mall is fully restored and ready to welcome advocates, legislators, and the public to its full potential,” he wrote.
The monument has had its share of difficulties in recent years.

Designed by Maryland artist Toby Mendez, the memorial was dedicated in 1996. The 8-foot bronze statue of Marshall stands as the focal point.
Mendez incorporated the facade of the Department of Legislative Services Building — once the site of what was then the Maryland Court of Appeals where Marshall, as an attorney, argued the landmark Murray v. Pearson case that opened the University of Maryland School of Law to Black students.
Between the building and Marshall stood six columns. The placement gave the appearance of Marshall on the steps of a courthouse.
The memorial includes bronze statues seated on benches in front of Marshall.
On one bench, a statue of Donald Gaines Murray, the law student represented by Marshall. On another, the figures of two children represented in the Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka case. Marshall was the lead attorney in the landmark Supreme Court case cleared the way for desegregation of schools nationally by overturning the 19th century Plessy v. Ferguson case, which had established the “separate but equal” doctrine.
Atop the columns, an entablature inscribed “Equal Justice Under Law.” Important dates in Marshall’s career lie in a circle in the mall at Marshall’s feet.
The memorial was disassembled and removed in 2018 to allow for work on utilities running under the plaza.
Some pieces — the columns and entablatures — were stored, according to Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property.
Oversight of the monument is complicated.
The commission is responsible for the statue of Marshall as well as the figures seated on the benches. The columns, entablature and other features fall under the purview of the Department of General Services.
“It’s not exactly like art hanging on a wall,” Kintzel said
The bronze statue of Marshall was moved temporarily to the entrance of the Robert C. Murphy Court of Appeals Building.
The statue and memorial returned to Lawyers Mall in late 2020, and were rededicated in 2021. But the next year,the columns and entablature had to be taken down after it was discovered they had been damaged.

“The colonnade which serves as the backdrop to the Thurgood Marshall statue in Lawyers Mall was disassembled when concerns over certain cracks were deemed to be a potential safety risk,” Stoneburg wrote.
“While evaluating the disassembled columns to identify a potential cause for the cracks, a decision was made not to reconstruct the monument while the adjacent Legislative Services Building was being constructed to prevent potential damage from heavy equipment vibrations,” he wrote. “During this time, additional maintenance updates to help preserve this important landmark for years to come were also identified and are currently being implemented.”
One of those changes involves improving the engravings of the court cases and significant cases that are part of the paved area around the statue. Some of those engravings have suffered from time, weather, and foot traffic.
“They really wanted to emphasize the engravings and his cases with a deeper cut — trying to make it more legible,” Kintzel said. “Over time, it became hard to read some of the lettering of the cases. They began to fade over time. With this new deeper cut, the new methodology, the lettering should remain legible for a much, much, much, much longer time.”
The cracks in the columns — some significant — were discovered at the same time workers were demolishing and replacing the adjacent Department of Legislative Services Building.
The exact cause of the damage to the columns is not clear. But experts noted at the time that the monument was not designed to be disassembled and reassembled.
“Although studies were conducted to determine the cause of the original structural failure, the findings were not fully conclusive,” Stoneburg said. “The State continues to work collaboratively with the original construction team to refine the reconstruction details and ensure long-term success.”
Not all of the pieces of the reconstructed memorial will be original.
“As part of the reconstruction, the original columns — deemed too damaged to reuse — have been replaced,” Stoneburg wrote. “The new columns, fabricated to match the original profile, were designed as two-piece units instead of the original three-piece configuration. However, the original entablatures that sit atop each set of three columns have been preserved and will be reinstalled as part of the reconstruction.”
Also new to the mall: a modern Department of Legislative Services Building. The new 144,000 square-foot building was officially opened in January.
“The expanded Lawyers Mall has definitely created a much greater access to the plaza, it’s more secure…and when the columns and everything are back in place, it will then help reframe the idea that here is a space where history took place, and it will be better framed now that the new building is complete and the new bases and columns will be in place,” Kintzel said.
State officials worked with Mendez, the artist, to ensure his vision of the memorial remained.
“They consulted with Tony on the new building, so that it would still look proportional and look like it was originally intended,” Kintzel said. “So, it still has the idea of it being in the spot where, where the old Court of Appeals was, where Marshall would have been when he argued his landmark cases.”

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The company behind the proposed Piedmont power line is pushing Maryland regulators to evaluate the project more quickly than planned, arguing that delays will jeopardize the power grid.
The company, PSEG Renewable Transmission, is opposing a procedural schedule issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission, which plans to review the project until at least February 2027.
PSEG argues that the commission’s schedule will make it impossible to reach a deadline for placing the power line in service by June 2027, which was set by the operator of the region’s electric grid, PJM Interconnection.
“PJM set the in-service date to prevent specific impending reliability violations,” wrote PSEG attorney J. Joseph Curran, III, in a letter to the commission. “Unless these violations are addressed, PJM has determined that overall system reliability in the PJM region — including in Maryland — could be compromised, and the PJM region could be exposed to widespread and extreme conditions, such as system collapse and blackouts.”
The commission, by contrast, has expressed confidence that the electric grid will remain well-managed while it deliberates about the transmission line.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

In his letter to the commission, Curran also requested that it establish a target date to issue a final order on the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the power line project is known. An end date would help the company more efficiently coordinate with other state and federal permitting agencies, plan construction activities, and negotiate with landowners, he wrote.
But in a statement Friday, Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the commission, said it is “unlikely” to place an end cap on the proceedings by setting a target date for a final order. The commission’s schedule ends in February 2027 with a deadline for the parties to submit their final briefs.
The commission will ultimately decide whether the controversial power line receives a “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity,” authorizing its construction. But the process has already been mired in delays, largely because of intense pushback from landowners in the line’s path, and other community members and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions.
Because of landowner denials, PSEG had to go to court to get a federal district judge to order temporary access to hundreds of properties for environmental surveys, which it will need in order to get a final ruling from the commission.
Those surveys are well underway, though landowners have appealed. On Thursday, the company filed suit against a third round of defiant landowners, requesting access to 64 additional parcels.
By comparison, in his Oct. 7 letter, Curran said the company has obtained voluntary access agreements for 52 parcels along the proposed route.
The proposed line would stretch 67 miles through largely rural areas in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, connecting a power substation near the Pennsylvania line with a substation in Frederick County.
The project was commissioned by grid operator PJM alongside a host of other projects meant to relieve problems in a strained grid, caused in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers and expected retirements of fossil fuel generating stations.
In a statement shortly after the Maryland Commission issued its schedule for the Piedmont line, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said that “PJM has identified extensive, severe, and widespread reliability violations that PJM expects to occur as soon as June 2027 if these projects are not built on the prescribed schedule, leaving the entire system more exposed to reliability risks, including power outages.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shields noted that Maryland will be “additionally challenged to meet local demand from local sources” given the planned retirements of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants, which are currently operating solely because of “must run” agreements with the grid.
In its news release announcing the scheduling order on Sept. 11, the commission highlighted that PSEG submitted its application for the certification in late December 2024, as opposed to fall 2024 as planned.
In his letter to the commission, Curran pushed back, arguing that the New-Jersey based power company only submitted in December because it decided to conduct additional public hearings in November 2024.
In requesting an end date for the proceedings, Curran argued that it would help expedite the permits that PSEG would likely only be able to obtain after a decision on the certificate of public convenience, including from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the impacted counties.
“Having a final order date in the procedural schedule is necessary so that the Company can have plans in place to ensure the Project goes into service as soon as practical to meet critical reliability needs,” Curran wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0282-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)States are doing what they generally do during a federal government shutdown: Continuing to operate programs serving some of the neediest people.
That means schools are still serving federally subsidized meals and states are distributing funding for the federal food stamp program. For now.
If the shutdown drags on and federal dollars run out, states can only keep programs going for so long. States may choose to pay for some services themselves so residents keep their benefits.
But while it’s traditionally been the practice to reimburse states for federal costs once the shutdown ends, state leaders have new worries about whether that will be the case this time. The Trump administration’s record of pulling funding and targeting Democratic-led states has some officials worried about what comes after the shutdown.
Many states already struggled to balance their own budgets this year. And some fear going without federal reimbursement for shutdown costs could force states to make painful cuts to their own budget priorities.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat, said the administration has not made good on its word to states in recent months — freezing some congressionally approved funding and cutting already awarded grants. So it’s likewise unclear whether the federal government will follow previous practice and reimburse states for covering shutdown costs of crucial federal programs such as food assistance.
“I think everything is a risk with this administration…. We in the states are kind of left holding the bag yet again as the federal government tries to sort out what it wants to be when it grows up,” Conine told Stateline.

Nevada entered the shutdown with more than $1.2 billion in reserves. Last week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office said in a statement that state funds would be adequate to cover “a short period of time with minimal disruption to services.”
But the governor’s office said a shutdown of more than 30 days would cause more significant challenges for the state.
Lombardo’s office did not respond to Stateline’s questions. But on Oct. 1, when the shutdown started, it released a three-page document on the shutdown, saying it expected the federal government to reimburse states once the budget stalemate is resolved.
“As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown,” Lombardo said in the statement.
While mandatory programs such as Medicaid and Social Security continue to send funds to beneficiaries during the shutdown, funding for other safety net programs such as food assistance are more uncertain. The federal government told states there were enough funds for the food stamp program to cover October benefits, though the special Women, Infants and Children food program may run out of money sooner.
By furloughing workers and halting federal spending, the shutdown could cost the national economy $15 billion per week, President Donald Trump’s economic advisers estimated.
The White House says a prolonged shutdown will affect the economies of every state by reducing employment, federal benefits and consumer spending. White House estimates say this could cost Michigan $361 million per week in lost economic output, for example, while Florida could lose $911 million each week.
‘Fend for themselves’
Some federal services are shuttered during a shutdown: The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased many research, permitting and enforcement efforts, and official jobs data is no longer being released. Federal funds for other programs, including food assistance, are expected to last through the end of the month. But states can elect to spend their own funds on these programs, which were previously authorized by Congress and state legislatures.










There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown. There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.


– Lisa Parshall, professor of political science at Daemen University in New York


Before the shutdown, states were stockpiling reserve funding. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported most state budgets this year maintained or increased rainy day funds. At the same time, state and local governments are borrowing record amounts: As much as $600 billion in municipal bonds is projected to be issued by the end of 2025.
“So states and localities are kind of getting the message they really need to fend for themselves much more than they ever had,” said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that works to support public sector workers.
Since January, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Glasgall said that record leaves states with legitimate concerns about getting repaid for their shutdown-related expenses — a prospect that would likely spark even more lawsuits from Democratic-led states.
“They’ve already, before the shutdown, started rolling back federal funding, and I don’t see any reason why they would stop now,” he said. “The recissions that have been announced are pretty harsh, and it’s money we’re expecting and not getting.”
The last shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump’s first term, delayed billions in federal spending and reduced gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced — by $11 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019. Experts say states were repaid for costs they incurred providing federal services during that shutdown.
In Minnesota, State Budget Director Ahna Minge said staff have been studying previous shutdowns. But at a news conference with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz last week, she characterized this shutdown as “unpredictable.”
“The current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” she said.
Walz said farmers would be among the first hit as the federal Farm Service Agency has ceased operations in the middle of the state’s harvest season. Among other duties, that agency works on disaster assistance and processes loans during harvest to protect farmers against commodity price fluctuations.

Minge said Minnesota officials think programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children have enough existing federal funds to operate through October. But she said the state budget cannot backfill all the commitments made by federal programs.
“What we know is that the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the impact to state programs and services,” she said.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has pledged to use state dollars to keep WIC afloat if needed, the Associated Press reported. And  Colorado lawmakers set aside $7.5 million just before the shutdown to keep WIC running.
Already under strain
In Maryland, the shutdown is compounding economic instability from Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
With more than 260,000 federal employees, Maryland’s economy relies heavily on the federal workforce. The Trump administration has said it may deny back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, despite a law he signed in 2019 guaranteeing such back pay.
Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele told lawmakers on Sept. 30 that a shutdown could cost the state $700,000 per day in lost tax revenue.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore pledged to continue funding some federal programs, but said the state would not tap into its Rainy Day fund to do so.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said at a news conference.
As for getting repaid, Moore spokesperson David Turner told Stateline that the state had received no indication that the federal government would deviate from past practice, “but we are monitoring closely.”
This fiscal uncertainty hits states as they are already struggling to respond to the strain of federal agency layoffs and cuts in the major tax and spending law Trump signed this summer. That law slashed billions in social service funding and created costly new bureaucratic burdens for states, which administer Medicaid and food assistance programs.
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

“There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown,” said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York. “There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.”
It may not be a question of whether states are reimbursed for their shutdown expenses, but which states are reimbursed, Parshall said. The Trump administration has publicly targeted funding of liberal-led states and cities over policy disagreements, raising the possibility it could do something similar with the shutdown.
“Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, you know, you could argue,” she said. “But it’s definitely a thing that seems to be adding to this level of uncertainty — this shutdown feels different.”
In California, officials just closed a nearly $12 billion shortfall when negotiating the budget that was approved in June. The budget deficit is expected to grow to more than $17 billion next year, said H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the State of California Department of Finance, which advises the governor and state agencies on budget issues.
“There isn’t a long-term, open-ended line of credit available if this drags out,” he said of the federal government shutdown.
The depth of reserve funds available varies by federally funded program, he said. CalFresh, California’s name for its SNAP program, has enough funds to cover food stamp benefits for this month, but anything beyond that is uncertain.
“If the duration of this is in the matter of days, it will be an inconvenience, but should not pose a massive problem,” he said. “However, if it does drag out for an extended period of time, then clearly it’s going to be a problem.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State auditors have referred their investigation of credit card use by a worker at the State Department of Assessments and Taxation to the criminal division of the attorney general’s office, after finding questionable purchases by the employee and lax oversight by department managers.
The Office of Legislative Audits report released last week said its investigation was sparked by a tip to its fraud, waste and abuse hotline concerning questionable corporate purchasing card (CPC) purchases involving an individual employed at DAT’s headquarters during the period from May 2019 through August 2024.
It found that not only had the employee made questionable purchases, including questionable CPC payments made on behalf of two senior management employees at SDAT, but that there were problems with the agency’s internal controls “that enabled questionable activity to do undetected.”
The report said that 37 SDAT employees had corporate cards, and they made 7,649 purchases worth $2.3 milion from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. The targeted individual was responsible for 530 payments during that time, totaling $118,000.
The employee submitted 230 payments, worth $41,400, without receipts and another 16, worth $1,400, that came with illegible receipts. When documentation was available, the agency, and later the auditors, found some questionable expenses like $376 paid to one vendor for items that included dog food and steaks; and $190 for items that included “tumblers, nail polish and other personal items.”

	The audit also found that the employee paid about $6,800 for two rental properties in Ocean City in August 2022, apparently at the direction of two management employees attending a conference there from Aug. 17-20. But the report noted that the rentals were for the entire week of Aug. 13-20 and were made in each case for two adults and two children. It said SDAT could not provide justification for the extra nights, or show whether costs of the vacation property were consitent with standard hotel costs for the resort at that time of year.
SDAT said it identified the questionable expenses by the employee while preparing for a 2024 audit by the comptroller’s office, and after identifying $300 in questionable payments — for personal utilities, gas and phone bills — it fired the employee in August 2024. The agency said it stopped its investigation then, since $300 is the threshold for terminating a worker.
But auditors said SDAT could not provide documentation of that investigation, and that when it fired the employee it failed to process it as a “termination with prejudice” — meaning that the employee would have been eligible to be rehired by another state agency.
Auditors said a search of state employment records showed that the person has not been hired by another state agency, and SDAT has since reprocessed the firing to reflect that it was done “with prejudice.”
Even though state law requires that agencies “immediately refer any instances of possible criminal or unethical conduct by an employee” to the attorney general’s office and to the governor’s chief legal counsel, SDAT did not do so, the auditors said. Nor did it seek to recover the questionable payments it uncovered.
In his reply, SDAT Director Bob Yeager agreed with all the findings of the audit and said his agency has taken steps to correct the problems identified in it, including referring the matter to the attorney general and reviewing all agency termination notices to make sure they were properly classified.
Yeager also said the agency has developed a training program for corporate card holders and required refreshers for current card holders, improved processes for approving purchases and reviewing purchase logs, and clarified the proper response when issues are found.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_5903-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photos by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle and Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) In the coming days, a food aid program that helps millions of mothers and young children will likely run out of money. States like Indiana must use their own dollars to keep funds flowing to families or let it lapse, a move that could cut benefits for the 157,000 Hoosiers who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.
But the Indiana Department of Health declined to share specifics about how WIC would operate in the state, saying that “funds have been identified to keep WIC operating as normal for the foreseeable future.”
“IDOH continues to monitor the situation, and WIC is operating as normal,” said Greta Sanderson, the chief communications officer for the agency.
But advocates warn of the potential impacts to Hoosier mothers — including those who are pregnant — and children relying on government services like WIC if such funds ran out.

“It’s providing nutrition to a population where nutrition is critical for development,” said Emily Weikert Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. “… no matter what, our member food banks will continue to be there for communities and for our neighbors who are in need of food assistance.”
Bryant said other food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, appeared to have steady funding in the coming weeks alongside WIC. However, SNAP is reportedly also running out of money even as the Trump administration explores using tariff revenue to fund WIC. 
In a preliminary estimate on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, 156,752 Hoosiers received benefits from WIC in May 2025, the latest data available. Of those, more than half — 87,000, or 56% — were children while infants and mothers each made up 22% of Indiana’s total, or roughly 35,000. 
Between October 1, 2024 — the beginning of the federal fiscal year — and May, the federal government allotted nearly $80 million to Indiana’s WIC program, $24 million of which went to administrative costs. 
Some states are reportedly chipping in their own funds to keep the program running, including Mississippi, Colorado and Connecticut. Other states, like Washington, say they don’t have money available.
The program is one of thousands funded by the federal government, which has had its funding frozen since Oct. 1. Most government offices continue to function as normal during the partisan budget standoff, but cracks are beginning to show — and Hoosiers will be dealing with the consequences. 
Already, a key federal jobs report was delayed and fewer staff are at the state’s only federal park in northern Indiana, though it remains open through the shutdown.
 Other programs impacted by the shutdown

Indiana is slightly more dependent on federal funding than the average state, with 40% of the state’s budget coming from Washington, D.C. compared to 36% for all 50 states, according to Pew. The nonprofit notes that federal programs have rolling deadlines for funding to expire, meaning that some programs don’t need additional appropriations for a few more years.
Gov. Mike Braun’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Molly Craft spoke generally about the federal shutdown’s impact on state services last week: “We are in good shape.”
“Let’s see how long this goes. We have smart people leading different agencies — we’ll work out with them the details to try to make sure Hoosiers are served well, despite whatever may happen in D.C.,” she said.
Indiana education officials said the immediate effects of a federal government shutdown on K-12 schools will likely be limited — at least at first.
Courtney Bearsch, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Education, said the department “is continuing the normal operations of programs funded by federal grants,” given that a majority of IDOE’s federal funding is already authorized for the 2025-2026 school year. 
“If the shutdown lasts for an extended period,” Bearsch added, “IDOE will re-evaluate the situation, along with our state-level partners.”
Because most federal grants to schools were awarded over the summer, the U.S. Department of Education expects minimal disruption to day-to-day district operations. 
Federal officials said Title I funds, which support schools with higher concentrations of students in poverty, and funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act will continue to flow. But the agency will halt new grantmaking, pause its advisory and regulatory activities, and stop investigations into alleged civil rights violations during the shutdown.
The federal education department will also continue processing Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms, which colleges and universities rely on to assemble financial aid packages.
Still, the pause in government services could be felt sooner in certain Indiana districts that rely on Impact Aid — a federal program that supports school systems on or near federal lands, such as military installations, which can’t be taxed locally. Those payments are made directly to schools, not through the state, and typically arrive later in the calendar year. 
Bearsch said IDOE is not notified when schools receive Impact Aid payments, but noted that last year’s funding went out in December.
The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools warned on Friday that “districts are facing an immediate and significant cash-flow crisis” if payments are delayed.
Six Indiana school districts received Impact Aid in fiscal year 2025, totaling more than $900,000, according to NAFIS.
Those included: Bartholomew Consolidated School Corp., $261,886; Bloomfield School District, $23,669; Loogootee School Corporation, $303452; Madison Consolidated Schools, $81,796; Perry Central Community School Corp., $167,208; and South Ripley Community School Corp., $76,487. 
It’s not clear how much funding districts are expecting for the current fiscal year.
 Federal employees

But, as Pew notes, shutdowns also halt government services such as rulemaking, grantmaking and technical assistance — impacting the employees tasked with reviewing Medicaid waivers, transportation planning and environmental grants.
At least 600,000 federal employees could be suspended, depending on each agency’s definition of who qualifies as essential. Indiana has roughly 25,000 federal employees within its borders.

Many employees are expected to work without pay, including the country’s troops, immigration agents and air traffic controllers. Friday’s paycheck — which covers the pay period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 7 — was the first partial payment since the shutdown began.
And the Trump administration started permanent layoffs on Friday, including:

Commerce: 315 employees
Education: 466 employees
Energy: 187 employees
Health and Human Services: between 1,100 and 1,200 employees
Housing and Urban Development: 442 employees
Homeland Security: 176 employees
Treasury: 1,446 employees

Staffing issues at several airports have caused delays nationwide, from California’s Hollywood Burbank Airport to Newark, New Jersey. Some airports with zero flight controllers for several hours cancelled flights.
Though the Indianapolis airport hasn’t yet had a delay reported to the National Airspace System due to its staff, any change in any part of the greater system has a ripple effect. 
In past shutdowns, employees who are furloughed were guaranteed backpay — but a draft White House memo shared with Axios floats the possibility that the Trump administration may reverse that precedent. 
Bryant, with Feeding Indiana’s Hungry, pointed to increasing levels of food insecurity, saying that the greater Feeding America network — whose donation page explicitly mentions supporting families during the shutdown — anticipates increased demand in the coming weeks.
“This shutdown creates uncertainty for millions of civilian and military federal employees and employees of federal contractors,” said Bryant. “All of whom are at risk of paycheck disruptions and maybe not getting back pay.
“Many of these hard-working folks are just one paycheck away from needing support from their local food bank or pantry.”
Families in need can download the Community Compass app to locate food resources, including free groceries or meals, stores participating in SNAP, WIC clinics and more.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-10-13 11:14:34+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Columbus is now an Italian American myth. Let’s name the day after someone else.,Jen A. Miller,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/13/rename-columbus-day/,Writer Jen A. Miller says she's proud of her Italian American heritage — but thinks Columbus Day in name has to go.,"Writer Jen A. Miller says Italian Americans can celebrate their heritage without honoring Christopher Columbus. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)While living in Italy this summer, I made a trip to Genoa to see Christopher Columbus’s birthplace. It’s a small building, and wasn’t very crowded. The guide spent more time describing a structure in the courtyard, which to him held more historical significance than the house itself. 
This might surprise Americans, given the brouhaha about Columbus Day here. But like pasta primavera and the Feast of the Seven Fishes, Columbus Day is largely an Italian American invention. We should rename the holiday to reflect that it’s about us, and not some long-dead guy whose “discovery” led to the deaths of millions.
Yes, of course, Italians recognize that Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1492. In Italy, it’s called Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo, but it’s not a national holiday and certainly doesn’t carry the same pomp and circumstance as the dozens of saint-dedicated feast days celebrated at different levels of intensity, depending on where you are in the country.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

Columbus Day celebrations started here in 1792, and were pushed as a way to combat then-intense anti-Italian and anti-Catholic sentiments. Most of this work was done at the state level until 1891, when 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in New Orleans. In 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s first voyage, President Benjamin Harris made Columbus Day a one-time, national thing. 
The big movement to make it a national holiday came in 1934 at the behest of the Knights of Columbus, which led to a proclamation by Franklin D. Roosevelt — but not a national holiday (this was the same president who oversaw the internment of nearly 2,000 Italians during World War II). The federal holiday designation came in 1971, set for the second Monday in October.
By this time, Columbus Day was less about a man whose four voyages to the Americas led to the genocide of indigenous peoples and the creation of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and more about a mythologized figure who served as a backdrop for recognizing the accomplishments and contributions Italian immigrants have made to this country. 
The current pro-Columbus Day push is part of a larger backlash against any gains made since 2020 by people who are not straight, white Christian males. In April, President Trump said that Columbus Day needs to make a “major comeback” despite it never going away, and last week signed a proclamation to reclaim the explorer’s legacy. Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli has pledged to “save” Columbus Day — which, again, hasn’t disappeared in a cloud of rainbow-colored woke smoke. 
This summer, the “Columbus Heritage Coalition,” a group who says its mission is to support the celebration of Columbus Day and has a map on its website targeting communities that have renamed the holiday, used an old tweet by New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani opposing the presence of a Columbus statue to try to hurt his election chances by saying he’s “exclusionary” for wanting to take it down.
Mamdani is Muslim and was born in Uganda, so it’s not a surprise that he’d become a target of people using Columbus as a conduit to point at someone else and scream they are now the “other.” It’s part of a long tradition of those who were once persecuted becoming the aggressor. 
It’s not like I’m not proud to be Italian. I’ve been learning the language for more than three years, and on this past summer trip, I rented a Fiat 500 and drove up a steep mountain on tiny, twisty roads to meet the branch of my Italian family who still live there. I didn’t do these things for my health. I did so because where I come from is important to me.
But Columbus Day in name has to go. If we want to keep the holiday but rename it after someone with questionable values, that’s fine. Pick an actual Italian American. Let’s rename the second Monday in October Frank Sinatra Day. At least he won an Oscar.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: The race for NJ governor]A déjà vu campaign in South Jersey is shaping up to be one of the most contested and closely watched Statehouse races this year, with four candidates who sought Assembly seats in 2023 in the 8th Legislative District facing off again.
Democrat Andrea Katz pulled off a surprise upset two years ago when she ousted Republican incumbent Brandon Umba. Now, Umba is back on the campaign trail in an effort to retake the seat. Katz’s 2023 running mate, Anthony Angelozzi, is running alongside her again, while incumbent Assemblyman Michael Torrissi Jr. is Umba’s running mate once more.
Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship at Rowan University, called the race a true toss-up and “a wonderful expression of democracy.”
“You have qualified candidates running against each other with different visions out there, trying to engage as many voters as they can. Yay. Kudos to America, because that’s what it should be,” Dworkin said. “You have other places where as long as you win the primary, you can go to sleep and just wake up after Election Day and you’ve won. This is not one of those districts. This is a very tough district.”
While incumbents typically win and name recognition boosts a candidate’s odds, all four candidates in this race have the advantage of name recognition, while three of the four have Assembly experience, Dworkin noted. This is one of only two districts statewide represented in the Assembly by one Republican and one Democrat.

The 2023 race was so close on election night — with less than 500 votes between Torrissi, the top vote-getter, and Umba, in last place — that Katz appeared to concede the next day. It took a week before election officials instead confirmed her as a winner, after all vote-by-mail and provisional ballots were counted.
Dworkin predicts this year’s race will boil down to who knocks on the most doors and engages the most voters face-to-face in this sprawling district — among the largest statewide by area — that covers parts of Burlington and Atlantic counties.
“I think it’s going to turn significantly on individual relationships: How many voters have met these candidates, shaken their hand, had them knock on their doors, made a personal call, not just from campaign staff, but from the candidates themselves?” Dworkin said.
All four candidates said such personal interactions have been their chief campaign strategy.
Angelozzi said he’s knocked on 6,300 doors and aims to hit 8,000 to 9,000 by Election Day on Nov. 4. Katz said she’s been similarly busy.
“My knees are aching. I’m exhausted. There’s muscles in my legs that I didn’t know existed,” Katz said. “But that’s how we do it. We just talk to people, and then we trust that the voters are going to do what’s best for them.”
A battle against colon cancer kept Torrissi largely sidelined during the 2023 campaign, but this year is different, he said.
“I am completely healthy now. I’ve never been working so hard,” he said.
All 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year.
 Affordability and utilities

All four candidates say affordability is their top issue.

Torrissi, who owns a trucking company, pointed to New Jersey’s highest-in-the-nation property taxes, crippling health care costs, and skyrocketing utility bills as complaints he has heard from voters.
“Everybody seems to be wanting to leave New Jersey,” Torrissi said. “I don’t want to have to leave New Jersey. I want to stay here. And it really comes down to affordability.”
Immigration and supporting police also are top concerns for Torrissi, who said he does not support the sanctuary policies of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. He said his parents were Italian immigrants and that he’s a “pro-immigrant person.”
“I represent everybody. But we want to make sure they’re here legally, and we don’t have criminals,” Torrissi said. “Do it the right way.”
Umba, who is township administrator in Southampton Township, said he wants to fix the school funding formula and make the state “energy independent” by expanding natural gas and renewable energy sources rather than relying on out-of-state energy sources.
“That’s what’s driving up costs,” Umba said.
Angelozzi teaches 10th grade history at Hammonton High School, heads the Hammonton Education Association, and works as a contract negotiator and union organizer for the New Jersey Education Association. He said New Jersey residents are “desperate for relief.”
“Voters want answers. They don’t know why the bills are going up. I feel it myself. My wife and I are schoolteachers. We don’t get paid in the summer. So when those monster electric bills come to our house, it is a stressor,” Angelozzi said.
Angelozzi and Katz, a stay-at-home mother of three and former president of the Chesterfield Democrats, also list as priorities education, school funding, reproductive rights, and “results-oriented” policymaking instead of the bitter partisanship and division that now dominate politics.
“People just want us to go to work and make their lives better. They want the simple things in life. They see the chaos in government, and what I hear is: ‘Can you go and be my voice and be a sane person in government for me?’ Yes, yes I can,” Katz said.

 Turnout key

The district has shifted slightly to the right since its Assembly seats were last on the ballot, with the GOP picking up about 2,000 voters and the Democrats losing about 25 since 2023.

Torrissi and Umba hope the change will help them secure a win. Angelozzi remains undaunted. He pointed out that Katz toppled Umba in 2023 even though Republicans have largely dominated legislative races in this district. Unaffiliated voters also outnumber those registered to either major party in the district, with almost 64,630 unaffiliated voters in June compared to nearly 58,300 registered Republicans and 57,500 registered Democrats, state data shows.
Turnout is typically low in off-year elections, with just 27% of New Jersey voters casting ballots in 2023, compared to 65% in 2024’s presidential election, state data shows. But the governor’s race could juice turnout next month if the 2021 gubernatorial race is any indication — 40% of registered voters cast ballots in that election, data shows.
Voters now have three ways to vote — in person on Election Day, in person at early voting locations beginning Oct. 25, and by mail, which is already underway, Dworkin noted.
“Right now, on both sides in this campaign, they are chasing down ballots,” Dworkin said. “But I can’t tell you who’s going to win this thing.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Schneider: Vaccines are value — echoes from the past.","This commentary is by David Schneider, DO, MS-HCT, FAAP, of Rutland. Schneider is a board-certified Vermont pediatrician with a master’s degree in health care transformation. 
I am likely correct that no person reading this has seen smallpox.
It has been nearly 90 years since the last isolated report of a Vermonter ill with this dreaded, disfiguring, often life-stealing disease.
After the 1928 Vermont epidemic, spurred by lax vaccination, the Vermont Department of Health instituted a highly successful immunization campaign. 1929 ended with a near-eradication of smallpox in our state.
Most Americans in the 1920s received plenty of exercise and sleep. Alcohol was prohibited. Meals were whole food, fresh and devoid of microplastics — yet life expectancy averaged around 50 years. Illness and death from smallpox, influenza, pneumonias, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, strep and other infectious diseases were common. Today, many of these infections are prevented or mitigated due to medical advances, foremost immunizations. However, many pathogens are on opportunistic standby.

On May 14, 1796, Dr. Edward Jenner successfully administered his new smallpox vaccine. The vaccine arrived in the U.S. in 1800. Despite concerns at the time that people would turn into cows, vaccine delivery increased and smallpox outbreaks decreased. By 1949, smallpox no longer existed on American soil.
To reiterate: There has been zero, zilch, nada, none, no smallpox in the U.S. since 1949 and was declared eradicated from the planet in 1980. The nearly 100% effective vaccine had saved countless lives.
Vermonters on the whole embrace immunization. While there has been a recent decline in immunization rates, we are not yet seeing an impact on public health. There is a fine line, however. For example, the established goal for community protection against measles is a 95% immunization rate. Vermont is presently at about 94%. Measles is so contagious that only a few percentage points below the 95% immunization goal sacrifices our protections.
Families share that they are struggling, attempting to discern accurate information from a recent deluge of misinformation, disinformation and flagrant malinformation about vaccines. Health care professionals take our responsibilities to heart and will not be dispirited by the recent environment of fabricated anti-vaccination propaganda. On the contrary, we are more dedicated than ever to empathetically maintain our trusting relationships with patients as we help address immunization questions.
In a conversation with Merideth Plumpton, the Immunization Program Manager with the Vermont Department of Health, she spoke about her concern for families that are at loss when it comes to finding accurate vaccine information. Still, she reminds me that it’s amazing to live in a state that follows science. We have a history of health commissioners who always put science first; we have a governor who is willing to say that vaccines “are the best way to prevent serious illness.”
Dr. Anna McCloy, a Rutland pediatrician, shares, “What I love is when patients are honest about their biggest vaccine fears. I can work with them.” She has noticed a misguided trend: the belief that “whole foods, healthy habits and loving our kids will protect them.” History demonstrates that these behaviors are important, but they are incomplete when it comes to infectious pathogens. Immunizations are an important part of healthy living.
Immunization recommendations and schedules will change from time to time. As with all vaccines, recommendations to administer or to discontinue immunization are based upon epidemiology and scientific evidence measuring the benefits of vaccination against any potential risks. This is the standard that has successfully held true. Independent, apolitical, trained, experienced, logical, methodical scientific review and expertise assessing vaccine benefits relative to any potential risk must always dictate recommendations.
There is no conspiracy. There are no big-dollar incentives. There is no deep-state attempt to control and manipulate genes. There is no activation of autism. There is no human-to-cow metamorphosis. Immunizations are a gift of successful medical achievements contributing to a healthy life, family and community. Immunizations are health care of value.
Please immunize. Save lives.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The number of Minnesota parents claiming non-medical exemptions to routine vaccinations has more than doubled in recent years, likely fueling the recent emergence of new measles cases, including two last week.
Minnesota has reported 20 measles cases this year, with all recent cases in unvaccinated people.
Measles is a highly contagious illness that, before the 1960s, nearly all children contracted and from which tens of thousands were hospitalized every year. Thanks to decades of widespread vaccination, it was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, though the number of measles cases in 2025 — the highest in three decades — is now threatening that status.
That’s partly because more families are getting their kids out of routine vaccinations, including for measles.


“What’s happening in Minnesota is happening across the country,” said Department of Health  Commissioner Brooke Cunningham after Gov. Tim Walz got vaccinated for the flu and COVID on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, trends have gone down over the last five years. But we want to see them come back up.”
Nationwide, 3.6% of kindergartners are exempt from one or more vaccines, compared to 2.2% a decade ago. In Minnesota, nearly 6% of kindergartners are receiving vaccine exemptions, reflecting growing vaccine skepticism that has found a champion in the highest reaches of the nation’s health infrastructure. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, has encouraged the measles vaccine but stops short of supporting a mandate for it.


“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” Kennedy Jr. wrote on X in April, following a visit to families of children who died in the Texas measles outbreak. He’s also previously said that he’d vaccinate his own child for measles “probably.”
In 2024, 86% of Minnesotan kindergartners got two doses of the MMR vaccine, which includes the measles vaccine — far below the 95% of vaccine coverage threshold below which the highly contagious disease can easily spread in communities.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2202122299-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Trump administration cuts to government programs and downsizing of the civil service workforce have altered the public sector substantially. This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.
The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.
Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age. 
Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy. 
International comparison
Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.  
Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties. 
While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.   
Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts. 
Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government. 
Leveraging the non-for-profit arena
When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover. 
The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.
It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.
Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.

Tim Walz receives the flu and COVID-19 vaccination, Oct. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the Office of Gov. Walz)Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, received COVID and flu vaccines last week, and the CDC released new guidance that anyone over 6 months can receive the COVID-19 shot after consulting with a pharmacist or health care provider.
“Our message today is simple: Minnesotans will continue to have the freedom to receive their vaccines,” Walz said.
New guidance last week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the COVID shot has cleared up weeks of confusion on who can receive the vaccine, following restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration in August.
The CDC now says that the vaccine can be administered to anyone over 6 months after consultation with a health care provider. The recommendation is a “shared clinical decision-making” guideline — a step down from “routine” recommendations for vaccines — which emphasizes vaccination as an option instead of outright encouraging it, wrote Jason L. Schwartz in a Yale School of Public Health publication.
The Minnesota Department of Health already released a standing order — following an executive order from Walz — to ensure that Minnesotans 3 years old and up can get a COVID shot regardless of federal recommendations.
In other words, Minnesotans’ right to receive the COVID vaccine is protected on both the state and federal level now.


As for whether your insurance will cover the shot, the new CDC guideline is still considered an official recommendation, and most insurance plans’ coverage is linked to CDC recommendations. As such, the COVID vaccine will be covered “through all payment mechanisms,” according to a CDC release last week.
AHIP, the trade group representing health insurers, said in a September statement in advance of the CDC recommendation that their member insurance companies would continue covering COVID and flu shots for free until the end of 2026.
MDH said in a statement that that the vaccine will be covered by insurance “in most cases.”
“I would love for our insurance plans to come out and be very clear with their members about the coverage for our COVID vaccines,” said MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham. Minnesota does not require state-regulated insurers to cover the COVID vaccine, unlike in 13 states, according to health policy research organization KFF.

This could mean reduced benefits or increased payments by the employers and employees who fund the program, which lets Washingtonians take paid time off work for serious health issues or to care for a family member or a new child. 
The program’s actuary says paid family and medical leave could face a more than $350 million deficit in 2029. 
The state sets a premium rate annually for how much employers and employees need to pay into the program. This year, 0.92% of Washington workers’ paychecks go toward it. Next year, that’s projected to increase to 1.13%, though the rate will be finalized at the end of this month.
The problem is that state law caps premiums for the paid leave program at 1.2%. The state is projected to reach that cap in 2027 and stay there. That plateau means the program likely won’t be able to keep up with rising claims for benefits and increased payments as wages grow.
The program has been steadily growing since its launch in 2020. From July 1, 2024, to June 30, over 320,000 applications were submitted for paid leave, up 15% from the previous year, according to a report this month. Over 240,000 Washingtonians received more than $2 billion in total benefits, a year-over-year increase of about $300 million.
And legislation approved this year extending job protections for those who use this paid leave is likely to encourage even more people to use it.
“This plan is too popular not to be better funded,” said Sen. Steve Conway, D-Tacoma. 
The program already has periodic deficits as it falls behind in paying out claims before receiving premium payments each quarter. But the problem a few years down the road would be a sustained deficit, resulting in not enough money to dole out benefits, without legislators backfilling funding. 
In 2023, faced with a program already more popular than expected, lawmakers infused $200 million from the general fund into the paid leave account. The money provided a cushion and allowed the state to temporarily lower its premium rate.
Another funding boost like this is unlikely anytime soon as the state grapples with deep budget challenges.
Officials are also frustrated about how the rate for premiums has to be set each year under state law. The current formula looks backward, using the past as its main baseline for calculating future needs. Late last year, an audit found this contributed to the program’s potential long-term insolvency.
The Employment Security Department prefers an “actuarial approach” that is more forward-looking. States with similar initiatives take this approach to setting tax rates, and this is akin to how contributions are calculated for Washington’s workers’ compensation system. Last year’s audit recommended shifting to this method. 
A bill in the Legislature looked to make this change this year. Senate Bill 5292, spearheaded by Conway, passed the state Senate nearly unanimously before stalling in the House.
Changing the approach to calculating premiums wouldn’t secure the program’s financial future. The 1.2% cap on premiums would remain.
After Conway’s bill passed the Senate, lawmakers in the state House tried to shoehorn in an increase to the premium rate to 2% by 2033 in an attempt to address the looming deficit. The legislation died in the House, likely due to that change, Conway said. But the measure can be revived in the next legislative session, beginning in January.
Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, opposes raising the cap on premiums. It’s asking a lot of workers while the state is also now taxing wages to fund Washington’s long-term care program, which started collections in 2023, said King, the top Republican on the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee. He added that this affects lower-income workers more. 
He instead would like to see the conversation focus on cutting back the number of weeks of paid leave people are eligible for, or restricting the events that qualify for eligibility. 
“We got to start looking at, well, just how generous is this program?” King said. “How much of this can we afford to do, and how much are people really willing to pay into a program that a lot of them will never use?”
Another idea floated has been raising what is called the “taxable wage base,” Conway said. Workers only pay taxes to support the program on earnings up to this amount, currently $176,100.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/baby-hand-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

MOScholars, which provides private school vouchers, expanded this fall with an infusion of state funds (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)State funding of private-school vouchers is primarily being used for students attending religious institutions, with nearly 98% of funding going toward Catholic, Christian, Jewish and Islamic schools.
This year, state lawmakers passed a budget that included a request from Gov. Mike Kehoe to supply the state-run K-12 scholarship program, MOScholars, with $50 million of general revenue. Previously, the impact to the state’s bottom line was indirect, with 100% tax-deductible donations fueling the program.
Donations are still part of MOScholars’ funding, but the state appropriation has more than doubled the number of scholarships available.
During the 2024-25 school year, MOScholars awarded $15.2 million in scholarships.
In August alone, the State Treasurer’s Office received invoices for scholarships totaling $15.6 million, according to documents obtained by The Independent under Missouri’s open records laws.
The invoice process is unique to the direct state funding of the program. The nonprofits that administer scholarships, called educational assistance organizations, were the sole keepers of scholarship funds. But now, the State Treasurer’s Office holds scholarship money derived from general revenue in an account previously only used for program marketing and administration.
The invoices contained data on which schools MOScholars students are attending and the scholarship amount.
Of the 2,329 scholarships awarded in August, only 59 went to students in nonreligious schools.
 

 
This number did not surprise Democratic lawmakers, who for years have warned that state revenue was going to be siphoned into religious schools.
“We are simply subsidizing, with tax dollars, parents who would already choose to send their kids to a private school,” state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, told The Independent. “And now we are using public dollars to pay for schools that are not transparent whatsoever in choosing who to educate and who not.”
Some schools have been criticized for admission requirements that push a moral standard.
Christian Fellowship School in Columbia, which received scholarships for 63 MOScholars students in August, requires “at least one parent of enrolled students professes faith in Christ and agrees with the admission policies and the philosophy and doctrinal statements of the school,” according to its handbook. 
These statements include disapproval of homosexuality.
“The school reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student,” the handbook continues.
With around 430 K-12 students enrolled at Christian Fellowship School, according to National Center for Educational Statistics survey data, MOScholars makes up a sizable portion of its funding. But it is not the only school with a large number of scholarship recipients.
Torah Prep School in St. Louis had 229 K-12 students during the 2023-24 school year. And in August, 197 MOScholars students received funding to attend the school. Torah Prep did not respond to a request for comment.
The high number of students attending religious schools with MOScholars funding is somewhat incidental, somewhat by design.
The MOScholars program allows its six educational assistance organizations to choose what scholarships they are willing to support. 
Religious organizations stepped into the role to help connect congregants with affiliated schools. Only two of the six educational assistance organizations partner with schools unaffiliated with religion.
The Catholic dioceses of Kansas City-St. Joseph and Springfield-Cape Girardeau run the educational assistance organization Bright Futures Fund, which administered nearly half of the scholarships awarded in August.
The educational assistance organization Agudath Israel of Missouri focuses on Jewish education, partnering with four Jewish day schools.
The organization’s director Hillel Anton told The Independent that students are attracted to the program for more than just religious reasons.
“(Parents’) first and foremost concern is where their child is going to be able to be in the best learning environment,” Anton said. “And you may have a faith-based school that is fantastic and is able to provide that.”
 

 
The demand for the program has long exceeded funding availability. Going into August, organizations had waitlists of students eligible for a scholarship but without funding secured.
Agudath Israel of Missouri couldn’t guarantee scholarships for all of the returning students, Anton said, until the state funding was official.
“Because a lot of the funding is done towards the end of the year… we had everyone on a wait list,” he said. “Because we didn’t know necessarily how much funding we were going to have, we weren’t awarding anyone (the funding).”
Because the program was previously powered by 100% tax-deductible donations, the majority of funds poured in around December. But families need the money months sooner, with tuition due at the start of the school year.
Some educational assistance organizations prefunded scholarships, dipping into their savings to front expenses in the fall. Others had schools that would accept students and wait for payment.
The funding from the state, though, has resolved the backlog and allowed organizations to give scholarships to everyone on their wait list.
“Everyone who qualified for a scholarship this year received one,” Ashlie Hand, Bright Futures Fund’s director of communications, told The Independent.
Bright Futures Fund nearly doubled the number of students it serves, from 1,050 to 1,909.
Agudath Israel of Missouri is growing, too. The new funding helped the organization expand from 175 scholarships last year to 277 this year.
Some expect the state funding to continue next year to support this year’s windfall of scholarships. State Treasurer Vivek Malek told The Independent in May that if donations fall short, he will request state funds to support the new students through graduation.

As we near the holiday season, you may be looking to treat yourself to those set of wheels you’ve been eyeing, or perhaps it’s time to purchase your loved one their dream car. In today’s financial climate, managing your vehicle costs efficiently is key, as it could help you save money and limit potential headaches down the road. Here are some helpful tips to finally make that purchase for your (or a loved one’s) dream vehicle this holiday season:

Set your holiday budget, and stick to it. There are a variety of different expenses that come with getting a car – the purchase cost, insurance, maintenance and fuel being a few of them. Knowing how much you can afford, especially if you plan to pay for it over time, is key to avoiding a car bill that stretches your finances. Look for access to different budgeting tools and tips that can help you save for your purchase.
Look for the best holiday deals. Like many other items, vehicles have a price cycle; the end of the year tends to be when you can find a better deal, as dealers may need to meet quotas or clear out inventory. Generally, make sure you are considering multiple vehicles and shopping around at several dealerships to get the best price. 
Test drive the vehicle to make sure it fits your needs. This is your time to see how the vehicle looks and feels, try out the interior systems and figure out if the vehicle fits your needs. Schedule test drive appointments to ensure the car you want is still available, ideally a few in the same day or week to keep your impressions fresh in your mind. It’s also helpful to simulate your daily driving conditions as much as possible, such as bringing any car seats or equipment you may have in your car daily. After your test drive, you can ask about the car’s warranty and fuel and maintenance requirements, as well as the possibility of getting an extended test drive or bringing the car to your own mechanic for a second opinion.
Determine whether you are financing or leasing. There are benefits of both a lease and a loan. With a loan, there is no milage limit and you are free to customize and change the car as you see fit. After completing your finance payments, you own it. Leases typically have lower upfront costs than loan payments, and at the end of the term you can return, purchase or trade the vehicle in. But keep in mind that most leases have a mileage limit, so it might not be the best option if you travel often.  
How to know if an electric vehicle is right for you. With so many major manufacturers building EVs, there are more options than ever before. However, cost, maintenance, range and charging logistics are all key factors to consider. For maintenance, EVs typically require less maintenance than traditional cars. EV batteries tend to be covered by 8-10 year warranties (outlasting the amount of time most people own their cars) but EV tires degrade faster due to the weight of the battery.  And just as gas prices vary, so do electricity costs – based on your location, your driving style and the size of your battery.

The median range of an EV with a fully charged battery is roughly 250 miles, but that number depends on the make and model as well as other factors like weather, traffic conditions and driving style. And when it comes to charging infrastructure, some cities and states may have more charging stations than others. Make sure to plan your trip ahead of time and map your route.  
Be sure to do your homework first before making that big purchase. There are many tools available that can help you plan for costs in addition to the vehicle loan or lease payments, such as sales taxes, registration fees, and insurance—which can vary depending on the car make, model and even the color. For instance, using a car payment calculator can help estimate your monthly car payment for different scenarios, by inputting the ballpark amount you’d like to finance along with some other basic info.

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).No, I do not want to go collect signatures. 
My friend asks. I rack my brain for excuses. Walking up to strangers does not come naturally to me. My kids must have a soccer game or birthday party or something that conflicts. 
They do not. I have no excuse. I go. 
Once I get out there, I‘m glad I did. I meet lots of people just as angry as I am about the gerrymander of Kansas City and eager to reverse it. People thank me for being there.
I remain extremely resentful that I need to do it. 
I’m collecting signatures to reverse the bill passed in the special session that redraws Missouri’s new maps to deprive Kansas City residents of their voting power, specifically, of their U.S. Representative of 20 years, Emanuel Cleaver.
If our legislators would embrace democracy, play by the rules and represent their constituents, I’d be hanging with my family instead of approaching strangers on the sidewalk with a clipboard.
Trump demanded that red states redistrict mid-decade to increase Republican chances of retaining control of the House. Trump constantly says how popular he is, but if he believed that, he wouldn’t need new maps.
Some Republican governors pushed back against Trump’s demands. 
Not ours. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe took his MAGA marching orders and called the legislature into a special session even though our legislature fought over and redrew our maps only two years ago. Kehoe did this even though Missouri is already extremely gerrymandered, with 40% of Missouri voters identifying as Democrats, but only two out of eight congressional seats represented by Democrats. The gerrymander is intended to make that one out of eight. 
They also passed a bill in the special session to make it impossible for Missourians to use the initiative petition process. 
It is astoundingly anti-democratic that the majority of Missouri legislators have dedicated themselves to thwarting the will of Missouri voters and getting around the Missouri constitution.
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Sure, I’m grateful Missouri has the citizens’ initiative petition so that voters can enact policies with bipartisan support when the legislature refuses to. Yes, I’m grateful for the referendum process that allows voters to reject laws passed by the legislature. 
But it’s a bad way to make law.
We wouldn’t need to use these burdensome, expensive processes if Missouri legislators didn’t treat Missouri voters like an enemy to be defeated.
It’s absurd that we have 40 pages of marijuana regulations in our state constitution. The legislature should have decriminalized marijuana via statute, enacting a policy favored by a majority of Missourians, but leaving legislators with flexibility to amend it as needed. Instead, advocates for policy changes increasingly feel they have to do everything by constitutional amendment because our legislature will immediately overturn any statute enacted by voters.
The paid sick leave ballot initiative, approved by 57% of Missouri voters after advocates gathered thousands of signatures to get it on the ballot, was only a statute. So the legislature trashed that, no problem. 
Even a constitutional amendment isn’t enough. As soon as Missourians decriminalized abortion via Amendment 3, the legislature immediately sought to reverse it. They halted all the legislature’s business at the end of session to put a deliberately misleading measure to re-ban abortion on the 2026 ballot (The amendment to re-ban abortion will also be called Amendment 3, for ultimate voter confusion).
This is not how democracy is supposed to work. Our representatives should represent us. All of us. Even those of us who are Democrats or independents or Republicans who support abortion decriminalization or paid sick leave. Voters are supposed to pick their representatives rather than politicians picking their voters. 
But Missouri Republicans are all in on Trump’s goal of dominating the opposition by whatever means necessary — including unconstitutional means. They are rejecting the fundamental premise of our democratic system that representatives of different populations must negotiate what the laws should be that govern all of us.
I saw Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin on a panel last year. She favorably contrasted the work that women in the legislature were able to do across the aisle to the extremism of some of her fellow Republicans. 
O’Laughlin has since gone all in for extremism. She abandoned any interest she once claimed to have in working for all Missourians when she shepherded the special session bills to deprive Kansas City area Missourians of their representation and gut all Missourians’ constitutional right to the initiative petition.
O’Laughlin, who presides over a Republican supermajority, made a claim about her other colleagues in an attempt to defend the gerrymander that is both laughable and shockingly disingenuous: “The map and the initiative petition reform measures will strike a huge blow to progressives and their efforts to turn Missouri into California.” 
Again, Missouri voters are 40% Democrats, with 25% representation in Congress. O’Laughlin’s allegation that anyone is trying to turn Missouri into California puts her at the goofiness level of the Missouri Freedom Caucus members she once criticized. But somehow she now has no problem lying about her colleagues across the aisle in defense of an unconstitutional bill intended to get Democratic representation down to 12.5%. On Trump’s orders. 
Gov. Kehoe readily abandoned his constitutional obligations when Trump said jump. The Missouri constitution says that redistricting happens every 10 years, after the federal census. Kehoe says, “We’ll let the courts decide that.”
Here’s the thing: Running a state is not supposed to be a game of “what can I get away with?” 
Kehoe swore an oath to uphold the constitution of Missouri. He shouldn’t be signing a mid-decade map openly designed to disenfranchise targeted Missourians. The job of the governor is to work in the interest of Missourians, not to light Missouri tax dollars afire with a special session and the inevitable lawsuits that will follow, to demonstrate fealty to Donald Trump.
The gerrymander is unconstitutional and I don’t expect it can survive court review. However, because I believe there are few things in life more important than living in a functioning democracy, I won’t be taking any chances.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.
The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.
“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.
The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.
Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.
“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”
Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.
“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”
Battery power and rural grid upgrade
The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.
The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.
“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”
The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.
The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”
Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.
The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.
Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.
The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.
Energy efficiency and innovation
Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.
“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.
Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.
Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.
Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.
The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.
If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.
A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.
“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”
Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.  
‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program
A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.
“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”
Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out. 
Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.
“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”
WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.
If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”

The superintendent of Moore Public Schools didn’t think the Oklahoma Legislature made the right choice when implementing a statewide ban on student cellphones in schools this year. He thought parents would be against it and teachers would spend too much time policing the rule.
“I’m all about eating crow when I have to, and they got this one right,” he said.
Now nine weeks into the school year, Romines said “things have gone really, really well.” Discipline incidents have significantly decreased, he said, and students are more engaged with their teachers and each other.  
Students are passing footballs and playing volleyball in high school courtyards during lunch period. Junior high students are playing cards and board games.
“Those are things that we would not have seen last year and in previous years,” he said. “That’s big. I mean, that’s huge. It’s just been a really good thing.”

Senate Bill 139 prohibited student use of personal electronic devices, including cellphones and smart watches, for the entire school day. The law required all public school districts to comply with the full-day ban for the 2025-26 school year. After that, each local school board can decide whether to continue with the policy or try something different.
Romines said he expects Moore to keep the policy next year, though the decision isn’t his to make alone. 
He said it’s been helpful that all public schools in the state are under the same cellphone rule, so “parents can’t come back and say, ‘Well, Norman does it this way. Moore does it this way. Mustang does it this way, Edmond does it this way.’” The lack of comparison has helped with acceptance.
In Bartlesville Public Schools, cellphones had become an incessant nuisance in seventh-grade teacher Heather Davis’ classroom. 
Davis, in her 32nd year of teaching, remembers when old Nokia cellphones first appeared in her students’ hands, but once personal devices started connecting to social media, “that’s when I saw the uptick in kids checking out of school and checking into their cellphones.”
“It was constant lunch detentions, calls home, sent to the office, all of that,” she said. “And I would say that probably it was a problem for about 30% to 40% of my students.”

That changed dramatically this year with the statewide ban in place. So far, Davis said she’s had to discipline only one student for breaking the rule.
Her school had attempted to crack down on cellphones in the past, but this time, students and their parents have been more willing to comply, knowing the policy comes from a state law, she said.
It’s made a noticeable difference in her English language arts classes, she said. More students are participating, asking questions and completing their work.
“My kids are way more engaged,” Davis said. “I have a lot more students who are passing at this point in the class in the school year.”
Another seventh-grade teacher, Melanie Darter, said the cellphone ban has been a “game changer” at John W. Rex Charter Intermediate School in Oklahoma City. 
Students at the school are required to leave their cellphones in their backpacks for the day, said Darter, who teaches science.

“I haven’t seen one yet,” Darter said while speaking at an interim study Tuesday at the state Capitol. “Every once in a while, one will ring in my class, but it’s because it’s in their backpack. And so, I’m like, hey, I don’t even care. It’s away. So, they’re doing really well with that.”
An author of SB 139, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, said she hears from educators and parents multiple times a week about the impact of the cellphone ban — stories of extra books being checked out in school libraries and anecdotes of classmates showing more togetherness.
Given the perceived success of the cellphone ban, Seifried and the law’s House author, Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, are now exploring whether other technology, like Chromebooks, should be limited in schools. They didn’t draw a definitive conclusion during their interim study on the topic Tuesday, but both said they want to continue the conversation. 
In the meantime, Caldwell said feedback has been “really, really positive” with SB 139 in effect.
“Just the stories we’ve heard from our educators about the laughter and the conversation that is filling our hallways and our lunchrooms, I think that’s exciting,” he said. “And you take a look at increased learning opportunities and a decrease in behavioral issues, I mean, that is a true win-win. I think it’s a very simple change, but it’s one that’s really having a profound impact on our kids.”

 Idaho wants to exempt some services for personal agencies, family homes from Medicaid pay cuts

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider reimbursement rates in late August. The move was in response to Gov. Brad Little’s order for mid-year budget cuts across state government to avoid a budget shortfall.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

The Medicaid pay cuts are already in effect, sort of.
The state is paying providers the usual reimbursement rates. But once Idaho gets permission from the federal government, the state can claw back funds for the cuts.
Health and Welfare spokesperson Greg Stahl told the Idaho Capital Sun last week that the agency is asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to let the state exempt services for personal care and certified family homes from the cuts. 
“The requests held harmless personal care services and certified family homes from rate adjustments following the required access analysis and public comment,” Stahl said in an email. “The department will post an information release for providers in the coming weeks with more details.”
 Idaho can’t afford to lose more providers, advocate says

Idaho Association of HomeCare Agency President Lindsey Hendricks said exempting disability care providers from the cuts doesn’t solve their financial issues.
“We’re still so far behind on where we should be with reimbursement rates,” she told the Sun. 
If payments stay on track, about a quarter of Idaho personal care agencies are at risk of closing within the next year, according to a survey by the organization. And if the state’s cuts to Medicaid payments extend to disability care providers, even more agencies anticipate they’d be forced to make tough decisions, like closing their doors, cutting staff pay or services.

In 2023, a report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations estimated Idaho had a shortfall of 3,000 direct care workers. But by 2023, the report projected the shortfall would more than triple — to 9,500 workers. 
Idaho can’t afford to lose any more providers, said Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities Executive Director Christine Pisani. 
“We are well on our way of having a complete void of service providers as a result of not addressing the direct care workforce crisis in Home and Community-Based Services,” she told the Sun. “So, who’s really going to get hit hard are our seniors, people with disabilities and families. And our rural areas have already been left behind. … So anything they do have, I think is going to be lost.” 
Most of the home care providers in the Idaho Health Care Association already don’t take Medicaid — because the program’s reimbursement rate hasn’t kept up with costs, said the group’s Executive Director Robert Vande Merwe.
Exempting them from the cuts, he said, “keeps them at status quo, which is still not enough.”
“We’re urging the Legislature not to cut taxes again, unless they have a plan to stabilize the budget,” Vande Merwe said. 
He thinks the governor may need to cut spending more “just to stay whole from the last year’s tax cuts,” he said. “If they cut taxes again this session, boy, there’s going to be dramatic cuts in services.”

Several relief programs are now available to certain homeowners. Some require an application.
The post What to know about applying for Wyoming’s property tax exemptions appeared first on WyoFile .","The application window is now open for several property tax relief programs in Wyoming, including exemptions for veterans, long-term homeowners and owner-occupied residential properties. 
WyoFile spoke with Dixie Huxtable, Converse County clerk and legislative committee chairperson for the Wyoming County Assessors’ Association, about what homeowners need to know to save on their tax bills. 
Property taxes have been a major focus of the Wyoming Legislature in recent years, and county officials have done everything from mailings and media advertisements to town halls and visits to the local senior citizen center. 
Still, Huxtable said, some homeowners are not aware of what’s available to them. 
“I’d like to think that we’ve done as much as we can to reach everybody but I still get people — I’ve had people since the first of October, come to my counter and say, ‘I’ve never heard of this before. I didn’t know anything about this until my neighbor told me,’” Huxtable said. 
The one cost-savings program in state law that does not require homeowners to fill out an application is a 4% cap on year-to-year property tax increases. 
Technically, Huxtable said, there are two 4% caps — one is applied to the residential structure, another to the associated residential land. But neither require any action on the homeowner’s part. From there, assessors consider exemptions in an order set by state law. 
Exemptions
Homeowners who live in their home for at least eight months of the year are eligible for a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of the property’s fair market value. 
Last tax year, the exemption was automatically applied to all single-family homes in Wyoming. Homeowners must now apply online by Feb. 1, which includes signing an affidavit affirming they occupy the property. Because an estimated 175,000 homeowners will qualify for the program, Huxtable said the assessors worked with the Department of Revenue to develop the website. 
“We tried to come up with an efficient way to do it, and I’m sure it’s going to have some hiccups. It has had some hiccups, but we’re trying to work it out as best we can to meet the law,” Huxtable said. 
She also said she understands the online process may be difficult for some to access on their own. 
“I have parents that are 95 and 89 years old, and they live at home and they pay their own bills. But they don’t understand this. They don’t have a computer,” Huxtable said.
Wyoming’s older homeowners have another tax-saving option with an exemption specifically for residents 65 years of age and older. Those residents — who have also paid property taxes in the state for at least 25 years — may qualify for a 50% exemption. The home must also be their primary residence. 
Homeowners may apply at their local county assessor’s office before May 26. However, homeowners may not receive both the 25% and the 50% exemptions. 
“It’s not cumulative. It’s one or the other,” Huxtable said. 
Lastly, there is an exemption available for veterans. It reduces the assessed valuation by $6,000, and can also be applied to a vehicle. Applications are available at the local county assessor’s office and are due May 26. 
While not an exemption, the state’s property tax refund program may be another option for homeowners. Whether the program is available will depend on whether lawmakers chose to fund it in the upcoming session. Some legislators are interested in taking things in a different direction, including abolishing property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, some homeowners have urged the Legislature to skip further property tax cuts, citing concerns about funding for public services. Property taxes don’t fund the state government, but rather pay for local services including schools, law enforcement, roads, water and sewer systems, parks and libraries. 
In her own community, Huxtable said she’s noticed people becoming more aware of what property taxes pay for. 
“As this progresses, I think people are beginning to understand that it’s going to have an effect on the services that they’ve come to expect,” Huxtable said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Earlier this month, Oklahoma’s state Insurance Department issued a stark warning that should alarm us all.
When federally enhanced tax credits expire at the end of the year, some Oklahomans will see their health insurance premiums increase by over 75%. The state agency additionally warned that the termination of the federal program and stricter eligibility verification checks will likely “result in a significant decrease in enrollment.”
Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready, a Republican, has urged Congress “to take a softer approach to ending” the subsidies and warned that “the impact to Oklahoma hospital systems is yet to be realized.”
That’s because nearly 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the federal marketplace for health insurance. The tax credits, which end unless Congress takes action, provide financial assistance to help Americans afford health insurance through the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. The marketplace serves as a safety net for people who don’t have employer-sponsored plans or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid or Medicare.
Slightly over 10% of the nearly 4 million Oklahomans are already uninsured, higher than the national average of 8%.
Instead of taking Mulready’s suggestion for a “softer approach,” we’re getting the nuclear option of a federal government shutdown.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s Republican congressional representatives won’t publicly even consider a pitch by Democrats to permanently restore those federal health subsidies. 
It makes them seem completely tone-deaf to the plight our state is facing even as they heroically fight for their party’s honor.
To be clear, I blame every elected official in D.C. for the shutdown that began Oct. 1. And, I think Democrats are foolhardy to try to use a shutdown like this to leverage this policy goal even if it is needed.
But I don’t understand why both sides can’t temporarily compromise on Republicans’ plan for a short-term extension that keeps the government open until Nov. 21 to give the GOP time to work out the logistics of continuing this vital program. I also don’t understand why Republicans won’t commit to extending this in exchange for ending this shutdown.
This inability to even consider compromise is making me wonder what we’re paying Congress for when they can’t even do their most basic job — pass a budget that lasts an entire fiscal year.
After all, they’re supposed to represent our needs in D.C. That should mean Oklahomans’ needs trump their political party’s. (No pun intended.)
And right now, 300,000 Oklahomans — and frankly our state’s entire health care system — need extended access to those affordable insurance premiums that Democrats are fighting for. (Americans covered by private employers also need access to affordable premiums, but that’s a whole other issue.)
I understand the reluctance to give Republicans more time, but the stakes are too high here to mess this up.
Still I figured our congressional delegations would be spending their days trying to broker a bipartisan compromise to make sure our state’s federal workers get paid.
Republican Sen. James Lankford, after all, showed an inspiring level of bipartisanship in 2024 when he worked across party lines to help develop a plan to help fix our immigration system. But his party rejected the proposal and hung him out to dry after then-presidential candidate Donald Trump pooh-poohed it, so I can understand his reluctance to stick his neck out here. 
Maybe Lankford should be trying to keep a low profile, though. He apparently had so much time on his hands last week that he was making the rounds on seemingly any television show that would have him. He blamed Democrats trying to appeal to their “far-left base” even as service members risk missing paychecks because of the shutdown.
And then he was even so bold to post this gem on social media about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Sen. Schumer believes this shutdown is a success for the Democrats politically. You’ve got to be kidding me – members of our military are serving our country while not getting paid.”
You know who is getting paid? Lankford and Schumer. 
Congress gets paid even if they’re not working because they’re protected by the U.S. Constitution during government shutdowns even while members of our military, air traffic controllers and hundreds of thousands of American employees go without.
Not to be left out, Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice, asked Schumer on her social media account if he would “like to explain how missing a paycheck makes things better for hard-working Oklahomans?”
I’d be very curious to know how losing federal health insurance subsidies make things better for hard-working Oklahomans, too.
Americans are not paying our delegation to sit on their behinds and play the blame game on TV and social media.
It’s time for them to remember who they represent and take this my-way-or-the-highway mentality and shove it where it belongs. They should serve the voters, not their political parties.

The grant would support BWXT's proposed TRISO plant, while another $10 million would support carbon capture and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County. 
The post Wyoming considers $100M bet on nuclear fuel manufacturing appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s top energy agency is recommending a $100 million grant to support long-time U.S. Navy contractor BWXT Technologies’ TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Gillette, as well as nearly $10 million in grants to continue carbon capture research and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County.
Another potential grant award for $343,000 would support a feasibility study to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network to boost enhanced oil recovery.
The Wyoming Energy Authority announced the potential grant awards this week and will accept public comment before Gov. Mark Gordon makes a final determination about whether to approve each one. The grant programs are directed at energy projects in Wyoming that “are also receiving federal or private funding,” according to the agency.
“Like other [Energy Matching Funds] projects, these projects represent a turning point for Wyoming’s energy future,” Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told WyoFile via email. “Their scale speaks to the seriousness with which our state approaches energy development and diversification, not as a short-term effort, but as a long-term strategy to keep Wyoming strong and energy dominant.” 
Nuclear fuel manufacturing
BWXT proposes to build a $500 million TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. Construction of the “Category II” plant would begin about a year from now, with an in-service target of 2030, according to the Lynchburg, Virginia-based company.

TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of a poppyseed, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. TRISO can withstand higher temperatures than traditional nuclear fuels, and the fuel never leaves the encased pellet, according to the agency.
Importantly, BWXT officials noted, “The facility [in Wyoming] will not produce or store any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel and will not be licensed to do so by the [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission],” the company said in its application to the state.
Separately, BWXT received a $10 million grant from the state in 2023 to study how to tap Wyoming’s existing and potential machining, fabrication and manufacturing facilities to build a supply chain for microreactors. The company inked a tentative agreement last year with trona miner and soda ash producer TATA Chemicals for microreactors to be installed at its facility in southwest Wyoming.
Joshua Parker, BWXT’s senior director of Advanced Nuclear Fuel, recently spoke at a company-sponsored event in Gillette to explain why nuclear energy is receiving renewed interest and to update residents on the company’s dealings in Wyoming.

“We are an energy-starved country,” Parker told a crowd of about 200, adding that the need to support the electricity-hungry artificial intelligence boom is a matter of national security. “Here’s the thing: It takes every energy source. It’s not nuclear, it’s everything. It’s all. We need [natural gas], we need coal … We’re about to have growth in energy that we haven’t seen since coming out of World War II.
“Wyoming,” he continued, “you all have the workforce. You all have the manufacturing. You all have the energy drive. You have uranium here. You have all of those things that make a good energy community.”
BWXT’s pending $100 million grant would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024. If approved, the grant would fully tap the fund’s $100 million appropriation.
The Energy Authority kicked off a 45-day public comment period regarding the grant recommendation, closing on Nov. 25. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.
Coal and carbon dioxide grants
The Wyoming Energy Authority is also considering recommending nearly $10 million from another grant program — Energy Matching Funds — to help support three other energy projects in the state.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative is asking for $4 million for an engineering and feasibility study to analyze whether to build a second coal-fueled unit at its Dry Fork Station power plant north of Gillette. The “Dry Fork Station Unit 2” study, a partnership between Basin Electric and engineering firm Sargent and Lundy, includes evaluating “boiler technologies, air quality control systems and air quality compliance,” according to an application submitted to the agency.

“Moreover, the study will provide a comprehensive comparison of coal generation alongside alternative energy sources, allowing Basin Electric to align its resource planning with current energy market trends and regulatory standards,” the company said.
The 400-plus megawatt-capacity Dry Fork Station was completed in 2011 and gets its coal from the associated Dry Fork mine. It was designed to incorporate carbon capture research.
“Recently many states have talked about their aspirations of building a new coal plant, Wyoming included,” the Energy Authority’s Creager said. “This is the first of many steps towards building America’s next coal plant in Wyoming that will use millions of tons of Powder River Basin coal annually.”
A second Energy Matching Funds grant for $5.5 million would go to the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources to advance its work tied to coal-carbon capture technology at the Integrated Test Center, which is mostly housed at the same Dry Fork Station complex.
“The project aims to expand the [Integrated Test Center’s] capabilities by accommodating a wider range of carbon management technologies,” according to the application. “The facility upgrades and operating plan will help ensure continued [Test Center] operations beyond 2026, attract diverse research tenants and strengthen Gillette’s role as a national hub for carbon management innovation and workforce development.”
The Energy Matching Funds considerations also include Contango’s application for $343,000 to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network in the Big Horn Basin in support of enhanced oil recovery. 
All three proposals are open for public comment, closing on Oct. 18. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.

The post Politics is like dirty dishes appeared first on WyoFile .","No one ever wants to hand-wash the dishes. It’s boring, gross, time-consuming and thankless. It’s even worse when the dishes haven’t been done in weeks. The growing mold, the stack towering ever taller, the mental drain of fighting over who’s fault it is or even just beating yourself up for letting it get this bad. We get overwhelmed, hoping someone else does them. 

Opinion

Politics and the government are that stack of dishes, except instead of piling up for weeks, it’s been decades. The mold and toxicity have reached life-threatening levels. It’s past time for us to do the dishes!
If the government is dishes, life is the food we eat off them. The purpose of dishes is to make it easier and safer to eat. Hot soup is much easier to eat with a bowl and spoon instead of your hands. Government is supposed to play a similar role, making many aspects of life easier for everyone. The government should help meet everyone’s needs and resolve conflicts, just as bowls and spoons make dishing out soup in equal amounts easier.
Everyone eats from the political plates, whether they think so or not. Everyone drinks water, and its acceptable cleanliness levels are determined by the government. Everyone breathes air, and ideally, regulations say corporations can’t expose us to deadly levels of toxins. Everyone also needs health care, yet those who are the least lucky and need help the most end up with unpayable amounts of debt. Either eat your health care soup out of this moldy bowl of insurance, or burn your hand reaching into the pot. 
We argue and bicker about whose turn it is to do the dishes, but someone inevitably points out that we can order pizza and not do the dishes. That benefits the pizza shop, but it’s not a long-term solution.
What does doing the dishes look like? It’s hard work, and commonly boring. It’s going to the city council meeting and talking to your friends about it. It’s getting on the live stream for the Wyoming Legislature’s subcommittees and telling them what you think. It’s voting in primaries. It’s being a political candidate. It’s staying informed and supporting your local, independent news sources. It’s convincing others to help.
This is all too much for one person to do. But just like hand-washing dishes, you don’t actually do it alone. You benefit from the work put into manufacturing the sponges, the research on what makes a good dish soap and the marketing, so you know those products even exist. Those tools are community organizing. It’s way easier if we work together. Just like society, the whole is greater than the parts.
I ask all of you reading to help do the dishes. I don’t want anyone else to die from the bacteria, and the only way to ensure that is to get in there and start scrubbing. The pile may not be our fault, but it is our responsibility. If we all agree to take on one dish, we can get them clean again.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A mother with a 4-week-old baby sent a request for help to the hotline for a grassroots Memphis food pantry focused on serving immigrant families. Her plea reached Jessica Miller, a volunteer and spokesperson for The Collective Good Immigrant Pantry.
“She had been having to feed (the baby) sugar water for two days because she didn’t have any formula and the husband had gotten deported,” Miller said. “So we delivered formula and diapers.”
The pantry — run completely by volunteers out of garages and spare rooms — is ramping up its operations to meet surging needs as federal law enforcement agencies patrol the city as part of the Trump administration’s “Memphis Safe Task Force.”
The Collective Good collects and delivers boxes of food and hygiene essentials to families in need. This can include families in financial distress after a primary provider was detained or deported, or those who are afraid to leave their homes to get groceries.
“There’s so many situations we run into with people … the husband’s been deported, the person that provided for them, right? And then the mom is there with kids that are hungry and they don’t know what to do,” Miller said.
The pantry has also helped immigrant families who have decided to leave the U.S. out of fear, but cannot easily do so because their children are American citizens.
“The children need passports and paperwork,” she said. “It’s not as easy as people think to deport American citizens to another country.”

The pantry, part of the mutual aid arm of progressive organizing group Indivisible Memphis, launched its hotline in July following a string of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in primarily Hispanic neighborhoods, Miller said. A group of concerned advocates saw that “food was going to be a big need” for those who remained. 
From July until the task force’s arrival on Sept. 29, the pantry averaged a little over eight deliveries per week, meeting all requests submitted through the hotline. Last week, the pantry made 22 deliveries. At least 100 requests had poured in as of Oct. 8.
Of the requests received, at least half have come from families with babies in need of formula and diapers.
A local church recently hosted a “baby shower” for the pantry, collecting baby essentials to help the pantry meet growing needs. 
“Politics aside, I don’t know how anybody can look at … babies crying with hunger pain and not think that needs help, or that something’s wrong with that,” Miller said.
Federal task force tallies 562 arrests; exact charges are unclear
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi reported the task force made 562 total arrests and seized 144 illegal guns as of Thursday, before the arrival of National Guard troops on Friday. The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further information about the charges related to those arrests.
Lead organizers for Free the 901, a coalition of Memphis advocacy groups steering response to the federal task force, say they have received hundreds of reports from community members of federal law enforcement agents from multiple agencies working alongside Tennessee Highway Patrol officers to conduct traffic stops throughout the city, particularly in areas with high concentrations of minority residents. 
Tennessee Lookout independently observed several traffic stops on Tuesday evening where agents wearing gear marked as FBI, U.S. Marshalls, Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were present alongside THP officers. 
THP did not respond by the time of publication  to requests for traffic stop data, and it’s unclear how many of the 562 arrests reported by the task force may have resulted from these traffic stops.
Information released to Tennessee Lookout by the Department of Justice on Oct. 7 indicated that roughly 24% of the 386 arrests to that point were done on “administrative ICE warrants.” These warrants are issued by ICE officers to remove non-citizens from the United States, according to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) materials.
Administrative ICE warrants are not criminal warrants, are not signed by a judge or magistrate, and cannot be used to enter private areas such as individuals’ homes. While the “underlying basis for a non-citizen’s removability may be due to some criminal violation,” FLETC Senior Legal Instructor John Seaman stated in a training transcript, an administrative ICE warrant only indicates that an ICE official determined a person is “removable from the United States.”
The arrest data from Oct. 7 also indicated that 63 arrests were for “other” purposes and 125 were for “warrants,” with no additional information on the type of offense. Of the 386 arrests, two were for homicide charges, two were related to probation or parole, 20 were for sex offenses, 30 for narcotics and 50 for firearms-related charges.
Not a typical food bank
Miller describes the Collective Good Immigrant Pantry as a “true mutual aid network operating differently than traditional food banks, which sometimes require paperwork or identification.
The volunteers who started the pantry consulted with leaders in the Latino community to ensure that pantry boxes contain familiar ingredients and spices.
“We did this to fit the Latino community,” she said. “The systems that have failed us aren’t going to be the answer to this, so we decided that we’re going to be the answer for it.”
The pantry collects donations of nonperishable foods and hygiene items through its Amazon wishlist, and accepts cash donations to ensure that each delivery also contains fresh dairy, meat and produce.

Volunteers try to pack the boxes with enough food to feed families for a week. They also include items like coffee and lotion, because “we recognize that even though they’re going through the most traumatic time of their life, they still deserve some happy in their life, too,” Miller said.
Families in need reach out to the pantry’s hotline and provide details on the numbers of adults and children needing food, as well as any allergies. Volunteers then deliver the boxes directly. 
Along with meeting emergent needs, the pantry connects families with longer-term resources offered by other advocacy groups. 
When requests for help shot up, the small group of original pantry volunteers began to get overwhelmed and burnt out, Miller said, but then about 120 people from all over Shelby and surrounding counties answered a call for new volunteers.
“Every week I go into the new week praying that we’ll be able to help more people,” she said. “And sometimes it gets to the point where we’re a little low on funds or low on supplies, but it’s always provided so far.”
Miller said she looks forward to the day when the food bank initiative is not needed, but until that point, her goal is for “our voices to be louder than the ones saying this (federal task force) is what our city needs to make it better.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memphis-Food-Bank002-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

If you’re a longtime follower of North Carolina politics and local news, you might know me from my seven years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WUNC/NC Public Radio, or the blog I wrote there for many years, Isaac Hunter’s Tavern, or from my 14 years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WRAL.
I’ve worked on many fulfilling and award-winning projects over those years, including a series on poverty at WUNC that won a duPont-Columbia Silver Baton for public service. And, of course, I’ve been in the thick of coverage of political contests in the national spotlight, like the 2024 N.C. Supreme court race, the 2024 N.C. gubernatorial race, and our state’s seemingly endless court battles over redistricting, from county courts to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Over that time, I’ve watched Democrats and Republicans rise and fall, from Jim Black and Mike Easley to Robin Hayes and Mark Harris. What I’ve learned is that unchecked power — no matter whose hands it’s in — is never good for the people those officials serve.
That’s why I don’t believe either side has a monopoly on good ideas. I’ve spent the past 21 years explaining to North Carolinians why their state lawmakers have passed certain laws and how those laws and regulations will affect their lives. That will not change now that I’m at NC Newsline. 
We’re here to ask the questions you might ask and tell you how your elected officials did or didn’t answer them.
And when it comes to election coverage, our focus will be on policy instead of the horserace. You can see poll results anywhere. Smart explorations of the issues that matter to you are much harder to come by. That’s what we’re here for. Not to take sides.
We’ll continue to deliver the in-depth coverage for which you’ve come to rely on us. Greg Childress, Lynn Bonner and Clayton Henkel will still bring their years of experience to bear. Ahmed Jallow, Brandon Kingdollar, Christine Zhu and Galen Bacharier will keep bringing their sharp eyes and new perspectives to what we do. Former editor Rob Schofield will continue to provide commentary.
I won’t be writing many columns. I prefer to leave that to those who aren’t involved in daily reporting and editing, although I reserve the right to weigh in on First Amendment and press freedom issues, or course!
I believe an educated electorate is necessary to make democracy work, and what you can learn about your government shouldn’t depend on how much money you make. State policy affects everyone, especially those who are least able to pay to find out about it.
That’s why we’re working hard to expand our reach. There are a lot of small local newspapers and news sites in North Carolina that can’t afford wire services. We want to bring their readers quality coverage of their state government. Donations from readers like you can help us do that.
Thank you for reading. We’ll be here. We hope you will, too.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)TEKAMAH, Neb. — After a months-long dispute, the maintenance of several rural cemeteries in Burt County seems to have reached a resolution, not through the creation of a new board, but a much simpler answer.
Some residents have been pleading with the Tekamah Cemetery District to boost their efforts to maintain three rural cemeteries within the district’s boundaries. Several contend that the board is too focused on maintaining the largest cemetery in the area — Tekamah Cemetery — and let the other cemeteries fall into disrepair.
“When you see the scale of it, it’s so one-sided,” said one resident Lisa Anderson.
Months went by with little to no progress until Anderson proposed at the board’s Sept. 18 meeting that the residents themselves could oversee the maintenance through a separate rural cemetery board. The board agreed to consider this option, and left open the possibility of siphoning off more than $16,000 of its $154,000 budget for the new board.
But at the board’s latest meeting Tuesday, member John Chamberlain said he was unsure that the new board would be legally sound. He later explained that since their board is a bonded agency and the rural board wouldn’t be, that may cause complications.
“There’s a lot of hurdles to jump before we can do this,” Chamberlain said.

The primary need the residents are concerned about is mowing. At the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery, grass and weeds have begun to grow over some of the headstones. Church members claim the cemetery hasn’t been mowed since May, when prior to that the cemetery board had regularly maintained it for decades.
Board members said they had received advice from the Burt County assessor that determined the board shouldn’t continue caring for the cemetery because the land is privately owned by the church, though the cemetery’s defenders argue the cemetery remains public.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the meeting, board members clarified that the board continued to spend money on mowing two of the other rural cemeteries, Arizona and Silver Creek. Crew member Mike Camron said he and his team mow the two cemeteries about once a month.
By comparison, Tekamah Cemetery gets mowed almost daily. One reason: This cemetery is the largest in the county — about 70 acres — so it takes a full week to finish mowing the full property, Camron said.
By the end of the week, grass that was mowed on Monday is in need of mowing again, Camron said. This challenge is part of the reason why care for the rural cemeteries has lagged, Chamberlain said.
Weeds grow over a headstone at the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)
On Tuesday, the board proposed a different solution. Members agreed to increase the mowing of Arizona and Silver Creek cemeteries to twice a month. Additionally, they approved setting aside a maximum of $3,625 to pay for mowing the Seventh Day Adventist cemetery up to eight times before the cemetery board’s next budget cycle begins on June 30. The board tasked residents with finding a mowing contractor who can do the work within the price range.
Chamberlain told the Nebraska Examiner that state statutes offer little clarity on the board’s authority to care for private land that houses a public cemetery. Eventually, he said the board “got tired of fighting” residents on the issue, which led to the proposal.
“We came here tonight to work with you,” Chamberlain told the roughly 20 attendees at the meeting.
At one point, the board considered splitting the cost of mowing the church cemetery 50/50 with the residents, based on the private land vs. public cemetery conflict, Chamberlain said. Ultimately, members decided against that option and agreed to handle the funding.
Meeting attendees appeared pleased with the outcome, especially as one said she had a relative who may be able to mow the church cemetery. One attendee called the resolution a “win-win” for both parties.

An employee to operate this lab and help place students in internships won't be funded following federal grant cuts. (Photo provided by Central Carolina)A tutoring hub, a center to help students land jobs after earning their diploma and an academic advising office to keep students on track to graduate — these are all things Central Carolina Technical College has been able to add to its campus over the past 15 years with the help of federal grant funds awarded to colleges with a large percentage of minority students.
But now that grant program is ending, as the U.S. Department of Education claws back $350 million in funds for schools with large populations of Hispanic, Black, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islander students.
Because of this, Central Carolina won’t receive the nearly $350,000 it had left on its five-year, $1.6 million grant, said Lisa Bracken, the college’s vice president of student affairs.
“That $1.6 million, for us, was an awful lot of money,” she said.
How the grant was used
The college was using this latest grant round for three things — a program to flag and help students at risk of dropping or failing out of school, a staff member dedicated to placing healthcare students in internships and clinicals and a team of degree advisers.
Central Carolina, which has its main campus in Sumter plus three satellite campuses in Manning, Camden and Bishopville, managed to get budget approvals from the General Assembly to make four of these grant-funded employees permanent hires.
“Had we not done that, every bit of this would have gone away,” Bracken said, of those positions.
But the school had to let go two workers it could no longer pay, forcing other employees to take on the extra workload.

Nationwide, more than $250 million of the recalled federal funding was for the government’s Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which offers grants to colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic.
There was also $22 million for schools where at least 40% of the students are Black. The remaining $28 million went to schools with large populations of other minority groups.
In addition to Central Carolina, two other South Carolina colleges — Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College and Florence-Darlington Technical College — lost funding under the program for what are known as Predominantly Black Institutions, according to Kelly Steinhilper, a spokeswoman for the state technical college system.
Neither of the other two schools responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Exempt from cuts
Tribal colleges and historically Black colleges and universities, which are open to all students regardless of race, are exempt from the cuts and will actually receive more funding as the Education Department redistributes a total of $495 million from the grant money and other cancelled funds.
How much of that one-time funding will go to South Carolina HBCUs is unclear.
South Carolina State University, the state’s only public four-year HBCU, is waiting for additional details about how the Education Department will distribute the funding, spokesman Sam Watson said.
“SC State continues to work to ensure that our students have fair and adequate access to resources,” he said. “We will evaluate the specifics of this investment once they are available to determine its potential impact on SC State.”
The state’s six private HBCUs declined to comment or did not respond to the Gazette’s messages.
How cancelled National Institutes of Health grants are impacting SC college students

In eliminating the grants, the Education Department claimed they violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause and its implied guarantees to equal protection. The department argues that these programs create unconstitutional “racial quotas.”
“Discrimination based upon race or ethnicity has no place in the United States,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. “Diversity is not merely the presence of a skin color. Stereotyping an individual based on immutable characteristics diminishes the full picture of that person’s life and contributions, including their character, resiliency, and merit.”
But Central Carolina is legislatively mandated to serve students across Sumter, Lee, Clarendon, and Kershaw counties. The school has about 800 full-time students, 2,200 part-time students and 590 high school students enrolled in classes, according to data from the state higher education agency.
The school’s student body, which is 45% Black and 57% minority, reflects the population of those counties and is not a product of efforts to recruit minority students, Bracken said.
The way the school used its grants also benefited all students — not just students of color.
“The assumption is that those funds are helping a small number of students and that is not the case,” Bracken said.
Getting programs off the ground
The money allowed the college to pilot several programs, helping get those initiatives off the ground.
“Without those funds, we would have had a very difficult time building a tutoring center from the ground up,” Bracken said. “We also used it to build out a Career Services Center. Before we had that grant, we provided what career services we could through our admissions office, but we didn’t have the software tools or the center where students could get on computers.”
“It gets you out there to where you can launch some some key things that really make a difference with your students,” she said of the grant program.

Over the last four years, the school started an early alert program to try to keep students in school.
“If you’ve got a student who doesn’t show up for class during that first week, that’s a risk indicator,” Bracken said.
In the first week of this fall semester, the school already had almost 500 early alerts for students.
From there, a designated staff member, paid for by the grant, reached out to each of those students to find out why they hadn’t shown up and to let them know what services the school has available.
“Sometimes it’s ‘My work schedule has changed and I can’t make it to class. I’ve had a death in the family. We have a serious illness. I don’t have child care. I don’t have transportation,’ ” Bracken said. “Life issues have gotten in the way.”
But the students may not realize or don’t always remember the school and its partner organizations in the community can help.
“For example, somebody can’t pay their light bill and so they’re choosing to take extra shifts at work rather than come to class,” Bracken said. “We have some emergency money that we’re able to then pay their light bill for that month. Cars break down. We’ve paid for student car repairs.”
The school will now continue this early alert program using state funds.
What is ending
Before the grant allowed the school to hire designated advisers, professors were advising students on what classes to take. With thousands of students enrolled, it was easy for some to slip through the cracks, accidentally taking classes that may not count toward their degree and not knowing what classes might transfer if they chose to change their major.
The college also will continue the new advising program using state funds, minus a part-time adviser that worked at the school’s Camden campus.

The third program, which the college does not have the money to continue, was for a designated staff member trained to operate and maintain the school’s high-tech health care simulation lab. That staff member also made all of the clinical placements with the local hospitals for students to get on-the-job experience required for completing their degrees.
Those jobs will again fall back on the professors teaching those classes. The difference now is those degree programs have grown significantly.
Between an associate’s degree in nursing and a Licensed Practical Nursing program, surgical technology and medical assisting, the school has added 45 new students in the past five years. It’s pre-nursing program, which feeds into those other degrees, has doubled, going from 250 students to 500, Bracken said.
“We’re full every semester,” she said.

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A billion-dollar bond proposal and a significant change to how at-large council members are elected are among the questions Denver voters will weigh in on in the city’s 2025 municipal election.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races, and school board races.
In the Mile High City, the off-year election features eight ballot measures, the first five of which comprise a $950 million package of Vibrant Denver infrastructure bonds backed by Mayor Mike Johnston. Two other questions were referred to the ballot by City Council. The eighth and final measure, known as a veto referendum, was placed on the ballot through a signature-gathering campaign by opponents of City Council’s passage of a flavored tobacco ban last year.

Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
 Vibrant Denver bond
Denver voters will decide whether to approve Ballot Issues 2A–2E, five pieces of the city’s proposed bond package individually: transportation and mobility projects totaling $441 million; parks and recreation projects totaling $175 million; health and human services projects totaling $30 million; city infrastructure and facilities projects totaling $244 million; and housing and shelter projects totaling $59 million.
City governments regularly issue bond proposals to finance infrastructure projects by taking on debt, without raising taxes. Other recent “general obligation” bond issues in Denver included the $260 million RISE Denver bond in 2021 and the $936 million Elevate Denver bond in 2017.
The city says more than 200 individual projects will be funded through the Vibrant Denver proposal. A combined $139 million would go towards rebuilding the Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue viaducts adjacent to the proposed site of a new Denver Broncos stadium in Burnham Yard. Other major projects include a new $75 million combined training facility for the city’s sheriff, police and fire departments and $70 million to transform the former Park Hill Golf Club into a new city park. A full list of projects is available on the city’s website.
An issue committee registered in support of measures 2A through 2E has received more than $1 million in contributions from a long list of Denver-based businesses, according to city campaign finance records. Its top donor is former MDC Holdings executive Larry Mizel, who contributed $65,000, while the Denver Zoo, Denver Art Museum and Denver Botanic Gardens are among those that have contributed $50,000 each.
Citizens for No New Debt, a committee registered by activist Jason Bailey, had spent $3,170 in opposition to the bond package as of Oct. 10.
 Renaming the Department of Excise and Licensing
Question 2F was referred to the ballot by Denver City Council. It would change the name of the Department of Excise and Licensing, which issues business and professional licenses to bars, marijuana dispensaries, contractors and dozens of other kinds of businesses within Denver. The ballot measure would update the agency’s name to the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection, and amend language throughout the city’s municipal code to reflect the change.
The department calls the name change “part of an effort to modernize and make it easier to understand city government agency services.” Its current name is “confusing and misleading,” it says, because the department no longer handles the collection of excise taxes.
 At-large council elections
Question 2G, referred to the ballot by Denver City Council, would change how the city elects its two at-large members, who represent the entire city alongside 11 other members elected at the district level.
Currently, all candidates for at-large council seats run in a single race, with the top two vote-getters winning the two seats. In 2023, at-large council members Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Sarah Parady won their seats with 20% and 16% of the vote, respectively, from a field of 10 candidates.
Question 2G would significantly overhaul that process, dividing the at-large contest into separate races for “A” and “B” seats, and subjecting them to a runoff election if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.
The question was narrowly approved for the ballot by a 7-6 council vote, with Gonzales-Gutierrez, Parady and other progressive members opposed. By the same vote, council members defeated a progressive-backed proposal to put a ranked choice voting measure on the city’s 2025 ballot.
Supporters of the ballot measure, including the seven moderate council members, say the current system is confusing and allows unrepresentative candidates to win without majority support. Opponents call it an effort to target two of the council’s most progressive members.
Hands Off Denver Elections, a campaign committee formed “to reduce the influence of special interest big money,” has registered to oppose Referred Question 2G but had not reported any contributions as of Oct. 10. Its treasurer is Wynn Howell, Colorado state director of the Working Families Party.
 Flavored tobacco ban
In 2024, Denver City Council voted 11-1 to pass a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, flavored e-cigarette cartridges and flavored pouches and chews. Critics say these products are marketed to young people and put them at risk of nicotine addiction and other health impacts.
Opponents of the ban organized a signature-gathering campaign and collected the 9,400 valid signatures required to place a veto referendum on the 2025 ballot.
A yes vote on Referendum 310 will keep the ban in place. A no vote will repeal the ban.
A committee in support of the ban, Denver Kids vs. Big Tobacco, has raised more than $2 million to encourage a yes vote on Referendum 310, according to campaign finance records. Three-quarters of that funding came from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime benefactor of anti-tobacco causes.
Citizen Power, a committee registered to oppose the ban, has received over $434,000 in contributions from donors including the Rocky Mountain Smoke Free Alliance, a vaping industry trade group, as well as tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris.

(Getty Images)Idaho’s public schools are a historic place of pride in Idaho’s growth and cultural development. They continue to anchor communities’ social structures by providing actual places that signify community unity. Beyond being just places of learning, they are where we vote, see our children grow and mature into social beings, sponsor organized sports, music, and arts, and provide a stage for public participation in political and civic discussion. In many of Idaho’s smaller rural communities, they strum as the region’s most vital organ.
The drafters of Idaho’s constitution recognized the local importance of public schools by requiring that the state establish and maintain a “general, uniform, and thorough system of public, free common schools in a safe environment conducive to learning” for all school districts in the state.
Advocacy coalition files lawsuit to block Idaho’s new private school tax credit

In its 2004 and 2006 opinions in litigation against the state brought by the Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity, however, the Idaho Supreme Court exposed the failure to adequately fund our public schools. Sadly, instead of responding to these decisions with increased public-school funding, our Legislature has gone in a different direction, further damaging the state’s public school system. 
 In the 2025 session of the Idaho Legislature, the Legislature passed, and the governor signed, House Bill 93, providing up to $5,000 per student tax credit ($7,500 for special needs students) for any pupil enrolled in a private school. This law will contribute significantly to the continued gutting of our public school system for the benefit of a select and elite few.
Private secondary schools in Idaho costs on average between $9,000 and $12,000 per year, depending upon the set of sources reviewed. Thus, unless a family can pony up about double what the state offers for each student, private schooling will remain the privilege of richer families. 
A recent national study discovered that students already enrolled in private schools are the biggest beneficiaries of new voucher programs. Not surprising, the same study found some private schools used the new voucher money to raise their tuition charges. Thus, overall, the same fortunate few go to private schools, but the schools get more money at taxpayer expense. A pretty good boondoggle if a family already enjoys that system, but not much of benefit for the less prosperous.  
The House Bill 93 giveaway does not contain any performance measurements. While our public schools operate under a gaze measuring the quality of outcomes, House Bill 93 spending has no such dimension. There exists no means in the new private school subsidy to gauge whether state funding of private schools provides any successful education. The bill openly invites charlatans and hucksters into Idaho’s educational space.
House Bill 93 devotes $50 million annually to the new voucher subsidy for the well-to-do. This makes no economic sense for Idaho. 
While the Legislature wants to give the advantaged more advantages, we currently suffer a $79.9 million shortfall in the current fiscal year general budget, causing a 3% holdback to some state budgets, and a separate $60 million shortfall in our Medicaid budget.
 If this voucher giveaway went away, it would cover most of one of these shortfalls. This must make any taxpayer who cannot afford a private school for their children cringe at the unfairness of this system. And those of us who live in or near Idaho towns that do not have private schools cannot even participate in the system.
More disheartening, while Idaho’s investment in public school spending has fallen 15% in the last 20 years, we can expect the voucher subsidy to bloat about 200% to 300% in the next ten years, as it did in Florida, Arizona, and Indiana.   
House Bill 93 is simply a bad idea funded by all taxpayers for the benefit of a chosen few and private businesses at a time when Idaho suffers budget shortfalls. The better idea is to properly fund our constitutional public school system for the benefit of us all.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) An international organization that seeks to protect water quality in the Red River will conduct a review of two large dairy projects underway in North Dakota. 
The provincial government of Manitoba announced in a news release that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review information and permits related to the dairy operations.
Minnesota-based Riverview LLP plans to build two milking operations near the Red River, which flows north into Canada and Lake Winnipeg — the Herberg Dairy in Traill County with 25,000 cows and the Abercrombie Dairy in Richland County with 12,500 cows. 
Both dairies have received permits from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. That agency considers issues such as protecting groundwater and preventing polluted runoff into waterways. 
Marty Haroldson, director of the Division of Water Quality for the environmental agency, said it would answer questions or provide information to the International Joint Commission.
Manitoba Environment and Climate Change Minister Mike Moyes supported the decision by the International Joint Commission to assess the impacts of the projects on the Red River.
“The health of Manitoba’s lakes and rivers is a top priority for our government, and we want to be sure that developments upstream don’t negatively affect Lake Winnipeg and the Red River,” Moyes said in a news release Thursday. “We must protect Lake Winnipeg for generations to come.”
The Manitoba government and environmental groups are concerned about algae blooms in Lake Winnipeg, the world’s 10th largest fresh water lake. Nutrients from fertilizers, including cow manure, can contribute to algae blooms.

A letter from Moyes to North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong outlined the provincial government’s concerns. The letter said water quality monitoring in the Red River at the U.S.-Canada border shows that levels of nutrients are above target levels set by the two countries in 2022. 
In an emailed statement, Armstrong’s office said North Dakota follows state and federal laws related to permitting agricultural facilities. 
“Our state agencies apply the same high standards for protecting the Red River that they apply to all waters within North Dakota, and we have some of the safest drinking water in the country,” the Governor’s Office said.
The Manitoba Eco-Network, an environmental group, says Lake Winnipeg is one of the world’s most-threatened lakes with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus that can come from fertilizers. 
The state permits show that the cows from the two dairies would produce about 214 million gallons of manure each year. 
Environmental agency approves permit for large eastern North Dakota dairy

“Our dairies are designed, built and operated to be protective of the environment for generations to come,” Riverview said in a statement Friday. “Discharges to surface waters are prohibited by state and federal law, and our farms are designed and operated to meet or exceed strict environmental standards.”
Riverview squeezes out the liquid from its manure, separating it from the solids. The liquid manure is then transported through pipes or hoses to be injected into the soil of a farm field. There are no trucks hauling the liquid manure. 
Ted Preister, executive director of the Red River Basin Commission, a nonprofit group that has members from the U.S. and Canada, said the dairies have been a topic of discussion this summer, with Canadian officials seeking to learn more about the existing Riverview dairy operations in Minnesota and the planned dairies in North Dakota. 
He said the potential for 37,500 cows along the Red River is “a substantial concern” to Canadians who value Lake Winnipeg for its commercial fishing and recreation. 
Preister said the International Joint Commission can review permits to look for errors and can review water sampling reports to monitor for changes. If the commission finds something of concern, it would be up to Canada’s federal government to appeal to the U.S. Department of State. The commission’s findings could also be used in a legal challenge, he said. 
Preister said a visit to a Riverview dairy in Minnesota included Canadian representatives from the International Joint Commission, which can investigate pollution and water quality questions. 
He said Canadians asked “very pointed” questions of North Dakota’s Department of Environmental Quality, which approved permits for the two dairies.

Phone messages left with the International Joint Commission were not returned Friday.
Canada and the United States created the International Joint Commission to manage lakes and rivers along their border. 
The International Red River Watershed Board is an independent group established by the International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The board assists the commission in preventing or resolving disputes regarding the Red River and its tributaries. 
Madeline Luke has been the point person for the Dakota Resource Council on the group’s concerns about the large dairies.
“Pollution, like water, has no boundaries,” Luke said in an email. “The IJC is a non-political body with deep technical expertise. So with the urgent need to avoid further harm to Lake Winnipeg, this action is much applauded.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-13 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lack of care in Mississippi prisons turns treatable infection into life-threatening illness,Gwen Dilworth and Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/13/lack-of-care-hepatitis-c-mississippi-prisons/,"Potentially thousands of Mississippi inmates have hepatitis C, but only a fraction receive treatment and officials aren't using available resources to get lower-cost medications.","Only a fraction of Mississippi inmates diagnosed with hepatitis C receive treatment, which has allowed the treatable infection to develop into a life-threatening illness, interviews and documents obtained by Mississippi Today reveal. 
As many as 845 people incarcerated in Mississippi Department of Corrections facilities were confirmed to be living with hepatitis C between January and March of this year, records show. During the same period, 48 people – or less than 6% with documented diagnoses – received treatment. 
But in private, officials have at times cited a much higher caseload – 5,000 cases out of about 19,000 people incarcerated by the state. This suggests that public records may reveal only a small portion of a widespread hepatitis C problem in Mississippi’s prisons, a state lawmaker with direct oversight over the corrections department told Mississippi Today. 
As people in the care of the state suffer and the treatable illness continues to fester, she said, officials aren’t using resources available to them to lower the costs of medications. 
This year’s treatment numbers represent an improvement over last year, when 19 people in state prisons – or 2% with diagnoses – received medication for hepatitis C. In 2020, only three people received treatment.

Department of Corrections spokesperson Kate Head did not answer questions from Mississippi Today about why at least hundreds of people in its custody with the contagious illness are not receiving treatment. But she said the agency’s medical contractor “is responsible for providing appropriate medical treatment to inmates with all medical conditions, including Hep C.” 
VitalCore Health Strategies, a company that holds a three-year, $357-million contract to provide medical care to Mississippi prisoners, declined to comment. The company was previously awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
Data obtained by Mississippi Today show a clear disparity between the number of people who test positive for the virus and the number of people who receive treatment. 
Behind closed doors, state officials and VitalCore executives have been briefed on a much larger volume of cases, House Corrections Chairwoman Rep. Becky Currie told Mississippi Today. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world. Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, has oversight of Mississippi’s prison system and those who manage it. During a private meeting at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County with some of these leaders, Currie said Dr. Raman Singh, VitalCore’s chief medical officer, told her and State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney that about 5,000 MDOC prisoners and some prison workers had contracted hepatitis C. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain shared the same number with her in a separate meeting, Currie said. 
Singh did not respond to requests for comment.

MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether such conversations occurred. Department of Health spokesperson Greg Flynn said Dr. Edney did not believe it would be appropriate to comment on a private conversation, but he said it “absolutely could be the case” that as many as 5,000 people incarcerated in Mississippi suffer from hepatitis C. 
Mississippi Today identified inconsistencies in testing and diagnosis numbers, such as low numbers of tests that resulted in large increases in new diagnoses, obtained through public-records requests. “Data collection and streamlining of the reception and diagnostic unit” contributed to the discrepancies, Head said.

During a series of tours of Mississippi prisons last year, Currie, who is a registered nurse, said she witnessed prisoners suffering from a wide range of health ailments, including hepatitis C, without treatment. The suffering is preventable, and raises questions about how hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent, she said.
Currie called the denial of hepatitis C medication in Mississippi prisons a “public health crisis” that she couldn’t look away from as a nurse and a Christian. 
“This is morally wrong,” she said. 
A cure to count on
Hepatitis C can be treated with a type of highly effective antiviral medication that cures more than 95% of patients in a matter of weeks. Nonetheless, there are over 10,000 hepatitis C-related deaths in the U.S. each year.
Left untreated, the contagious blood-borne virus can cause serious health problems, including liver disease, liver failure and cancer. It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S. 
Hepatitis C proliferates in state prisons across the country, where its prevalence is nine times greater than the general population. 
Risk factors for hepatitis C, such as injecting drugs, overlap with those for incarceration, said Dr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who studies hepatitis C in prisons. She formerly served as medical director for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. 
Spaulding said prisons should make the medication available to every person who wants treatment.
“There should be no reason why a prison can’t treat most of their patients,” Spaulding said.
The first treatment for hepatitis C arrived in the 1980s. But the medication had low success rates and debilitating side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression and suicidal ideation. 
A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. 
“The cure is something that you can really count on,” Spaulding said. “So it’s gone from a difficult-to-treat infection to an infection that is much, much simpler and effective (to treat).”
But the breakthrough in treatment has meant little for most Mississippi prisoners with hepatitis C, who have been fighting for years to receive the medication in prison. 
“It is a problem that has been left so long without any answers,” Currie said. 
In 2017, Chad Spiers, then incarcerated at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville, filed a lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the medical contractor at the time for denying him medication after he tested positive for hepatitis C. 
Magistrate Judge Robert H. Walker dismissed Spiers’ complaint, ruling that his care was constitutional because, though he did not receive medication, he was monitored for progression of the illness. 
“The Constitution guarantee (sic) prisoners ‘only adequate, not optimal medical care,’” reads the ruling. 
The Department of Corrections’ hepatitis management policy obtained by Mississippi Today says it will provide treatment for people with hepatitis C diagnoses “when indicated.” Spokesperson Head did not respond to questions about which cases warrant treatment. 
But a person with direct knowledge of medical care inside Mississippi’s prisons, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about how inmates are treated, said prisons are financially incentivized to wait to treat inmates until they get sick enough for prison officials to justify purchasing the expensive medication. 
“(Prison staff) were told he’s not sick enough yet,” the person said. 
The medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course, the person said. 
However, many state prison systems have negotiated cheaper prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Delaying treatment runs counter to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which say clinicians should treat people and not wait for the illness to resolve spontaneously.
The CDC’s guidance should be applied to people who are incarcerated, said Dr. Kate LeMasters, as assistant professor at the University of Colorado who studies the public health implications of the prison system.
Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms, and about 25% will spontaneously clear the infection without treatment. The disease is slow moving and can take years for symptoms to show. But left untreated, it can wreak havoc on a person’s immune system, turning their skin yellow from jaundice and causing joint pain that leaves them immobile. Its longer-term health consequences, such as liver failure and cancer, are life-threatening.
“What we do now is that we let them get sick and die, or we let them get so sick that they get a liver disease, cirrhosis or cancer, and they die,” Currie said. 
Disincentives and unused discounts
Even as the price of costly medication has fallen and treatment has become more effective, some state prison systems argue that treating hepatitis C is prohibitively expensive. 
Several states have negotiated innovative payment models to treat people and prevent the spread of the disease inside and outside of prison walls. 
Some use what is called the “Netflix” model – a subscription-based program that gives a state unlimited treatment doses during a fixed period. Other states have negotiated lower costs with pharmaceutical companies or obtained the medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
In its February 2024 contract proposal, VitalCore wrote it was “confident” it would be able to access discounted prices for hepatitis C medications using the 340B program. 
“We have had tremendous success in accessing 340B purchasing and pricing in other similar contracts for the purpose of purchasing more expensive medications such as those for the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C,” the proposal reads. 
In the 2025 legislative session, a bill proposed by Currie would have required the Mississippi Departments of Health and Corrections to establish a hepatitis C program for inmates and work to obtain the medication at a discounted price through the 340B program. 
The legislation passed the House with a large bipartisan majority, but didn’t survive negotiations with the Senate, in part because of a disagreement over the bill’s proposed audit of prison health care. 
MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether they receive 340B pricing for hepatitis C drugs. University of Mississippi Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital system, did not respond to a request for comment about whether the hospital partners with VitalCore to obtain discounted hepatitis C medication. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing several months ago, but the agency has not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, Health Department spokesperson Flynn told Mississippi Today. 
“The Department of Health has given information about how to go about getting 340B pricing and joining the program to the Department of Corrections,” Flynn said. “But to our knowledge, they are not utilizing the 340B, at least not that we know of right now.” 
This means the Corrections Department isn’t making use of the tools it has to purchase hepatitis C medications at a cheaper price, Currie said. 
“They’ve been able to get it all along,” she said.
A fate no one deserves
One study suggests it is most cost-effective to test and treat hepatitis C widely and provide linkage to care when people are released from prison because it prevents expensive complications and limits the spread of the infection. 
“It’s going to cost the taxpayers more because we don’t initially treat it,” Currie said. 
Currie told Mississippi Today she has personally asked the corrections department to treat several people she met while touring the prison system last year. One was “literally about on his deathbed” before receiving treatment, but has shown significant improvement since receiving medication, she said. 
Despite evidence that suggests broad testing and treatment save money in the long run, Mississippi does not test widely for hepatitis C. Testing is performed “when deemed clinically indicated by the healthcare providers,” who take into consideration risk factors and the probability a patient has hepatitis C, Head said. 
Incarceration itself is a risk factor for hepatitis C, given its high prevalence in prisons, LeMasters said. 
“Everyone should be screened when entering prison because people who have a history of incarceration are considered at risk,” she said. 
Opt-out testing, where patients are tested unless they specifically decline it, is the most effective way to identify hepatitis C, Spaulding said. 
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the U.S. with a constitutional right to health care. MDOC has told Mississippi Today that it provides health care to prisoners that meets constitutional standards. 
But a former top corrections official, after reading Mississippi Today’s coverage of prison health care issues, turned over internal communications to the news outlet that revealed top prison officials bemoaning the poor medical care provided to prisoners. 
Inside prison facilities, hepatitis C patients are denied lifesaving medication – a fate no one, not even people convicted of crimes, deserves, Currie said. 
“Our whole ‘because you’re in jail, we don’t care if you die’ program really doesn’t work for me,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10114223/mt-prison-health-story3-featimage-03_720.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Arguments about the First Amendment, which, to many, is the most sacrosanct of the articles in the U.S. Constitution Bill of Rights, are a constant in American democracy. 
Witness how Tennessee’s new buffer zone law demanding journalists stay 25 feet from law enforcement could trip up reporters in Memphis trying to document federal forces— including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, U.S. Marshals and Drug Enforcement Administration plus an extra 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers and members of the Tennessee National Guard — occupying the majority Black city by the hundreds.
In the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers passed the measure to establish a 25-foot “buffer zone” that allows law enforcement officers to order members of the media and public to remain 25 feet away from crime scenes, traffic stops and any “ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.”
The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, and Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, creates a Class B misdemeanor for violations of the buffer zone. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

“As you can imagine, journalists appear within 25 feet of law enforcement officers doing their day job every day,” said Grayson Clary, staff attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP,) which provides legal support to journalists. 
Similar laws have been challenged in Indiana and Louisiana, where lawyers with the RCFP have prevailed and obtained preliminary injunctions to enforcement of the laws. 
The Lookout is part of a coalition of Tennessee media outlets and companies, including the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA that has sued the state of Tennessee in federal court over the new law. 
“These buffer laws jeopardize reporters’ ability to bring their communities some of the news that matters most — about crime, disaster response, police misconduct, and more,” said Clary, who is representing the media coalition alongside Paul McAdoo, RCFP’s Local Legal Initiative attorney for Tennessee. “When law enforcement pushes the press out of eye and earshot, it’s the public that ultimately loses out.”
On October 3, six Memphis area state lawmakers sent a letter to WHBQ Fox 13, accusing the station of endangering law enforcement officials for airing a link to a tip line. 
Fox 13 asked viewers to let the station know about locations of task force operations and agents as they engaged with detentions and arrests throughout the city, presumably so their reporters and photographers could observe and report on the activities of the Memphis Safe Communities Task Force.

This is Journalism 101. Every news outlet worth its salt, including the Lookout, asks readers or viewers to provide story tips. 
Yet, state Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican, seemed to find it unusual. “It is outrageous that a local TV station would work against these efforts by tipping off offenders and endangering the officers sworn to protect us. This irresponsible reporting must stop so law enforcement can do its job without interference,” he said in a press release sent by state House Republican Caucus staff. 
If armed federal law enforcement and Tennessee Highway Patrol officers can’t manage being photographed by TV journalists, they might not be best equipped to deal with the more serious issues of crime they are allegedly in Memphis to handle . Surely, these hundreds of agents aren’t so fragile they need the protection of a handful of state lawmakers. 
This raises the question of why our elected officials would want to call out reporters and imply they are a threat. These are the same lawmakers who often pledge strict allegiance to the Constitution and to smaller government: Rose’s website says he’s a “strong believer in less government,” yet here he is, inserting government into an industry expressly protected by the First Amendment. 
One wonders if Tennessee’s lawmakers don’t understand the Constitution as well as they claim to or if this is another case of overreach by members of the legislature’s supermajority because they can. Either way, the continued treading on free speech and the free press won’t stand: Tennessee’s media outlets, including the Lookout, will continue to bring accountability to the public and uphold the First Amendment.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Maryland this month finalized a $340 million deal with Constellation Energy to relicense the Conowingo Dam in Cecil County, ending years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty. The agreement restores the state’s authority to enforce water quality standards under the Clean Water Act and sets a possible precedent for dozens of hydroelectric relicensing cases nationwide expected in coming years.
The deal includes direct and associated investments in habitat restoration, trash and debris removal, aquatic life passage and other environmental priorities.
The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) will have oversight of the agreement, with input from two advocacy groups—Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association—who challenged and helped overturn an earlier settlement they argued was legally and environmentally deficient.
The revised settlement reasserts a 2018 Water Quality Certification that Maryland had previously waived in its 2019 deal with Exelon, the dam’s previous operator. That waiver prompted the advocacy groups to file a legal challenge, leading to a 2023 federal appeals court ruling that tossed the license granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The new agreement binds Constellation, the dam’s current operator, to terms enforceable by both state and federal regulators.
Gov. Wes Moore hailed the agreement as a major step for environmental protection and energy security.
“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Moore said in a statement. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers. By bringing everyone to the table, we have struck an agreement that is good for the environment, good for energy production, and good for Marylanders.”
Environmental advocates also celebrated the deal as precedent-setting.
“This agreement shows what can be accomplished with the Clean Water Act as it is,” said Evan Isaacson, senior attorney with the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, who represented the environmental groups in the case. “Constellation and all parties are legally bound by the terms of the settlement.”
The Conowingo Dam, located on the Susquehanna River, the Bay’s biggest tributary, has long been a thorny issue in Bay restoration efforts. For more than a decade, advocates maintained that the dam’s reservoir, intended to trap sediment and nutrients flowing downstream, was filled with silt that reduced its effectiveness. During large storm events, massive pollution loads from the reservoir escaped into the Bay, exacerbating reduced oxygen or “dead” zones and upending cleanup goals.
Under the new settlement, Constellation has committed to spending $340 million over the 50-year license term, with restoration efforts focused on areas within Maryland’s side of the Lower Susquehanna watershed. Of the total committed sum, $87.6 million will go to pollution reduction and resiliency projects, including shoreline restoration and planting of underwater grasses that produce oxygen, stabilize sediments and provide habitat for countless species.
Another $77.8 million is allocated for removing trash and debris, while $28 million will go to improving fish and eel passage at the dam. A freshwater mussel hatchery, aimed at natural water filtration, will receive $23.3 million. The settlement also includes funding for invasive species control and other restoration priorities.
Just $18.7 million is designated for dredging studies and related activities. Environmentalists and scientists remain split on whether dredging is the right solution. Studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state of Maryland have found dredging to be expensive—costing billions of dollars over decades—and potentially disruptive to aquatic life.
Still, groups like the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper argue that without some removal of the built-up sediment, the dam will remain a significant source of Bay pollution.
In written comments to Inside Climate News, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Ted Evgeniadis said his organization’s appeal of the 2019 license centered on its failure to address the sediment buildup behind the dam. “The dam alters the timing and delivery of sediment and nutrients to the river and Bay by scour events,” Evgeniadis said. “Providing a pathway for dredging was one of our top priorities.”
He described the 2025 agreement as a durable framework with meaningful oversight provisions, particularly in early implementation years. His organization will participate in annual consultations on how the mitigation fund is used, including around dredging. Evgeniadis noted that future federal funding may be needed to cover the costs of actual dredging if it proceeds.
“The agreement provides Maryland with funding to get many different projects done,” he said. “For dredging particularly, there will be a need for future support from the Maryland delegation and/or federal government for funding gaps to get the initial upfront investments going.”
Evgeniadis said his benchmarks for the agreement’s success include expanded biodiversity, increased migratory fish passage and fewer sediment runoff events from the dam, all of which could reduce the frequency and severity of dead zones in the Bay.
But some experts are skeptical that dredging will significantly change the trajectory of Bay cleanup efforts.
Donald Boesch, a leading estuarine scientist and former president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, said the data simply doesn’t support it.
Boesch pointed to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals, the pollution diet for the Bay. He noted that 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 1.7 million pounds of phosphorus still need to be reduced from the Susquehanna to meet those targets. By contrast, the estimated impact of sediment buildup behind the dam adds 6 million pounds of nitrogen and 0.3 million pounds of phosphorus to that load.
“Upstream controls are a seven-times bigger challenge,” Boesch said. “The $88 million water-quality portion of the agreement should strive to achieve these offsetting load reductions.”
He said that multiple studies, including those by the Army Corps, have concluded dredging the Conowingo reservoir would be extremely costly and of limited effectiveness. “The agreement includes a further assessment of feasibility and effectiveness, not large-scale dredging per se,” Boesch said.
Despite this long-running disagreement, advocates and experts agreed that the settlement’s most significant feature is the reassertion of Maryland’s authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. The clause allows states to place conditions on federally licensed projects to ensure compliance with state water quality standards.
Isaacson, of the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, said the 2019 settlement fell short in part because it attempted to retroactively waive this authority. “The previous attempt to waive the 2018 certification was found to be invalid by a federal appellate court,” he said, implying that the previous settlement left no enforceable mechanism to get the dam owner to fulfill its obligations.
The new agreement, he said, gives Maryland the tools to hold Constellation accountable. “They know MDE, FERC, the Waterkeepers, elected officials and the public are watching, and they know what they publicly committed to,” Isaacson said.
Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association now have a formal role in monitoring compliance, including input on project priorities funded by the settlement. Constellation, which took over dam operations from Exelon in early 2022, is required to maintain a website for public disclosure of non-confidential documents submitted to MDE, while the agency itself will keep a separate webpage dedicated to the dam’s licensing.
Robin Broder, acting executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said the revised settlement is a major step forward and emphasized the importance of launching restoration projects early. “Many of the payments are frontloaded so projects can be launched early in the license’s term so we begin to see restoration and improvements of fisheries, habitats and water quality as soon as possible,” she said.
Broder said that while the settlement doesn’t impose binding requirements on upstream states like Pennsylvania and New York, where the majority of the Susquehanna’s nutrient pollution originates, it includes a commitment to advocate for stronger conditions in future relicensing of upstream dams such as Holtwood and Safe Harbor.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which was not a party to the settlement but joined legal challenges to the 2019 waiver, also welcomed the new agreement. Paul Smail, the foundation’s vice president for litigation and general counsel, said the revised deal offers stronger environmental commitments and accountability.
“The biggest difference is that the Waterkeepers were not at the negotiation table in 2019,” Smail said. “In this current 2025 agreement, there is more funding available for environmental mitigation projects.”
Smail said Constellation should be held responsible for maintaining sediment levels in the dam’s pool, but stressed that upstream pollution reductions are just as important. “The dam affects how and when sediment and nutrients, particularly phosphorus during sediment scouring events, are released into Chesapeake Bay,” he said. “However, it’s also critical that upstream sources of the sediment and nutrient pollution must be reduced.”
He said the public should expect to see clear deliverables over the first five years, especially on restoration and resiliency projects in the Maryland portion of the watershed. “The actions of the Waterkeepers on behalf of the public, and ongoing citizen enforcement, have been and will continue to be key to accountability,” Smail said.
All parties seem to agree that the Conowingo agreement will serve as a model for how states and citizen groups can shape federal relicensing decisions. Isaacson said the deal sets a precedent in its use of the Clean Water Act to address emerging challenges like sediment scouring due to more frequent extreme storms.
“There will be a lot of major hydroelectric projects coming up for relicensing in the coming years and many of them may share similar issues,” he said. “We secured a major victory here, but there’s no doubt it took a lot of persistence.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

A handful of Pennsylvania counties mistakenly issued duplicate mail ballots to a few of their voters in recent weeks. 
Why that happened is unclear — state and county officials gave different explanations — but they cautioned that the error would have not resulted in anyone being able to have their vote counted twice.
State and county officials said they have found that a total of 68 potential duplicate mail ballots were mistakenly issued. In some of these cases, they said, the ballots may not have reached voters, as the mistake may have been caught after a second ballot label was generated but before a duplicate ballot was actually mailed to the voter. 
In Luzerne County, in northeast Pennsylvania, 31 voters received duplicate mail ballots, WVIA reported Tuesday. State officials initially said that the problem was isolated to that one county, but acknowledged a small number of other counties experienced similar issues — although potentially for different reasons — after inquiries from Votebeat and Spotlight PA. 
Using publicly available information on mail ballot requests, Votebeat and Spotlight PA identified a few other counties that appeared to have issued duplicate ballots. Election officials in Dauphin, Montgomery, and Carbon counties confirmed that some voters in their counties had been issued or received duplicate mail ballots as well. 
Emily Cook, election director for Luzerne County, told WVIA that the cause was an unknown problem with the state election management system, known as SURE. 
But Jonathan Marks, deputy secretary of the commonwealth, said the duplicate labels were created in a variety of ways, and at least some stemmed from user error as counties tried to fix an issue with the first mail ballot. SURE’s user interface has shortcomings, he acknowledged, and resolving one issue can create another if counties don’t use the ideal method. Marks said the state is looking at how to improve it.
The Department of State said counties sometimes print duplicate labels for other reasons, such as damage to the original label. “A duplicate label’s existence does not automatically mean an error has occurred,” the department said in a statement. 
Both county and state officials stressed that the duplicate ballots have been canceled, and could not be cast or counted. In addition, each ballot return envelope has a unique barcode associated with the voter. When a county receives a ballot back, the code is scanned into the SURE system and it marks the voter as having voted. If a second barcode tied to the same voter were to be scanned, the system would reject the ballot. 
After learning of the duplicate mail ballots in Luzerne, state election officials audited the SURE system to check for any additional duplicates, and found 37 potential cases across seven other counties. 
In Dauphin County, which includes Harrisburg, Election Director Chris Spackman said the county was informed by the department on Tuesday that “a routine internal review of the SURE system” had discovered a single duplicate ballot sent to a Dauphin voter. Spackman added that his deputy was informed by a contractor who helps the department manage the SURE system that the error was the contractor’s, but he knew no other details. 
Megan Alt, a spokesperson for Montgomery County, west of Philadelphia, said the county had notified the state Wednesday morning of a potential duplicate, and workers subsequently discovered three other voters who had received duplicate ballots “as a result of files received from the state’s system.”
Carbon County’s election director, Jennifer Ketchledge, confirmed that her county issued 20 duplicate labels for mail voters. She said the department reached out to her Tuesday and informed her, and the county canceled the additional ballots.
“I have no clue” why it happened, she said, adding that the state was looking into it. 
Even if two mailing labels for ballots are generated for the same voter, Ketchledge said the vendor that handles the county’s mail ballot printing and shipping would catch it before the duplicate ballot was actually sent. 
Cook, the Luzerne election director, did not respond to a request for comment, but county officials told other news outlets the SURE system shouldn’t allow such errors to happen. 
“Assuming that the state’s excuse is accurate, how broken is the SURE system if it cannot safeguard against a county inadvertently sending two labels for the same voter?” Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo told The Citizen’s Voice Wednesday.
“There is nothing sure about the SURE system,” Crocamo added. “The upgrades to SURE system can’t happen soon enough.”
The state said the SURE system’s primary safeguard “is a mechanism that prevents recording more than one ballot per voter in a single election.”

(Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence)PENNINGTON GAP, Va. — On a Saturday evening in June, people of this rural region gathered at the historic Lee Theatre to celebrate the founding of Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence.
Author Barbara Kingsolver opened the facility in January with royalties from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Demon Copperhead,” whose plot revolves around Appalachia’s opioid crisis. The home offers a supportive place for people to stay while learning to live without drugs. Kingsolver had asked the women now living there to join her on stage.

Kingsolver, who grew up on the edge of Appalachia in Kentucky’s Nicholas County, suggested the women share with the audience what they were most proud of having gained from their first weeks at Higher Ground. But she learned they were more eager to brag on one another.
Supporters say Higher Ground provides stability and a reentry point after leaving jail, prison, or a treatment center. It offers a range of services and support in an area devastated by addiction to painkilling pills and other types of opioids. Most fundamentally, it’s a true home, with one- and two-person bedrooms, a communal kitchen, and a den. Residents say they have found affirmation from a cohort of women who understand how addiction can demoralize a person and estrange them from family and community.
Ronda Morgan, a resident, said her family has always been in her corner. But while she was serving a jail sentence for drug possession, she told herself, “I’m sick of them having to do time with me.” She was ready for recovery. Her daughter, who’s a nurse, told her about Higher Ground, the first facility of its kind in sprawling, rural Lee County. Morgan learned she could live there for up to two years to gain the footing that had eluded her in three-plus decades of addiction.
What she didn’t anticipate was the kinship she forged with her housemates — among them, Syara Parsell — and with Higher Ground’s staff.
Parsell, 35, one of Higher Ground’s first residents, said that in her time there she’s received help finding employment and enrolling in community college courses.
From the staff and Kingsolver, Parsell said, she has received judgment-free support. “Together,” she said, “we figure it out.”
Traditional treatment facilities typically operate under highly structured medical supervision. Recovery houses, like Higher Ground, offer a more relaxed environment, helping move a resident “toward being an independent, fully functional, self-reliant human being,” said Marvin Ventrell, CEO of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
“Recovery occurs in the community,” he said. But reentry must be approached delicately. “When addiction occurs with a human being, it also occurs within a family social structure.” If a person in early recovery returns to a family that’s unprepared, that person’s chances of success “are severely diminished.”
For Kingsolver, the opioid crisis became a focal point for what she hoped would be “the great Appalachian novel.” The epidemic “has changed so much of the texture of this place,” devastating families and communities.
Pharmaceutical companies targeted central Appalachia for sales of what they falsely claimed were addiction-resistant prescription opioids. Kingsolver wanted to “cast my net back over all of the extractive industries that have come to this place, taken out what was good, and left behind a mess.”
“The way I put it is, ‘They came to harvest our pain when there was nothing else left,’” she said.

In research for “Demon Copperhead,” she immersed herself in the stories of people who’ve navigated addiction and those who care and advocate for them.
The novel has been an enormous success, having sold more than 3 million copies and earning far more than her previous works. Kingsolver decided to dedicate hundreds of thousands of dollars to address the crisis that has overwhelmed the region where she was raised — and to which she returned full time in 2004.
Again, she set about listening. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, she determined that a women’s recovery home was the wisest investment.
Joie Cantrell works as a public health nurse in harm reduction for the Virginia Department of Health, supporting policies and practices to curb the negative effects of drug use, and serves as Higher Ground’s board chair. She had long recognized the need for just such a home.
“That was the part that was missing,” Cantrell said. Too often, when someone would come out of a treatment facility or incarceration, “we lost them. They fell back into the same old patterns.” She said the region sorely needed a safe, stable environment where women could recalibrate.
By August, the home reached its capacity of seven women. It’s right in town, “which is so important,” Kingsolver said, “because in this part of the country we have no public transportation.”
Parsell has long suffered from social anxieties; drugs were her escape. Here, her housemates embraced her. They’ve offered the support she’d never experienced.
“Every two seconds, someone’s like, ‘Syara’s here!’” she said. “I’m very grateful for it.” If there’s an issue in the house, “one of the seven of us has the solution.”
Four residents are employed outside the home, one is enrolled in community college classes, one is completing her GED with plans to continue her education, and everyone volunteers in the community. Crafting classes are offered. Family members visit.
“They’re living life,” said Subrenda Huff, who was filling in while director Liz Brooks took maternity leave.

Morgan said she accomplished more in a month at Higher Ground than she had in years. That includes applying for identification documents, taking budgeting classes, and seeking permanent housing. It includes sharing upkeep duties in the house.
Such was Kingsolver’s vision. But, she said, “here’s what I didn’t expect: The community embraced this with loving arms. I thought maybe people would say, ‘I don’t want this in my backyard.’”
Most of the furniture was donated. Kingsolver’s quarter-million or so social media followers have been instrumental in that. “But it’s not just book clubs in Switzerland or in California; it’s people in Pennington Gap,” she said. Church groups have donated “quilts, bedside lamps, things to hang on the walls just to make it homey.”
Before the facility opened, local folks volunteered to pull weeds, take down an old fence, and put up a new one. Kingsolver said the well of support “has been just endless. It’s been deep, and loving, and a wonder to see.”
Higher Ground, with only one paid staff member, has estimated yearly operating costs of $120,000, Cantrell said. Residents are charged $50 a week. Ventrell said that fees at other recovery houses vary widely but that $2,500 a month is an approximate average.
“We want them to focus on saving money and paying any restitution or fines they may have from past charges,” Cantrell said. “Some may be focused on repaying child support they may owe.”
Higher Ground receives no federal or state funding. Donations continue to pour in. And Kingsolver recently bought the building next door with plans to open a thrift shop, which would be a source of additional income for the home and offer retail work experience for its residents.
Supporters aspire to open more Higher Ground homes elsewhere in the region.
What these women are gaining, Kingsolver said, “is not just sobriety, but belief in themselves.”

Over the past few months, after municipal employees have clocked out, their work computers have stayed on for a little self-improvement — specifically, overnight updates pushed by the city’s IT team to install Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system (OS).
It’s all to outrun the Tuesday, Oct. 14, deadline, when Windows 10 will reach its “end of support.” After that, computers all over the globe that still run Windows 10 will cease receiving “technical assistance, feature updates and security updates,” in Microsoft’s words. For government IT departments, it’s not an option to run fleets of computers sans the latest security tweaks, especially since they’re connected to a city’s most vital functions.
To stay secure, Microsoft recommends upgrading machines to Windows 11. Because of hardware limitations, many cannot. The other options are to pay Microsoft for extended security updates, or to leave the machines in the past and hope for the best. 
Budget documents from the past two years show scattered evidence of local government officials scrambling to address the changeover to Windows 11.
The Community College of Rhode Island asked for $1.17 million in its fiscal year 2025 budget request to replace faculty and staff laptops and PCs which couldn’t be upgraded. The Rhode Island Office of the Public Defender noted in its fiscal year 2026 budget request that its technology ask was 7.38% higher than for 2025 partially because it needed Windows 11-compatible replacements. A March 2024 budget presentation in Jamestown suggested the island town needed $33,600 to swap out its old computers which couldn’t run Windows 11.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission also received an additional $97,443 in its tech coffer for fiscal year 2025, but the quasi-public agency’s executive director Jason Gramitt wrote in an Oct. 9 email that most of that money went toward a new case management system. The new Windows 11 workstations only cost $8,179 in comparison, Gramitt wrote. 
Pawtucket has largely avoided these expensive options as most of its existing PCs could be upgraded “in place,” said Hersh Cristino, Pawtucket’s chief information and innovation officer, in a recent phone interview. The few machines which couldn’t join the future could be repurposed as “not mission critical” hardware, he added.
“You know, like, ‘Oh yeah, I’m doing a training. Somebody needs to grab a laptop,’” Cristino said. 
Governments have less flexibility than private industry when it comes to big upgrades, Cristino said. He sketched a hypothetical scenario: “You’re in the middle of taking a tax payment, and then you need to upgrade the person’s machine. ‘Oh, sorry. Come back in an hour.’” 
“The challenge is always downtime,” Cristino said, which is why Pawtucket’s IT team — which manage the city’s municipal computers as well those in its school district —  have used the nighttime to minimize possible annoyance for non-IT staff. The upgrade process involves creating a configuration profile with Windows 11, which is then deployed and loaded onto PCs in small batches nightly. Each upgrade usually takes a little over an hour, Cristino said, and the refreshed machines are ready for city workers when they return in the morning. 
Cristino, who took over the city’s IT department in 2012, said the upgrade process this time around has been gentle on installers and users alike. When it comes to mass upgrades, problems can arise “any time you move somebody’s cheese,” Cristino said. Staff can be disoriented by the sudden changes that updates can bring to their work PCs, like relocated taskbars or different menus. 
But the Windows 11 rollout is not as dramatic as transitions in the past: “It’s one of those kinds of upgrades where you look, and you don’t even notice for the most part that you’ve upgraded,” Cristino said. 
Phillip Carlucci, the IT director in Warwick, is likewise unfazed by the upgrade process in his city hall. 
“Just another technology project,” Carlucci wrote in an email. “Fairly routine.”
About 500 Warwick machines were still running Windows 10 at the end of September, but Carlucci was confident the process would be finished by the deadline.

Long lead time to prepare
The deadline to upgrade was no surprise. Windows 10 hit the market in July 2015 and, like most versions of Microsoft’s iconic OS, it became a mainstay of homes, businesses and governments. But the end was officially nigh when, in April 2023, Microsoft announced Windows 10’s end of support.Windows 11 was released in October 2021 and only overtook Windows 10 in popularity in March 2025, according to StatCounter, a website which estimates market share and OS usage through web browser-collected data.
Upgrading to Windows 11 is free on compatible machines, so a tech budget won’t need to stretch much to accommodate Windows 11 if a town or agency’s computers are relatively modern. \
But unlike its older siblings, Windows 11 is pickier about its playmates. It will only install and run on a machine that fulfills a heavier slate of security requirements related to its processor, firmware, and the inclusion of something called the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which is typically a hardware chip installed on a computer’s motherboard. Many older machines lack this chip and it is usually unfeasible or outright impossible to add one.
Jim Silveria, Providence’s director of Information Technology, said in a recent phone interview that after about a year and a half of upgrades, the capital city’s move to Windows 11 was “99% complete.” The city was able to allocate some of its American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds before they evaporated to help the Windows 11 transition, Silveria said. 
Any machines not able to be upgraded by Tuesday’s cutoff — “stragglers,” Silveria called them — would be severed from the city’s network. Sometimes, peripherals or specific software used by governments can further complicate the process, as software vendors may not have updated certain programs in a long time, leaving them incompatible with Windows 11. In Providence, one of the machines that may have its internet privileges revoked is a receipt printer used in the Recorder of Deeds’ office.
“It’s been in use for at least 10 years,” Silveria said. “We weren’t able to find a driver.”
So far, so good
The upgrade process has gone relatively smoothly in Rhode Island — at least according to IT officials willing to be interviewed by Rhode Island Current. 
Cranston finished its upgrade in about three months, swapping out any computers that couldn’t make the move upward, according to city spokesperson Zack DeLuca. Bristol Municipal Operations Manager Eric Dickervitz wrote in a recent email that the town had no more devices on Windows 10, as it “routinely upgrade[s]” its equipment. 
Even a small town like New Shoreham, the sole municipality on Block Island, is feeling ready. The town lacks a dedicated in-house IT team and uses a managed service provider, Town Manager Amy Land said in a recent email. “The town doesn’t have any concerns about the Windows 10 end of life,” Land said.

– Hersh Cristino, Pawtucket’s chief information and innovation officer on the challenge of preparing the city’s software for the end of Windows 10


But a number of municipalities did not respond to multiple requests for interviews from Rhode Island Current. Two municipalities — East Providence and Middletown — did respond but without specifics. 
“The Town of Middletown and its School Department have been well aware of the upcoming situation with Windows 10 and have a solid plan in place that we believe will address the transition without any interruptions to our staff, residents and businesspeople,” Matt Sheley, a town spokesperson, wrote over email.
East Providence spokesperson Matthew Paddock, meanwhile, wrote, “The City of East Providence is currently in the process of updating our operating systems to Windows 11, maintaining industry standard.”
At the state level, as of Oct. 2, only 27 computers still needed upgrades. The process moved quickly, as evidenced by an earlier count from Aug. 20 which counted 1,247 computers in need of upgrades.
Brian Tardiff, Rhode Island’s chief information officer and head of the Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services (ETSS), said the state handled procurement centrally and purchased about 4,620 new devices to replace machines that couldn’t run Windows 11, an investment totalling about $3.4 million. 
No grants or federal funds were used for these purchases, and anything that didn’t need to be replaced was upgraded in place. The Windows 11 upgrades even got a shoutout from Gov. Dan McKee in his fiscal year 2025 budget, which allocated $4.8 million from the Information Processing Internal Service Fund for IT-related expenses.

Consumers have limited options
While governments have little choice in whether to upgrade, consumers are on their own. They can also squeeze a little more life out of their Windows 10 machines with Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates.
In an unsigned Oct. 9 email, a Microsoft spokesperson called these updates a “short-term bridge” while people move to Windows 11. Customers can get the extended updates for a year if they sync their PC settings with the company’s cloud service, Windows Backup, or if they redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points. The coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. 
Customers can also pay $30 for the extended support. For cities, schools and other organizations, Microsoft will charge $61 per device for the first year of extended updates. The updates can be renewed for up to three years, with price increases each year. 
On Sept. 25, Microsoft budged slightly and decided to allow consumers in the European Economic Area to receive a free year’s worth of extended updates for Windows 10, no backup required.
The push to charge U.S. consumers for continued, secure access to otherwise functional computers they own is problematic for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), an environment-focused consumer advocacy nonprofit with local affiliates in multiple states, including Rhode Island. PIRG recently estimated that roughly 40% of current Windows 10 devices won’t be able to upgrade globally. That could eventually generate 1.6 billion pounds of e-waste, in the group’s estimate. 
“We just think this is absurd from a consumer point of view,” Henry Welch, a campaign associate with PIRG’s Right to Repair, said. Welch works on PIRG campaigns primarily in Rhode Island and Maine. “We’re especially worried about the effect that the end of Windows 10 would have on consumers and the environment in general.”
The options available to Windows 10 consumers are all suboptimal, in PIRG’s view. The tough choices will largely fall upon people already using more affordable devices, PIRG says, as they might not be able to acquire new machines. 
“It’s totally possible for them to extend security updates for at least a year,” Welch said. “I mean, they’re doing it in Europe already.”
PIRG is pressing Microsoft to do the same in the U.S. The group sent a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with 590 signatories asking Microsoft to do so. While PIRG will not release the list publicly, the advocacy organization said the list includes Rhode Island signees, including James Frame, owner of South County Computers in Wakefield, who commented on the Windows 11 transition in a PIRG press release. 
“We were regularly installing it [Windows 10] on customers’ computers until less than a year ago, as we considered it more stable and tried-and-true than Windows 11,” Frame said. “If it ain’t broke, don’t outdate it.”
Welch said that when he’s campaigned in rural parts of Maine, he’s encountered many people “running, really, really older versions of Windows on older laptops.”  The “very steep hardware upgrades” needed for Windows 11 like the TPM 2.0 are part of how innovation “is leaving some of these less technologically savvy people behind,” Welch said.

Pawtucket’s Cristino said his city may purchase a handful of extended support updates for Windows 10 PCs that can’t make the move.
“You never know if Microsoft next week is gonna say, ‘Yeah, no, we’re gonna extend [the deadline] a little longer,” Cristino joked.
But Microsoft will not: “After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide security and feature updates or technical support for Windows 10,” the company’s spokesperson wrote to Rhode Island Current on Oct. 9 in an unsigned email.
The spokesperson steered customers toward trade-in and recycling programs through Microsoft and its partners for devices that can’t be upgraded, and noted the company’s goal of “becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030.” 
But PIRG predicts the waste will multiply. In its letter to Microsoft’s Nadella , the group argued, “The end of free Windows 10 support will cause widespread damage to the environment and cybersecurity,” with “hundreds of millions of devices” destined for either obsolescence or the landfill.
In the Ocean State, those items may end up with the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC), which runs the state’s Central Landfill in Johnston and also serves as a collection site for the state’s e-waste program. In 2024, the Johnston e-waste collection site logged 84,517 pounds of covered electronics, all of it destined for manufacturer-funded recycling programs. 



Do I need to upgrade my operating system?
Why should I upgrade from Windows 10 anyway? Because of their ubiquity, Windows systems have long been the biggest target for malware and other bad actors. Most malicious scripts are written for Windows, and years of backwards compatibility and the wide array of apps and drivers on Windows widen the possibilities for attack. Improvements like TPM — or Trusted Platform Module, which ensures when a system starts up that it hasn’t been tampered with — harden Windows against bad actors, but cyberthreats develop almost in lockstep with security measures. 
“Microsoft understands that moving to a new PC can take time, and there are multiple options to choose from,” the company recommended through a spokesperson. “For devices that are eligible to upgrade to Windows 11, they strongly encourage the upgrade as this will give the  highest security for the device.”

First, check to see if your Windows PC can upgrade: The PC Health Check App can quickly identify whether your Windows computer needs an upgrade. If you’re curious about the specs, Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0, UEFI/Secure Boot, and a modern CPU and RAM. If your computer was made in the last five years, it probably qualifies. You may need to turn on TPM 2.0.
If you can’t upgrade and need more time: You can enroll in Windows’ Extended Support Updates. Coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. To continue receiving updates, your options include:

Syncing your PC settings with Microsoft’s cloud service, Windows Backup, at no additional cost
Redeeming 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points
Paying $30, plus any additional taxes.

Microsoft 365 Apps get a longer runway: Desktop apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, and Publisher will get security updates on Windows 10 until Oct. 10, 2028, but the underlying OS won’t, so plan accordingly. 
I bought a new PC. What do I do with my old one? The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation website includes plenty of information, broken down by municipality, on how to recycle old computers. Microsoft also recommends trade-in and recycling programs are available through through its trusted partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, or at retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Business customers can access similar services through resellers like Bechtle, CDW, ComputaCenter, Connection, and SHI, Microsoft said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar, a case that could significantly change how states protect LGBTQIA+ youth. The issue is whether states can ban licensed mental health professionals from subjecting children to so-called “conversion therapy.”
From the questioning, most justices seem ready to strike down these bans, arguing that conversion therapists are simply engaging in protected speech with their clients.
That framing is dangerously incomplete. Licensed professionals such as therapists, doctors and lawyers are not ordinary speakers. When we earn a professional license, we also accept restrictions on our speech during practice. These restrictions exist for a reason: Words can cause serious harm when spoken with professional authority.
Supreme Court justices skeptical of free speech limits in Colorado conversion therapy case

If a doctor advises a patient to drink bleach to cure a cold, or a lawyer counsels a client to commit perjury, neither can hide behind the First Amendment. Professional speech is held to standards of competence and ethics because the stakes involve life, liberty and health.
The same holds true in mental health practice. Conversion therapy is not a harmless exchange of ideas between equals. It is based on the discredited belief that LGBTQIA+ identities are disorders to be fixed. All major medical and mental health organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have condemned conversion therapy as ineffective, unethical and harmful. These groups warn that the practice raises the risks of depression, substance abuse, family rejection and suicide. Conversion therapy is a form of psychological abuse, particularly when forced upon minors.
State regulation of professional practice is well established. States regularly define limits on what licensed professionals can and cannot do. We prevent doctors from prescribing unsafe or unproven treatments. We discipline lawyers who provide fraudulent or harmful advice.
Therapists are also required to follow standards that mandate evidence-based practices and prioritize client safety. Conversion therapy fails these standards, and states have both the right and obligation to protect children from it.
The court’s apparent willingness to prioritize the free speech rights of practitioners over the health and safety of minors overlooks that balance. The First Amendment has never been an absolute shield against professional responsibility. Treating it as such would lead to a cascade of unintended consequences. If speech alone were the standard, what would prevent a financial advisor from selling fraudulent schemes under the guise of “speech?” What would stop a physician from prescribing quack remedies with no scientific backing? Regulation of professions has always required more than blind deference to free expression.
The consequences of overturning these bans will be severe. Children themselves rarely seek conversion therapy. It is imposed on them by parents or guardians, often influenced by religious or ideological groups. These young people do not give informed consent before attending therapy. They are forced into sessions that promote shame and self-hatred. 
Research indicates that LGBTQIA+ young adults who faced high levels of family rejection are more than eight times as likely to attempt suicide compared to their peers from supportive families. Loosening state bans now would risk exploitation by professionals under the guise of constitutional liberty.
The court should avoid oversimplifying this issue as merely a conflict between free speech and censorship. The case involves professional standards, public safety, and the legitimate role of the state in preventing harm. Personal opinions belong in the public square where disagreement is protected. However, when a licensed professional advises a client, that speech is not just free expression but professional conduct with ethical duties and legal limits. Ignoring this distinction risks enabling harm and diminishes the authority of states to protect vulnerable youth.
The First Amendment deserves robust protection, but not at the expense of children’s lives. The Constitution should not be distorted into a weapon that protects malpractice.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Six years after they first squared off, Republican Del. Carrie Coyner and Democrat Lindsey Dougherty are headed for a high-stakes rematch in Virginia’s House District 75 — a once-reliably Republican seat that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and has since become one of the most closely watched battlegrounds statewide.
Coyner, a Chesterfield attorney and former school board member who won the newly drawn district by about five points in 2023, spent the last week fielding national attention tied to 2022 text messages from Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones — messages Jones sent to Coyner and later apologized for after they became public this month.
 

Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41



The episode rippled through Virginia’s statewide races and thrust Coyner, usually known for K-12 policy and housing wonkery, into a national storyline.
Dougherty, a senior research administrator at Virginia Commonwealth University and the 2019 Democratic nominee in the area’s previous configuration, is pitching herself as a kitchen-table problem solver focused on health care affordability, special education, and mental-health access — themes she says cut across Hopewell, Prince George and Chesterfield alike.
Today’s District 75 stitches together the city of Hopewell with portions of Chesterfield and Prince George counties. After the Supreme Court of Virginia redrew legislative maps in 2021, the seat’s electorate diversified and trended younger, and Democrats made gains. In 2024, Harris carried the district 52.3% to 46.2% for Republican Donald Trump, part of a broader blue swing in Chesterfield that helped make suburban seats more competitive.
Money underscores the stakes. Through late summer, the Virginia Public Access Project lists Coyner with roughly $846,580 raised this cycle and Dougherty with about $490,902.
 Carrie Coyner

A self-described education realist who came up through the Chesterfield School Board, Coyner says her legislative compass hasn’t changed since she first ran.
“My passion for public education has stayed at the forefront of all of my public service,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I originally got into public service on the school board, because I was passionate about improving the quality of education for every child, regardless of your zip code.”
On committee work, she argues Education, General Laws (Housing Subcommittee) and Appropriations are where she delivers for her district.
“Sitting on (the) education committee, (I can) be a voice about keeping us focused on our primary role, which is providing the highest quality education to kids,” she said. 
She also called herself “the lead voice on housing policies,” using 25 years in real estate law to flag well-intended bills with “unintended bad consequences.” 
In Appropriations, she said much of the work is “ahead of time behind the scenes,” adjusting proposals before costs cascade.
Coyner has been a principal architect for the Virginia Literacy Act and follow-on measures. The 2022 law shifted Virginia toward science-of-reading instruction, funded reading specialists and directed the state to support district rollouts. 
In 2024, lawmakers approved a Coyner bill tightening VLA provisions and barring three-cueing in reading curricula. “We learned from (other states) how to do it better,” she said, arguing the full benefits will phase in over several years.
Coyner also pointed to special-education work, including professional development requirements for general-education teachers working with students with disabilities, and criticized Democrats for not fully funding training “at one time.” 
On teacher retention, she opposed extending year-long substitute assignments, saying they heap burden on veteran staff; she favors recruiting retirees part-time and offering tuition assistance to math and science majors who agree to teach. 
She further touted a new guarantee that high-school students can take “passport” dual-enrollment courses for free — in person or via community colleges — to lower costs and ease staffing gaps.
Housing is Coyner’s second plank. In the interview, the Republican said she is planning to refile a proposal to create an emergency fund serving “up to 5,000 families with school-age children” to prevent displacement during the school year. “It improves educational outcomes,” she said, by keeping kids in stable classrooms. 
And on the development front, she argues a better environmental balance is possible — newer subdivisions built to modern storm-water rules shouldn’t mean clear-cut neighborhoods, and “affordable” must be understood as a sliding scale across incomes to avoid concentrating poverty.
Industrial permitting and public health remain sensitive around Hopewell, which includes 16,000 registered voters — roughly 27% of all the voters in the district. 
Coyner called manufacturing “the backbone” of the local economy — her grandparents worked in it — but stressed air and water protections and regular talks with DEQ. When the Hopewell wastewater plant spilled sewage into the James River this summer, Coyner said she “immediately got involved” in understanding what failed and how to prevent a repeat. The district is also watching an air-permit fight involving the AdvanSix chemical facility, a case that has drawn environmental-group petitions and federal review.
On abortion, with a constitutional amendment advancing on first reference this year, Coyner frames Democrats’ proposal as overly broad.
“If you look at what has been brought forward, it is the most expansive abortion bill ever brought anywhere, period,” she said, adding she hasn’t met voters backing policies like abortions “up until the moment of birth” or minors’ access “without … talk[ing] to their parents.”
The proposed constitutional amendment’s language does not draw a precise “week-limit” cut-off. Rather, it authorizes the state to regulate abortions in the third trimester only under conditions that preserve exceptions when medically necessary or when viability is lacking.
Democrats counter that their measure would largely codify existing law, protect contraception, miscarriage care and IVF, and update later-term standards under medical necessity — a fight expected to return next session before any ballot question goes to voters.
On public safety, Coyner highlighted a partnership she helped broker with the nonprofit Real Life and local police to dispatch outreach teams after shootings, defuse retaliation and connect neighbors with services. She said it has cut “gang and group-related violence” significantly, with a domestic-violence prevention push next.
Politically, Coyner’s bottom-line contrast is simple.
“For my district, I’ve got results,” she said. “My policies try to get government out of your life when you don’t need it, and to keep more money in your pockets.”
She declined hypotheticals about losing: “I’m choosing not to think that’s a possibility.”
 Lindsey Dougherty

The Democrat’s pitch starts with her résumé and her household budget. A VCU senior research administrator who manages NIH and NSF grants, Dougherty said federal turbulence affects families like hers directly.
“This is not the first, but the second time that this president’s kind of chaotic approach to governing is directly impacting my ability to provide for my family,” she said in a recent interview, recalling a COVID-era furlough from a Chesterfield County budget job in 2020. 
“Across my district, we have a lot of federally funded workers. There’s just a lot of fear and uncertainty about how families are going to survive.”
Her “north star” as a would-be lawmaker, she said, is health care accessibility and affordability. Both of her children have complex autoimmune disorders, and she described long waits for specialists followed by stress over the bills.
“Similar to what was done in 2020 to cap the cost of insulin in Virginia, we can look at other ways to cap prescription drug costs for life-giving medications,” Dougherty said. She’d lean on state insurance regulators and her budgeting background to prioritize relief in the state plan.
On mental health, Dougherty points to school-based care, homeless services and better coordination among agencies using state and federal dollars. She called the shortage of crisis beds and strain on local systems “fixable with focus,” but said the state must avoid passing along unfunded mandates.
Workforce and higher-ed access are another priority. Dougherty wants to expand pathways through community colleges and skilled-trades programs so “good-paying jobs” don’t require a four-year degree.
“We have this really great community college system that we can tap into,” she said, arguing programs should match local employers so graduates “are able to stay in the communities that they live in.”
On K-12, she speaks as a parent who fought for proper Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). 
“It took me years to get my son an IEP at all,” she said, then “an additional year and a half” to secure needed accommodations. She wants staffing boosted and the state funding formula updated — particularly for rural divisions and special education — to ease overcrowding and burnout.
Housing is where Dougherty draws a sharp contrast with her opponent, favoring stronger tenant protections and state help for first-time buyers while urging localities to diversify housing types.
“I firmly believe that we need to provide tenant rights in addition to landlord rights,” she said, adding that Chesterfield “pretty much only (builds) large houses right now” while seniors and young families need attainable options. She links affordability to wages and child-care costs: “We really just need to look at everything holistically.”
On environmental health, Dougherty says Hopewell has been “disproportionately impacted” by industry and that fines alone aren’t sufficient deterrents when air or water permits are violated. She pointed to sewage spills and air-permit disputes as reasons to pair job retention with tougher monitoring and enforcement.
“There’s no reason why we can’t find a middle ground that works for everybody,” she said.
The debate echoes a controversy unfolding in the district, where Dominion Energy’s proposal for a new natural gas–fired plant in Chesterfield has drawn sharp opposition from environmental groups and residents concerned about pollution and public health, while business leaders and some local officials defend it as vital for grid reliability and job creation. 
The project, now under state review, has become a flashpoint in Virginia’s broader struggle to balance industrial growth with climate and air-quality goals.
Dougherty also backs “commonsense gun safety,” including limits on assault-style firearms and location rules for dealers near schools.
“I’m not against the Second Amendment,” she said, “but when we have our kids dying at a disproportionate rate, we need to look at ways to just keep our communities safer.”
On the reproductive rights amendment, Dougherty said she supports enshrining protections in the constitution and frames it as clarity and stability for families and providers.
Politically, she argues the felt difference will be in day-to-day costs:
“There are very tangible ways that the General Assembly can positively impact people’s lives every day,” she said. “If I’m going to pick one key piece, it’s the affordability and accessibility of health care.”
Dougherty also jabbed Coyner’s record as too aligned with GOP leadership, saying “she shows up to community events” but doesn’t vote for the district’s needs in Richmond. Her own strategy to overcome incumbency reprises 2019 and includes relentless door-knocking, coalition building and telling her family’s story to Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
In District 75, the map, money and mood suggest a fall race decided at the margins — a test of whether Harris-district math and Democratic energy can out-organize an incumbent with a record on education policy and deep community ties. 
What’s certain is that voters in this district will hear sharply different emphases on schools, health care and housing — and conflicting diagnoses of what “affordability” means in a fast-changing suburban-industrial district along the James.

RICHMOND, Va. — Northampton and Accomack counties launched a new program in late August that will help public high school students prepare for a career in the aerospace industry.
The Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore Lab School will provide students with networking skills, portfolio development, and experiential learning opportunities as they engage in regional aerospace initiatives.
Eastern Shore Community College and Old Dominion University are the higher education partners. Chincoteague, Northampton, Arcadia and Nandua high schools are the K-12 partners.
Students can participate all four years of high school. Freshmen and sophomores take cyber, engineering and computer science classes at the high schools, and juniors and seniors take courses at ESCC.
Once the students become juniors and seniors, the program provides two options for students. Students who take the Aerospace Engineering and Explorations route will earn an associate degree and those who pursue Aerospace Technology will receive a technician certificate.
Students will also learn about engineering fundamentals, entrepreneurship and computer science skills, in addition to gaining college math and English credits. Community college students will also have the opportunity to take aerospace courses.
“It’s a very exciting opportunity for not just the students that get to experience it, but the schools and the community around it,” said Rachel White, Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore program executive director.
Virginia students are chosen by a lottery system because of legislation the state approved, according to White. The first 50 students that enter into the lottery get accepted. Extra students are added to the waitlist and their acceptance is determined by the date and time they apply. AAES will add more students to the program in January 2026 if spots are available.
The academy is at the right location, according to White. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility is on the Eastern Shore and hosts the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and the new Rocket Lab Launch Complex.

“It’s such a booming area, and the school divisions creating a pipeline for students to be able to just directly go into the field, I think, is ideal,” White said.
The launch of the academy is an incredible opportunity for Virginia, according to Gary Skeen, associate director for the Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity at Old Dominion University.
“Really Old Dominion University is creating a full K-12 STEM pipeline and really trying to position ourselves as the STEM capital of the East Coast,” Skeen said.
ODU has four college partnership lab schools and are fiscal partners with five more, according to Skeen. Faculty members help train and write the curriculums.
“The space industry is currently at a point where it’s really growing,” Skeen said. “It’s really becoming a moving part of the economy across the nation.”
Although the aerospace workforce is slated to grow in coming years, federal cuts have impacted NASA. Over 2,100 senior ranking staff employees agreed to leave NASA through federal administration efforts to trim the federal workforce, according to a July Politico report. NASA currently employs almost 18,000 civil servants, according to its website.
“We need many students pursuing careers in the aerospace industry,” said Karen Sanzo, executive director for the ODU Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity. “I think in Virginia, it is going to be a thriving industry.”
Students participating in the academy will have the chance to complete a Virginia Community College System passport program, which is a set of course blocks designed to satisfy lower-division general education requirements at state public colleges and universities.
The program opens a gateway to the future, Gov. Glenn Youngkin stated in a press release.
“These students will be immersed in Virginia’s aerospace sector and launch into careers that will shape the skies and beyond,” Youngkin stated. “Our mission since day one has been not only to prepare students for the future, but to empower them to lead it.”

(Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)Ohio reproductive rights providers and advocates are keeping an eye on federal discussions about a longtime FDA-approved drug used in medication abortion, while maintaining a resolute message in a state with constitutional protections for abortion.
The head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has indicated he wants the federal Food and Drug Administration to re-review pills used in abortion procedures for safety and effectiveness.
Mifepristone has been FDA-approved since September 2000, and the first generic version was approved in April 2019. Just last month, the FDA approved another generic form of the medication.
Patricia Zettler, a law professor at Ohio State University who studies the FDA, said the request for a new review seems unusual, and it’s also unusual considering drug companies including those that make mifepristone are required to participate in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, which the FDA uses to “help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.”
According to the FDA, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone require that the drug be prescribed by a qualified health care provider, that the patient sign a patient agreement form explaining the risks of the treatment and that the drug be distributed by a certified pharmacy.
“The mifepristone REMS programs is a closed system, meaning prescribers, pharmacies and distributors are certified or authorized and verified under the REMS prior to distribution or dispensing of the drug,” according to the FDA.
But Zettler said because of abortion rights (and anti-abortion rights) movements in individual states and moves like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s to ask for renewed scrutiny, the drug has been “getting a lot of attention.”
“Policy preferences are generally not permissible when we’re talking about drug approval,” Zettler said.

Medication abortion is typically done with a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol.
It has often been a choice for those without easy access to reproductive clinics or without reliable transportation to get to an appointment.
It’s also considered a less-invasive alternative to surgical abortion.
The newest annual abortion report from the Ohio Department of Health showed medication abortions were used in more than 13,000 abortions in the state, representing more than 46% of all reported abortions in 2024.
A total of 196 post-abortion complications were reported in the 21,829 abortions conducted in Ohio, according to state data.
No deaths were reported in 2024.
In testimony before an Ohio House committee discussing a bill related to abortion funding, Ohio State epidemiology professor Dr. Alison Norris, spoke on the effectiveness of the drug.
Norris is also a co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, a group of academic researchers who study abortion and contraception developments and impacts.
Norris told legislators during the committee hearing that more than 100 peer-reviewed studies over 25 years “create a strong scientific evidence-base to show mifepristone is safe.”
“Scientific consensus is that serious adverse events amongst users of Mifepristone occur less than 0.03% of the time,” Norris said.
Norris also pointed to research using CDC data that showed more likelihood of maternal death in childbirth than in abortion.
The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists also used the information in saying abortion is a “safe medical intervention.”
“The risk of complication or mortality from abortion is less than the same risk from common procedures like wisdom tooth removal, cancer-screening colonoscopy and plastic surgery,” the group said on its website.
The group went further to say that restricting access to abortion “forces some pregnant people to continue their pregnancies to delivery, leaving them to face the many health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth.”
Ohioans are facing the risk of restricted access to reproductive care in some areas, with the closure of southwest Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, and staffing reductions in the Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio clinics, which the facilities said were due to cuts to federal Medicaid funding and other federal resources.
Despite the closures and workforce limitations, Ohio clinics have encouraged clients to use telehealth for care (abortion and otherwise).
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced a plan to expand medication abortion services in Mansfield in September.
“Medication abortion is a safe and effective option for ending a pregnancy,” said Dr. Bhavik Kuma, chief medical officer for the greater Ohio affiliate, in a statement.
“Planned Parenthood will always follow evidence-informed standards and medical best practices to provide safe, high-quality abortion care and information to patients who come to us.”
Even with a request from the HHS secretary to once again review the medication abortion drug, the process is time-consuming, according to Zettler.
It would include reviewing evidence, assessing whether a different determination can be made about the drug, and about whether the benefits outweigh the risks, she said.
“So, the most important takeaway from this for states is that nothing has changed,” Zettler said. “Nothing’s going to change tomorrow and nothing’s changed today.”

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderA unique off-year election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, a body responsible for regulating utilities in the state, has Republicans vocally concerned, especially considering concurrent municipal elections that they worry could favor Democratic mobilization.
District 3 Public Service Commissioner Fitz Johnson. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Early voting starts Tuesday for the Nov. 4 election, which will decide the fate of two incumbent Republican commissioners on the PSC — Tim Echols of District 2 and Fitz Johnson of District 3 — who are being challenged by Democratic candidates Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard, respectively. Fitz Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021. 
With the races operating outside the typical presidential or midterm election cycles, attention is low and local municipal races could inadvertently dictate the outcome of the statewide PSC contests, according to experts. 
Democrats are also hoping frustration over rising electricity bills will help motivate voters to turn out, with both Democratic candidates campaigning on utility affordability. 
Republicans appear to be ramping up efforts to energize their base. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp recently headlined a campaign event in Cumming for the Republican incumbents. Signs at the event said “Don’t Dem the lights in Georgia.” 
Josh McKoon, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said there was significant concern about Republican voter engagement in the PSC races. He said this election is important for two reasons: the PSC’s role in ensuring reliable energy, which is the “backbone” of Georgia’s economy, and the need to prevent the Democratic Party from gaining a “crack in the door” to the state’s governance.
“We have got to wake people up,” he said.

McKoon encouraged early voting, saying that “the more early voting we have, the easier it’s going to be to finish the drill and win this election.” He described the election as a “close election” in a “competitive state.” 
At the top of his speech, Kemp signaled his concerns about low Republican turnout and suggested that apprehension over the coming election drove first lady Marty Kemp to start wearing a shirt with the word “pray” on it. 
“You hardly even see (Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson) out there shaking any hands, asking anybody for a vote. They’re hoping nobody pays attention to this race. They don’t even want people to know that there is a race. That is our biggest liability in this race, as a lot of the speakers have talked about, is that people just don’t know what’s going on,” Kemp said.
Echols, who has served on the commission since 2011, acknowledged that Democrats have an advantage due to the numerous municipal elections taking place and, along with other speakers, pivoted to campaigning on cultural issues. He called his opponent, Alicia Johnson, a “DEI specialist” who “wants to bring DEI principles into health care companies, and now she wants to do that at the Public Service Commission.”

“She wants to bring DEI and wokeness to the PSC. We simply can’t let that happen, can we?” Echols said.
Alicia Johnson, the Democratic candidate for District 2, addressed the attack directly, calling the comments not just a “lie,” but a “racist, MAGA dog-whistle,” saying that her background is at the “intersection of community development, economic development and public policy.” She added that she believes the attack is a sign that the incumbents “are scared.”

“I think it really speaks to Tim Echols’ character and his personal values, and that it’s a reflection of him, not me,” Alicia Johnson said. “I’m not just a Black female, but I’m a wife, I’m a mother, I’m a grandmother, I’m a community leader. If he wants to point out that I’ve dedicated my career to helping people, communities and organizations grow stronger and healthier and more resilient, then way to go, Tim.”
Other speakers also resorted to culture war attacks, with Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor, claiming that the “Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists.” Congressman Mike Collins, a U.S. Senate candidate, said that allowing the two Democrats to be elected would bring back “that green new scam of Joe Biden’s America” along with “California values of less power, more brownouts and higher energy.”
But despite Republicans’ concerns about reaching voters, Hubbard was the only candidate who participated in a recent debate hosted by the Atlanta Press Club. Hubbard, who debated against an empty podium as Fitz Johnson declined to participate, used the absence of his opponent to launch a direct attack on the incumbent’s record.
“My question would be, why didn’t you have the courage to show up today and defend your six rate hikes in two years?” Hubbard asked.
Echols and his opponent, Alicia Johnson, also did not participate in the debate.

The role of municipal elections
Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said in an interview that because Georgia still leans conservative, Republicans, who are also incumbents, have a slight advantage. However, he pointed to the general low visibility of PSC races, saying that voters typically don’t know who the candidates are or what the PSC does. Voters in this case are likely to show up to vote for local candidates they know and “tend to fall back on party ID,” Bullock said.
“That’s the kind of situation which therefore may create the opening where Democrats could break through and win one or both of these,” Bullock said.
Democrats are pledging to be a check on rising utility bills. The current commission has come under scrutiny for approving a series of rate increases requested by Georgia Power. 
Bullock and fellow UGA political science professor Trey Hood emphasized that the simultaneous municipal elections in cities, typically where Democrats live and contested races are common, can provide a stronger incentive for voters to show up at the polls.
“I think the argument about Democrats being somewhat advantaged because of these local elections is probably more correct, or probably has more weight,” Hood said, compared to the argument about voters being dissatisfied with rising energy bills.
Bullock said if Democrats were to win either or both seats, “this would be quite inspiring and exciting for them” as they head into next year’s elections, because they may see it as conditions trending in their favor. He said that even if both Republican incumbents win, Democrats could still interpret results as an advantage heading into 2026, where most statewide seats will not have a Republican incumbent running, potentially opening the door for more competitive contests.
Voter frustration over utility bills
Democrats and energy advocates are banking on voter frustration over rising utility bills helping to energize voters.
Charles Hua of PowerLines, an organization focusing on consumer energy issues, said in an interview that nationally, utility bills are the “fastest driver of inflation right now,” adding that utility bills in Georgia “have increased 33% in the last two years, translating to about $500 per year.”
Hua said that utility affordability is a “very animating issue right now” and could mobilize voters, but that the challenge is that the awareness of the PSC’s role is not high. Most state agencies across the U.S. that regulate utilities are appointed, unlike in Georgia, where voters can choose each of the five commissioners.
“We’re in the homestretch 27 days. What’s possible? Look, I don’t know. We don’t know. We’re going to see this play out … We don’t know what the final turnout number will be because this is the only statewide election you know on the ballot, and most people have not heard of it,” Hua said.
Connie Di Cicco, political director for Georgia Conservation Voters, an organization focused on environmental protection advocacy, said the frustration is “almost palpable at this point,” and that she believes that the direct connection between the PSC and bills is a strong mobilizing issue.
“Affordability is just a universal issue that a lot of people are feeling all over the state, and that is something that people are very upset about, and literally hits home. So if you’re feeling it and you don’t like it, then you can vote for change and make something happen in November,” Di Cicco said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06614-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

A new law passed by California legislators creates a pathway to establish a regional market for managing the flow of energy throughout the West. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.
The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.
With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.
But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.
“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”
The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.
But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.
A bigger market
Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.
States Reimagine Power Grids for Wind and Solar Future

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.
Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.
Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.
As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.
“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”
Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.
“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”
Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.










We’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris


But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.
“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”
Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.
“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”
Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.
A new market
The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.
The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.
“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.
State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.
“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”
Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.
“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”
The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.
Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.
While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.
State sovereignty
The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.
“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”
Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.
“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”
Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.
Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.
“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”
Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.
Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.
“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”
Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.
“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”

(Photo by K. Stoll/National Park Service)For more than 70 years, the American chestnut tree has, mostly, been absent from the landscape. But historical accounts of its grandeur and the tons of nutritious seeds it produced every fall have made it loom large in New England’s forest memory.
Now, as another tree disappears — the ash — scientists working in the White Mountains of New Hampshire hope they can document its demise to gain a new, deeper understanding of how species losses ripple through ecosystems.
When most American chestnuts were killed by chestnut blight in the first half of the 20th century, the loss of the species was felt both culturally and ecologically. The trees were among the largest in the forest, reaching heights of more than 100 feet. Scientists know the species took with it an autumnal chestnut crop that was nutritious for people and wildlife alike. They also suspect that the die-off disrupted tree-specific communities of insects and soil microbes. But regarding what those communities looked like, and to what extent their loss rippled through the forest ecosystem, they can only make educated guesses.
“More or less, the species has been deleted from the landscape,” said UNH professor Jeff Garnas, who studies forest ecosystems and health in the Northeast. “… That happened 100 years ago, and we really have very little ecological understanding of what the consequences of the loss of (American chestnut) are,” he said.
Now, Garnas and the other researchers working on the Ash Protection Experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, hope they will be able to shed light on the effects of tree loss events by studying another as it unfolds.
Ash trees, members of the Fraxinus genus, are vanishing from forests across the Northeast, Midwest, and parts of the South as they fall victim to the invasive emerald ash borer. When the beetle infests an ash, the tree typically dies within three to five years. The emerald ash borer has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees across North America since it arrived, likely during the 1990s, according to Southern Forest Health. 
The emerald ash borer was first detected in New Hampshire in 2013 and has since made it to every county in the state. The future looks grim for ash in North America, Garnas said. And at Hubbard Brook, where the ash borer was first detected in July 2021, scientists are beginning to see trees dying off as it takes hold.
“As unfortunate as it is, the emerald ash borer stands to delete another, in this case, genus of trees … from our forests,” he said. “And so we wanted to take the opportunity to ask questions about the fundamental feedback between the tree species and associated biodiversity and ecosystem function.”
That feedback includes many relationships among forest organisms, from the microbes and fungi in the soil to plants and insects living beneath the tree canopy — all of which are shaped by trees. The ash tree protection experiment will allow scientists to track the impacts of ash borer on those communities and relationships, Garnas said. And while the exact impacts of the American chestnut’s decline all those years ago will remain a mystery, Garnas hopes the findings of this experiment will, among other things, help scientists get a better idea of what they may have looked like.
The experimental setup includes dozens of forested research plots in Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, each with seven to 15 “large, mature ash” trees, Garnas said. Ash trees in half of the plots were injected with a powerful insecticide at the outset of the study — which began in a flurry right after the invasive beetles were found at Hubbard Brook in 2021, he added.
The insecticide, emamectin benzoate, is derived from a compound produced by soil microbes. An injection can protect a tree for three to four years, Garnas said. However, he said, though the treatment has worked to protect trees from the emerald ash borer in the context of this experiment, it’s not a solution for ash loss more broadly. 
“At a forest scale, you know, it’s really not going to be feasible to fight this invasion with chemical pesticides. … It’s more of a spot treatment,” he said.
By preserving the trees involved in the study, the Ash Protection Experiment may provide a system to study ash for years to come, even when others of their kind have long since died, Garnas said. Researchers elsewhere use the pesticide to preserve some ash trees as seed stock. The conservationists who undertake this work, Garnas said, hope the emerald ash borer will eventually be vanquished, or at least managed.
“With the hope that some of the other management tools will come to fruition and be, you know, as effective as they can be, people are sort of anticipating being able to at least keep some ash in the forest so that it’s there for when it can thrive again,” Garnas said. “You know, whether that’s 10 years or 100 years off – It’s hard to say at the moment.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emeraldashborernps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

Now, serving as the executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, the 41 year old said she is blown away by the breadth of people engaged with the issue. 
She shared these reflections with Maine Morning Star in light of the alliance’s third celebration of “Nihkaniyane: Let’s Go Forward Together” last week, when members and allies came together to recognize the coalition’s work and the relationships that make it possible. 
Noting the current political instability in the United States, Bryant said it is a precarious time for tribal rights, “but also, I see a lot of people turning to us and asking what they can do and I think that a lot of people want to work in their one little corner of the world.”
Since its founding in 2020, the Wabanaki Alliance has expanded, physically — with a coalition of more than 300 organizations across Maine and the addition of staff members — but also in the reach of its cause.

The Wabanaki Alliance was formed to advocate for changes to the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. That land agreement has resulted in the Wabanaki Nations — the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation — being treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations. 
Since the organization’s creation, progress has been made. For example, the state expanded tribal authority to prosecute crimes. But Gov. Janet Mills vetoed the latest proposed change this year, bipartisan legislation that would have prevented the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. Mills has rejected sweeping reform and instead approached changing the relationship on a case-by-case basis. 
Though, already fairly widespread gubernatorial candidate support for tribal sovereignty suggests the state’s approach could change when Mills is termed out in 2026.

“I think it’s hard for tribal people sometimes to be widely accepted in the state,” Bryant said. “It’s such a weird line to walk sometimes, of being set in your stances of tribal sovereignty and having people accept you. There’s few people that do that very well.” 
One of those people, she said, is John Banks, a citizen of the Penobscot Nation who has dedicated his life to environmental stewardship. 
Banks, one of the Nihkaniyane honorees, was the longest serving member of the Maine-Indian State Tribal Commission, which is tasked with continually reviewing the effectiveness of the Settlement Act as well as the relationship between the Wabanaki Nations and state. He was also the first natural resources director for the Penobscot Nation, a role he served in for 41 years until his retirement in 2021.
Banks received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Natural Resources Council of Maine in 2021 and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2019. 
One of his many contributions to the protection of natural resources was his role in the Penobscot River Restoration Project that was completed in 2016. The project, which removed two dams and created a bypass around a third to open nearly 2,000 miles of habitat, led to millions of river herring, Atlantic salmon and other species returning in numbers not seen for two centuries.
Laura Rose Day, executive director of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust, has credited Banks with saving the negotiations between environmental groups and the hydro company to allow the project to move forward. She said Banks reminded everyone of the concept of “all my relations,” the Indigenous idea that everything is interconnected, in explaining the shared responsibility for the river.
Banks and the two other honorees this year represent the passing on of generational wisdom in several respects.

Brianne Lolar, the Wabanaki Studies specialist for the Maine Department of Education, is a former teacher who has been working to help other educators include Wabanaki studies in their curricula. While it has been required teaching under state law since 2001, a 2022 report found it had not been meaningfully implemented across the state.
The author of that 2001 law, Donna Loring, suggested Lolar as an honoree, which Bryant said speaks volumes about how everyone is in this work together. 
“Instead of feeling any kind of complicated feelings about it not landing perfectly or being supported, she wants to really push forward Brie’s work,” Bryant said of Loring, who formerly served as Mills’ senior advisor on tribal affairs and on behalf of Penobscot Nation as a nonvoting member of the Maine Legislature, among other positions. 
The Legislature has attempted several times to pass a new law to allocate resources to ensure that this required curriculum is adequately taught, however such efforts have so far failed. The latest bill that sought to do this wasn’t funded last session and is being carried over to the coming year for further consideration. 
When talking about Passamoquoddy citizen Emma Soctomah, who is being honored for her academic achievements, Bryant highlighted the foundation for change laid by her father, Donald Soctomah.
As a state representative for the Passamaqoddy Tribe, he got a law passed to remove the sq-slur from place names in Maine. That was the first bill Bryant had ever testified on as a teenager, so she also personally credits Soctomah for sparking her desire to fight for legislative change. 
(Similar to the implementation of the Wabanaki studies law, there are continuing efforts to rectify noncompliance with Maine laws prohibiting racial slurs in the names of municipalities and other landmarks. But earlier this year a senator withdrew a bill that sought to do that because of the current political realities at the federal level.)

Soctomah’s mother, Elizabeth Neptune, is also a prominent name in public health work, having served for more than 13 years as director of health and human services for the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.
So Emma Soctomah, too, exemplifies the kind of generational echoes seen between Loring and Lolar, Bryant said. 
“I’m familiar with the work of her parents,” Bryant said, “and then she gets to step in, educate, learn and be an example.”
This year, Soctomah was the valedictorian at the University of Maine at Machias. 
“My late grandmother always said the proudest moment of her life was when her children and grandchildren were to graduate,” Soctomah said in her valedictorian address. “I never truly understood why that was the case until fairly recently. Of course, she was happy to see us succeed but the pride went deeper than that. It comes from the obstacles that we, as Indigenous peoples, have to overcome.”
One in seven people in her Passamaquoddy community graduate with a bachelor’s degree, she said, compared to one in three people for the overall population.

Once the third-largest pharmacy chain in the United States, Rite Aid announced on its website that all of its stores are now closed. 
Health Care Dive reported the development on Oct.6. At the time of the closures, the chain was still operating more than 1,200 stores despite two bankruptcies, the news organization reported. 
“All Rite Aid stores have now closed,” the company’s website says. “We thank our loyal customers for their many years of support.”

Above the statement are buttons for now-former patrons to request their records and to find their new pharmacy if those records have been automatically transferred.
The closures are the latest blow to pharmacy access after years of complaints by independent and small-chain pharmacies. They have long claimed that middlemen owned by Fortune 15 health conglomerates have made their businesses unsustainable by sucking out all the profits.
Known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, the businesses decide which drugs are covered, negotiate non-transparent rebates with drugmakers, and decide how much to reimburse the pharmacies that had purchased and dispensed the drugs.
The three biggest PBMs control access to nearly 80% of patients. Their owners — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — also own top-ten insurers and pharmacies of their own. In other words, they decide how much to reimburse themselves as well as their competitors.
Critics say the system is rife with conflicts, and the Federal Trade Commission in January accused them of wild price hikes and possibly steering business to their own companies.
Big chains such as Rite Aid and Walgreens also are facing heavy competition from online retailers such as Amazon for business in front of the pharmacy counter. 
In June 2024, during its first bankruptcy, Rite Aid announced that it would close hundreds of stores in Ohio and Michigan. Ohio Board of Pharmacy spokesman Cameron McNamee said that as of Wednesday, Rite Aid had no active licenses in Ohio.

The company’s former stores join a host of others closing up in Ohio. 
When the board of pharmacy earlier this year unveiled a new tool to track closures, it revealed a sobering trend. Despite modest population growth, the number of pharmacies in the Buckeye State had dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory. 
The creation of pharmacy deserts — places where none is close by — are particularly hard and the poor and the elderly, and others for whom transportation is limited. 
It doesn’t only make it harder for those people to get their medicine. They also lose access to the one medical professional they can talk regularly to about chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

This is the tenth year of the report, which the Ohio Domestic Violence Network compiles using statistics from media reports of intimate partner relationship fatalities. 
Ohio fatalities in the last 10 years: 

157 in 2025 
114 in 2024 
112 in 2023

Of this year’s fatalities, 95 were victims and 62 were perpetrators. There were 75 female fatalities and 82 male fatalities. 84% of all fatalities were a result of gun violence. 144 people were shot in 108 cases and only 12 people survived. 56% of the primary victims killed were people of color. 
Slightly more than half (55%) of perpetrators had a criminal history and 37% included felonies. 16% of perpetrators had a history of stalking and 12% of perpetrators had a history of strangulation. 
Eleven cases required SWAT responses and one Amber Alert was issued. One police officer was shot and survived. Another law enforcement officer was shot and killed responding to an intimate partner violence call. 
The youngest victim in the report was four months old and the oldest victim was 89 years old. Eleven children were killed — four were murdered by a parent and two were killed by their mothers’ boyfriend. 36 children saw a parent’s murder. 
Three teenage girls were murdered by teenage boyfriends and three pregnant women were killed by their babies’ fathers, according to the report. 
The relationship was ending or had ended in at least 35% of all cases. 40 cases involved a murder-suicide and four were attempted murder-suicide. 
All surviving perpetrators have been charged, according to the report. 
Intimate partner violence fatalities happened in 36 of Ohio’s 88 counties in 2025. Franklin County had the most with 33, followed by Cuyahoga County with 20.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Kansans often think of themselves as a rural people. Take the two of us, for example. We’re both lifelong Kansans who grew up in farming families, one in central Kansas, the other in northwestern Kansas, in the 1950s and 1960s.
Today, we both live in Lawrence.
Kansans are no longer a rural people. Almost half of the state’s population lives in just five of the state’s 105 counties: Johnson, Douglas, Shawnee, Wyandotte, and Sedgwick. Nearly one-fourth of the population lives in Johnson County alone. And the number of urban residents continues to grow.
That’s just one reason that the state’s public lands — our local, state, and federal parks and monuments — matter so much. Kansas ranks near the bottom in per capita public property.
Not only does Kansas have relatively small amount of park land, much of it is remote from the state’s population centers. The state’s largest parcel of publicly accessible property is the Cimarron National Grassland in Morton County in extreme southwestern Kansas. Many Kansans have never been there, maybe in part because the grassland is closer to the state capitals of Colorado, Oklahoma, and even New Mexico than it is to Topeka.
For an increasingly urban population, our state and federal parks are increasingly important. They are a way for people to know and enjoy the natural world. Plants and animals need these places too. With the threats of habitat fragmentation and climate change, these islands of the natural world are critical. Cranes and migratory shorebirds rely on Quivira National Wildlife Refuge and Cheyenne Bottoms in central Kansas. Because so many wetlands in this central flyway have been plowed up, those that remain are essential. These places also provide the public with places to watch birds, a growing pastime that generates its own economic benefit to local communities.
The love of these locations cuts across party lines. Poll after poll shows strong support for national parks. And people don’t just say it, they vote with their feet. National park visits hit 330 million in 2024.
That same support is evident on the local and state level.
For years, people asked us about the best places to see the Kansas chalk beds. But virtually all of these famous, scenic outcrops are on private property. In 2019, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the Kansas chapter of The Nature Conservancy opened Little Jerusalem, a 330-acre park in the chalk badlands of Logan County, south of Oakley.
Since its opening, Little Jerusalem has attracted thousands of visitors from across the country who hike the badlands, see prairie birds and plants, and ponder fossils on what was an ancient sea floor.
In short, our local, state, and federal parks are more popular and valuable than ever. They are also under threat. There are moves in Congress to sell federal lands. Staffing at the National Park Service has been cut. On the state level, park funding is regularly challenged, even though much of the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks budget is funded by permits and fees.
That’s why public support for local, state, and federal public property is crucial. On the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (proceeds from offshore drilling royalties) provides millions of dollars to Kansas for public properties.
On the state level, a coalition of more than 40 conservation organizations, from the Farm Bureau to Audubon of Kansas, have formed Kansans for Conservation. They’ve proposed long-term, dedicated funding for conservation projects across the state.
Elected officials should understand the widespread support for efforts like the LWCF fund. The proposal from Kansans for Conservation deserves serious consideration.
The two of us have been lucky. We’ve watched ferruginous hawks soar over Little Jerusalem. We’ve seen blue pitcher sage bloom on the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. We’ve contemplated history at the Pawnee Indian Village Museum in Republic County and the military cemetery at Fort Scott.
If the public and elected officials stand up for them now, these places will be around for future generations of Kansans, no matter where they live.
Will Rogers once said, “Sanity is where you find it.” Many of us find it on public lands. We need these places. Now they need us.

Enrollment at most Ohio public universities is up, but international enrollment is down

Wright State University had the most modest decline in enrollment, losing 4.3% of its international students. 
Bowling Green University and Cleveland State University, had the largest relative losses, each losing about a third of their international student enrollment.
Enrolling international students brings benefits to the state of Ohio. 
International students usually pay “sticker price,” meaning the entirety of their tuition tends to go toward supporting the state system and providing education for other students. 
International students also bring new perspectives to the classroom and student organizations, helping enhance the learning experience of students from Ohio and out-of-state students who may live in Ohio after college. 
International students who come to Ohio for school are also more likely to stay in Ohio afterwards, helping to counteract Ohio’s “brain drain” problem by bringing qualified people from abroad to bolster Ohio’s workforce.
While national-level headwinds are hard to overcome, Ohio has some tools in its belt to attract international students.

Ohio could create a statewide tuition and internship initiative. This could use funds to create modest reductions in tuition in priority fields: think engineering, data science, and health. 
This could be paired with an internship program where universities work with Ohio employers to hire international students and keep them on after graduation. 
This could help bring in international students targeted towards filling holes in Ohio’s workforce, which would lead to higher earnings and more job creation in the state in the long run.
The state could also market its universities as a single destination, rather than 14 universities under different brands. 
Ohio has amenities that should make the state an attractive destination for international students: affordable cities, safety, and job opportunities in lucrative fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, and technology. 
Making Ohio’s offering clear could lead to, for instance, Miami University losing more international students to places like Ohio University and less places like Michigan State.
The state could invest in reducing bureaucratic friction for international students. 
Standardized driver’s license or state ID rules could make it easier for international students to get identification that can connect them to other amenities in the state. 
Statewide welcome centers at airports could give new international students a place to begin as they arrive in the state. 
And providing legal and visa services across universities, the system could help support international students in dealing with an increasingly fickle federal Department of State.
Finally, the state can try to help students stay in Ohio after they graduate. 
An H1-B bridge program with universities as sponsoring partners could help students transition into the working world. 
Requiring JobsOhio to count international talent retention as a key performance metric could also encourage companies to retain international students in the state.
International students bring vibrancy, talent, and economic vitality to the state of Ohio. 
For Ohio to stay competitive in a global economy, it needs to have a global workforce. Steps like this could help it do just that.

Seriously? Evnen is okay — as is state Attorney General Mike Hilgers […],"Voters fill out ballots in the Nebraska Union at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)The Big Lie is the stinker that keeps polluting the political atmosphere.
The latest iteration of its malodorous effect is Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen admitting that sending voter registration data to the U.S. Department of Justice is all right with him. Seriously? Evnen is okay — as is state Attorney General Mike Hilgers — with the DOJ having our birth dates, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of our Social Security numbers? I’ve ordered widgets online without disclosing that much info. 
To be fair, the feds already have our SSNs, and some other personal details might be appropriate for ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which helps states share data to keep voter rolls accurate and up to date.
But the DOJ? Apparently it needs the data to continue the Sisyphean sham that the 2020 presidential election was suspect. The miasma from that fractured fairytale of a crisis in our election integrity has since befouled the public discourse. The crisis took a hiatus during the 2024 general election. 
Here are some ideas: Let it go. Clear the air. Move on.
Nevertheless, the Big Lie’s coattail is Evnen’s rationale for sending our details to Washington — which, as of this writing, is blocked by a lawsuit. He maintains, without evidence, that Nebraska’s electoral house is in order but that other states might be letting non-citizens vote in numbers enough to swing an election. Sending our state’s voters’ private registration information to the DOJ, because we believe a lie that has been nothing but a lie since its inception makes little sense. 
When you register to vote, your name and address become part of a public record, available to whomever would want them although a fee is charged for access. To his credit, Evnen said he wants to know how secure the data would be and how it would be used. Gee, you think? Especially given our recent descent into data hell with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) coders.
The Big Lie remains just that, but its consequences have reshaped and to some extent hollowed out part of our democracy by eroding trust. In Nebraska, you can draw a straight line from the Big Lie to why we now present photo IDs to vote, despite no evidence that Nebraska ballot boxes were ever stuffed with unsavory Xs. 
While you have your pencil out, draw the same line to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the nation’s Capitol and the near-miss of having a free and fair election overturned. Nor was Nebraska alone in its wont to change its voting process without evidence a change was necessary. 
In 2021 alone, according to the Brennan Center for Justice,, 19 states enacted 34 restrictive laws that made casting a ballot harder than before. The Big Lie did more than call into question our elections without substantiation, it contributed to a growing distrust in the nation’s institutions. 
Your pencil should also connect to conspiracy theories, which add to this erosion of faith and are amplified by the exponential power of social media. We’re left with a sludge in which we can’t even agree on the facts, let alone something that approaches the truth. 
Unless you’ve been vacationing on a distant planet, you are also aware — or should be — that lying, from fibs to pants-on-fire fabrications, has become commonplace. If you’re an average American, you’re telling a whopper or at least a lie of some size about 11 times a week, according to research from the American Psychological Association. Some liars can’t seem to help themselves. According to the Journal of Social Psychology, more than half of us tell a lie three times within a 10-minute conversation. Yikes.
Those numbers seem high to me, but perhaps you know a compulsive liar  who skews the data. I’m not sure if it’s a compulsion, but I can think of a group — and where they work — who make stuff up as they go along. Maybe you can, too.
Perhaps of greater concern is our too often inability to ferret out a plain lie, challenge an incredulous assertion or believe a notion offered without relevant evidence. The same whitecoats disaggregating the numbers a couple paragraphs above might argue that we do that for a number of reasons, not the least of which is “confirmation bias,” believing what supports what we already believe.
All of which makes sense if you’re a scientist. But let’s not give the private data of Nebraska voters to the DOJ based on something that is simply not true.

Rescue and recovery efforts began Sunday in western Alaska as a major storm caused by remnants of Typhoon Halong hit coastal communities with massive storm surge, flooding and hurricane-force winds up to 100 mph. 
The storm bore down on the lower Kuskokwim River delta region early Sunday morning with the most significant damage reported in Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, and Napakiak. 
The U.S. Coast Guard and Alaska Air National Guard, and Alaska Army National Guard dispatched rescue aircraft to conduct search and rescue efforts, and begin delivering needed supplies. 
There were no serious injuries or deaths reported as of Sunday afternoon, according to the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. 
“Search and rescue is the priority at this time,” said division spokesperson Jeremy Zidek by email. He said rescue teams searched the multiple homes that were torn up and floating in nearby waters. 
On Sunday, the Alaska State Troopers reported at least 18 people were rescued in Kwigillingok and at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy extended a disaster declaration first issued on Oct. 8 to coordinate disaster response and recovery resources for communities in the Yupitt, Pribilof Island and Lower Kuskokwim Regional Education Attendance Areas. 
“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Dunleavy said. 
Representatives of coastal villages reported on an afternoon call hosted by the nonprofit Association of Village Council Presidents that residents were sheltering in place, many in local schools, and were assessing the damage. 
The storm caused major erosion, damaging boardwalks, roads and bridges. It sank boats and damaged homes with high winds. Some homes were blown off foundations and turned over. Some communities reported power outages and a loss of cell service, and were relying on backup generators and Starlink satellites for wifi connection. 
Zidek said that there were no emergency evacuations, but the Alaska National Guard’s Bethel Readiness Center was equipped with a 100-bed shelter to receive evacuees if necessary.

Winds gusted up to 100 miles per hour in Tooksook Bay, 91 mph in St George Island, and up to 76 mph in Bethel and St Mary’s, according to the National Weather Service Alaska Region. 
Coastal flood warnings are still in effect for the Kuskokwim Delta coast, Nunivak Island, St. Lawrence Island and to the northwest coast, and there are coastal flood advisories for the western and central Arctic coast.

(Photo by Getty Images)In New York, they brag about Broadway and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
In Chicago, it’s Millennium Park and Frank Lloyd Wright buildings.
Arizona has the Grand Canyon; Colorado has the Rockies; New Mexico has Area 51.
Very nice, I’m sure.
Still, none of them can hold a chlorine-scented candle to Florida, home of the Waste Pro Garbage Truck Museum; the Bike-Riding Parrots of Sarasota Jungle Gardens; Big Betsy, Islamorada’s 30-foot high spiny lobster; not to mention the Beach Tomb of Morris the Cat in Gulfport or any of our other awesome contributions to culture.
Nobody’s ever seen anything like them.
But our state will soon have an even more important attraction.
Lordly. Majestic. Certain to be clad in 24 karat gold.
I speak, naturally, of the Trump Presidential Library Hotel and Massage Parlor soon to be built in Miami.
Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.
Miami Dade College had some land sitting there on its Wolfson campus and, instead of doing something stupid with it like make a park or a cultural center or housing for students or whatever, MDC’s Board of Trustees voted to give the land — worth a paltry $200-300 million — to the state.
They voted in secret, with no public comment and no community input, but who could possibly object to such a stable genius project?
The state will, in turn, give it to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation, which means the place will be controlled by the Trump family.
“President Trump has a great story to tell as a Florida resident,” says state Attorney General and swashbuckling scofflaw James Uthmeier. “I think it’s quite fitting that we house it … as Miami becomes kind of the capital of the world in many respects.”
New York, Mumbai, Beijing, London, Paris — y’all just shut up.
Suggestions that Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet members may aspire to higher office in the near future, and know they’d be wise to court Donald Trump’s favor, are unfair.
AG Uthmeier has just been endorsed by the president, but that’s because he’s the greatest. Nobody’s ever seen anybody like him.
Trump DNA
Second Son Eric Trump posted on social media (where woke rules of grammar, punctuation, syntax, and other boring so-called aspects of “English usage” totally do not apply): “Consistent with our families DNA, this will be one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, an icon on the Miami skyline.”
As we all know, Eric Trump is a brilliant and totally ethical businessman, and the Trumps have the most exquisite taste. Just look at what his father has done with the Oval Office.
Who knew you could get such gorgeous carved onlays from Home Depot!
It is true the parcel of land is a bit small, only 2.63 acres, especially compared to Lyndon Johnson’s 30 acres in Austin, Texas, or the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library’s 37 acres.
So what? Size does not matter and small can be beautiful: Look at the president’s hands!
You build tall, tall like the president himself, who is at least six-foot five. Maybe six.
How about 100 stories? That will beat the Panorama Tower, which everybody knows is not that beautiful.
The science nerds and climate change alarmists will tell you that since average elevation in Miami is two yards above sea level, and the site is pretty much on Biscayne Bay and about 300 feet from the Miami River, there’s a big danger of flooding.
Also, hurricanes.
No big deal. They can put the “library” part of the library lower down — that’s just books and paper and stuff — and the hotel and massage parlor — the important parts — on higher floors.
It’ll be a glittering palace on Biscayne, visible from space!
Just kidding about letting it flood. We’ll want to protect the priceless artifacts of America’s Golden Age.
Treasures such as the president’s collection of photo-shopped Time Magazine covers, the famous shoe with the piece of toilet paper stuck to the bottom of it, his hurricane-bending sharpies, his special copy of the Epstein “Birthday Book,” his diamond-studded ketchup bottle, and that world-famous 20-foot red necktie.
Sure, there are nay-sayers, carpers, whiners, complainers, boo-birds, and other losers making noise.
Miami Dade College President Emeritus Eduardo Padrón, a guy who obviously doesn’t understand the great honor being accorded MDC, says it’s “frankly unimaginable” this decision was made “without any real discussion of the consequences of what that will do to the college.”
A bunch of busybody pollsters have found that 74% of Miami-Dade residents want the college to keep the land.
Dr. Marvin Dunn, a professor of psychology at FIU, has filed a lawsuit on the ground that Miami Dade College state violated Florida’s Sunshine laws.
The suit claims the public notice posted by the MDC board did not say they would talk about giving away taxpayer-funded property, but just said they’d “discuss potential real estate transactions.”
Picky, picky, picky.
That Dunn guy is such a troublemaker, always going around telling people about Black history and whatnot, just to make them sad.
Now you’ve got a bunch of fuss bunnies banging on about how the Trump library/hotel/massage parlor site is next to Miami’s Freedom Tower, which some of those never-satisfied Cubans see as sacred or something.
‘Ellis Island of the South’
Yeah, it’s the “Ellis Island of the South,” the place Cubans who ran from the communists in 1959 went to get papers and medical care, learn English, and receive help settling in Miami, where they began taking over, speaking a foreign language, insisting white people eat Ropa Vieja and drink good coffee, and attacking the integrity of American tooth enamel with their lethal Tres Leches cakes.
Some of them actually protested on the future site of what Eric Trump so rightly calls “the greatest Presidential Library ever built, honoring the greatest President our Nation has ever known.”
Tessa Petit, who runs some wild lib outfit called the Florida Immigrant Coalition, says “it’s ridiculous they’re putting a library of someone who represents everything that is contrary to freedom, someone who’s making it his mission to destroy immigrant families, next to the Freedom Tower.”
One woman, whose family left Cuba in the early 1960s, said she’s against it because the president has “a track record of destroying civic engagement and only supporting those world views that are in alignment with his own.”
Another Cuban-born radical named Yousi Mazpule, a Miami Dade College professor, calls it “a slap in the face,” telling WLRN she objects to the library/tower/massage parlor “being put right next to the Freedom Tower where so many Cubans ran from a dictator.”
That’s gratitude for you — after all the president has done for Cubans!
A bunch of them are currently getting free room and board in federal detention centers.
The Trump administration has revoked so-called “temporary humanitarian parole” for about 300,000.
Our dedicated Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem explains that Cuba, like Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Haiti, and Venezuela, are now perfectly safe, really nice places that probably have great malls.
Yes, the Cubans used to be welcome as refugees from communism, but that was before Kristi Noem was born, so she’s never heard about it and it doesn’t matter.
Now they qualify for a free trip home to Havana and, if ICE won’t let them take their small children or spouses, and they have to fly back wearing shackles, well, that what they get for being, like, foreign.
In the meantime, the Trump Freedom Tower Biscayne Hotel, Library, and Massage Parlor will draw crowds of pilgrims from all over the world, from Idaho to Oklahoma, to stay in one of its luxurious MAGA suites and worship at his shrine, drawn in like bugs to a glue trap.
Florida should be proud.

The recent mass shooting in Minneapolis, where two children —Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10 — were killed outside a Catholic school, is a tragic reminder of the urgent need for action. In response, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Connecticut advocates called on lawmakers to strengthen gun laws and ensure schools are safe places for children.

Melissa Kane is the Democratic First Selectman candidate.
Some politicians responded by calling Sen. Blumenthal’s remarks “faux outrage” and a “sad attempt to politicize this tragedy.” That reaction is exactly the problem.
Gun violence has been treated as optional by too many leaders, who refuse to see it as the urgent public health crisis it is. Instead of working with us to prevent tragedies, they blame “rhetoric” and “the media” while sidestepping the clear evidence: States – like Connecticut – with stronger gun laws have fewer gun deaths. That is not “faux outrage.” That is fact.
Here in Connecticut, our laws—Ethan’s Law, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, extreme risk protection orders—have saved lives. We are proof that smart gun policy works. But our borders are porous, and weak laws in other states undermine our progress. That is why national action is necessary.
No parent should have to send their child to school fearing they may not come home. And in a country where politically motivated shootings are on the rise — from attacks on faith communities to violence at political events — we cannot ignore the reality that gun violence and political violence are increasingly intertwined. No community should normalize daily shootings. And no elected official should score political points off the grief of families while blocking the very policies that could protect them.
Gun violence prevention isn’t about left versus right. It’s about life versus death. Inaction comes at a cost we can no longer afford.

Then Oct. 7, 2023, happened, when Hamas invaded Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people and the taking of 250 hostages. It must also be said that Israel had been committing war crimes against the Palestinians for decades. Having been to the West Bank and Israel, and having friends in both places, I was moved to raise my voice against the killing of civilians in Israel and then, for the past two years, against the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the accelerated ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the West Bank. I helped organize a 25-mile Walk for Gaza, a New Haven Freedom Flotilla, speaking engagements, and fundraising to feed starving Palestinians.

And then Trump came back to power, legitimized by winning the popular vote and turbocharged by Project 2025 – which he claimed to have no knowledge of – to systematically destroy our democracy, focusing as he has from the beginning of his first run for president on immigrants, whom he has described as “criminals, rapists, vermin, scum.” Speaking Spanish, having traveled in several Latin American countries, and having worked alongside immigrants for many years, I began reporting on the immigrants’ rights movement in Connecticut and was drawn to providing support where I could.
There are only 24 hours in a day, and it could be said that I was spreading myself way too thin, being ineffective as I tried to cover too many bases. Yet, another way to look at it is that these three issues – climate, Palestine, and immigration – are closely linked, and it’s critical to lift up those connections.
The climate is changing faster in some parts of the world than others. Among the hardest hit countries are those in the Northern Triangle of Central America – Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – where climate-supercharged hurricanes have devastated the region and ongoing drought has destroyed subsistence farming. When I was on the U.S./Mexico border in 2019, I met many immigrants who told me it was flee or starve. The U.S., as the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, has played a direct role in this scenario, and those three countries have made an outsized contribution to the flow of immigrants at the southern border.
As for Palestine, war has the most concentrated impact on the climate of all human activities. A recent study on greenhouse gas emissions from the war in Gaza shows that “The carbon footprint of the first 15 months of Israel’s war on Gaza will be greater than the annual planet-warming emissions of a hundred individual countries, exacerbating the global climate emergency on top of the huge civilian death toll.” And, of course, the war has gone on an additional nine months, with even more intense bombing as Israel aims to flatten every building in Gaza. It’s not only genocide, but ecocide, as wells are destroyed and all living things suffer and die and the ecosystem itself is being irreparably damaged under the millions of tons of crushed concrete and dust.
What about the connection between Palestine and immigration? Of course, people in Gaza can’t leave now, but Israeli leader and official war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu would like to push them, as well as Palestinians in the West Bank, off their land to some unknown destination. They are determined to stay, although they are paying an enormous price.
Their tragic dilemma just highlights the agony of migrants everywhere, most of whom want to stay in their own countries and only start moving through the push of necessity. Another connection is that Palestinian immigrants – like Columbia University activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi – have been caught up in Trump’s illegal prosecution and attempted deportation of legal residents (green card holders), encouraging solidarity between immigrants and Palestine activists.
The ”poster girl,” as it were, for the unity of these issues is Greta Thunberg, who gained worldwide fame as a teenager demanding climate action from world leaders. She has now stepped into the role of human rights campaigner (although clearly climate action is also part of the fight for human rights). She was arrested by Israel and deported for her role in an earlier Freedom Flotilla, trying to bring material aid to Gaza by sea. She later became part of the Global Sumud (“steadfastness” in Arabic) Flotilla of 47 small boats with crew from 45 countries which again tried, unsuccessfully, to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.
Time is short, and these three interconnected issues will determine what the future of humankind looks like.  Even though things often look hopeless – especially since Trump took office – I won’t give him the satisfaction of giving up. My goal is to make things a little less horrible and extend our window of survivability for as long as possible.

Junior Ta’Son Wallace scored five rushing touchdowns in the Spartans victory over the Panthers, Friday October 10.
 
WILMINGTON — St. Mark’s offense lined up at their own 37 yard line in the pistol formation with junior running back Ta’Son Wallace two yards behind quarterback Brett Greene. On the Spartans first offensive snap of the game, Greene turned to his right and handed the ball off to Wallace. A few seconds later he was entering the endzone. 
Wallace ran the ball down the right side of the field accumulating 63 yards and a touchdown on his first carry of the game. It was the first of five touchdowns for Wallace Friday night, leading the Spartans to a 47-7 victory over Polytech.
Wallace finished the game with over 170 total yards and was the catalyst for the Spartans highest scoring total of the season. Wallace scored three of his five touchdowns in the first quarter adding a 19-yard score and 3-yard touchdown in the game’s first frame. 
Polytech responded with a touchdown on a pass from sophomore quarterback Haleem Edwards to junior receiver Zaine Harris. Harris made a leaping grab in the middle of the field and ran between the hashes to the endzone completing the 73-yard play with a score that cut into the Spartans’ lead as the first quarter came to a close.
The Spartans leaned on their junior rusher for two more touchdowns to end the half and finished their scoring with a touchdown pass from Greene to junior Jack Donahue in the third quarter. St. Mark’s defense didn’t allow a score in the final three quarters, holding Polytech’s dynamic offense to its lowest point total this year. 
The win brings St. Mark’s district record to 1-1 and their overall record to 3-4 in its first season under head coach Bill DiNardo. Polytech’s record stands at 4-2 this season after beginning the year with four straight wins. 
The Panthers will face DMA at home on October 17 for their second district matchup of the season.

“We haven’t had any showers since Thursday or even been able to wash our hands,” said Josh McKnight, an inmate, in a phone call late Sunday afternoon with the Daily Montanan.
The state’s Department of Corrections responded to a “water pipe break” at the Deer Lodge facility on Friday, an Oct. 10 press release from the agency said.
“The break occurred in the pipe carrying water from the well house to the main water tank, which supplies water to the secure compound,” the state press release said. “Sletten Construction is assisting the department in repair efforts by providing additional excavation equipment. This water outage affected the secure compound at MSP; the dairy and Work and Reentry Center were not impacted.”
On Sunday, Montana State Prison’s population was 1,610, according to a Department of Corrections database. Its capacity is 1,551.
A Saturday update by the agency said the source of the leak had not been found and that they were continuing to “work and monitor” the broken pipe.
The same release said several agencies had come in assistance, including the Montana National Guard, which delivered 15,000 gallons of water from Deer Lodge. The state also reported 30,000 water bottles were delivered on Friday.
Probation and parole officers from Missoula and Helena are also assisting with security at the facility, the news release said.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Corrections said Sunday afternoon the DOC was working on responses to questions sent Sunday from the Daily Montanan including ones about staffing levels at the prison, the status of bathrooms at the facility, and other issues. 
“The Department is working as quickly as possible to find the break and restore all services to Montana State Prison,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in a Saturday news release. “We’re thankful for the long hours staff have already put in and to our partners who have stepped up to help out.”
Additionally, the state said 50 portable toilets were delivered to MSP on Friday and that they were “in the process” of ordering showers. The state release also said meals, inmate services and recreation had not been impacted.
However, McKnight told the Daily Montanan inmates have not been able to shower since Thursday, and they have been given just six bottles of water a day for all of their needs, including to drink and to clean themselves.
McKnight also said some people who are incarcerated and have medical issues need more fluids than they have access to.
He said people who use wheelchairs have difficulties using the portable toilets, and one inmate has been declining food as a result.
McKnight said the man had open sores that were healing but ripped open after trying to use a portable toilet that didn’t accommodate a chair he needs to use over the toilet seat.
He said the prison already is a breeding ground for conditions such as hepatitis, and overflowing toilets inside have exacerbated the problem.
“It’s super unsanitary,” McKnight said. “For staff and inmates alike, it is a dangerous situation.”
Amanda McKnight, who runs a Facebook page called Incarcerated families in Montana Prisons, said her visit was canceled on Saturday, but she learned about it first from her husband, not the Department of Corrections.
Josh McKnight said an agency official told the inmates that families didn’t need to see the “filth” at the facility, and visitation had been canceled out of “respect for families.”
He said corrections officers are doing their best to try to make sure people stay level-headed, but the situation is difficult for them too.
“I don’t think they want to be here either,” McKnight said. He said one officer told him, “They’re not going to want the public to see this.”
Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the handwashing stations have run out of water, and the portable toilets have been vandalized or are overflowing because there are not enough toilets to meet the use.
She also said people who are incarcerated have not been able to go to the gym, and sewage at one point had backed up in the basement of the kitchen.
The Daily Montanan could not verify the status of the basement of the kitchen late Sunday.
In a follow-up call later Sunday, Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the prison had offered five-minute showers, but she said her husband reported water was trickling down the wall, and there was not enough pressure for a shower. 
Her husband told her inmates were told bacteria was not found in the water and it was available for limited use but not consumption, Amanda McKnight said.
Josh McKnight said people in the prison are on edge because they have not been able to take showers and get clean, the prison stinks, and drinking water has been limited.
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of people here right now,” McKnight said.
Kenzie Lincoln, whose husband, Bryce Baltezar, is currently at the facility, said inmates are not currently allowed to do laundry nor are they allowed any outside time. Lincoln has spoken with her husband via phone for a few minutes at a time over the last few days, she said. She’s also a member of support groups for those with family members incarcerated at the facility.
Lincoln, as well as other family members of those incarcerated, have painted a desperate picture for inmates over the past several days. Lincoln told the Daily Montanan that prisoners had been warned Wednesday evening that water may become an issue and to fill up containers. Inmates were later told not to drink that water, she said.
Thursday brought sanitation issues, she said. Inmates were warned that flushing the toilets could make the water run out faster, Lincoln said.
“The toilets were getting clogged, they weren’t flushing, and they were actually forcing inmates, basically to pee and poop in water bottles and plastic bags,” Lincoln said. 
Phone service has been cut to 10 minutes, she added, and said an in-person visit with her husband was abruptly canceled as she was on the way to the prison on Friday. Inmates are also allowed one bottle of water per meal, Lincoln said.
Bathrooms were cleaned and locked on Sunday morning, she added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Montana-National-Guard-at-MSP--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-12 19:57:10.826640

WILLISTON — More than 100 people gathered outside a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub in Williston Sunday afternoon to protest ICE’s plans to build out its surveillance capabilities at a nearby office in the same town.
The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont. Speakers decried ICE’s plans, laid out in federal contracting records, made public earlier this month, to hire at least a dozen contracted workers at the agency’s National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. It uses intelligence-gathering networks to generate leads for immigration enforcement agents operating across the eastern U.S. 
Demonstrators gathered in the middle of Harvest Lane, the road that runs in front of ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center — a facility that houses a national ICE tip line — with local police routing traffic around them.

Across the street from that center is another building run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which, on Saturday morning, was vandalized with threatening graffiti that appeared aimed at federal workers. The vandalized building was cordoned off by police tape on Sunday afternoon while the protest was taking place. 
Cora Honigford, one of the protest’s organizers, said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and had no information about who had done it. Local and federal law enforcement were beginning to investigate the vandalism on Sunday.
The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is where the plans that sparked Sunday’s protest would be based, is located about 1.5 miles away from where the demonstration took place and the site of the vandalized building. 
Contractors at the targeting center would use social media platforms and online databases to help federal agents locate people who could be facing deportation, as well as friends and coworkers of those people, according to federal records. The plans are preliminary but say work could start as early as May 2026.

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” said Honigford, who’s from South Royalton, in remarks to the crowd, drawing loud cheers.
Protestors held signs bearing slogans such as “No ICE Surveillance” and “ICE Fuera,” using the Spanish word for “out.” They chanted, among other refrains, “No justice, no peace! No ICE or police!”
Several speakers described ICE’s plans for social media surveillance in Williston as an escalation in the agency’s operations on top of the sharp increase in immigration enforcement that has defined President Donald Trump’s second term. The proposed surveillance is likely to target people already impacted by that enforcement the most, said Kate Paarlberg-Kvam, of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a legal advocacy network for immigrants.
“Make no mistake, that the primary targets for this enforcement would be our Black and brown neighbors, who are advocates for their own dignity,” Paarlberg-Kvam told her fellow demonstrators. 
Michelle and Scott Stinson traveled up to Williston for the demonstration from Ludlow. Michelle held an upside-down American flag, which she said was a protest against ICE’s actions and future plans in the state.
“This is wrong,” she said of the proposed surveillance. “They should not be using us as a hub — for anything.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CEDAR FALLS – Over the span of two decades, the Cedar Valley community has embraced urban conservation efforts on their properties and in their public spaces in an effort to improve water quality in Dry Run Creek.
Rain gardens, rain barrels and permeable pavement are some of the more than 300 water conservation practices that residents of Cedar Falls, and nearby Waterloo, have adopted over 20 years of the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project.
The watershed project is part of a water quality improvement plan with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and in collaboration with the Black Hawk County Soil and Water Conservation District. But, over the past two decades, the project has forged partnership with the cities, residents and local organizations in the name of improving Dry Run Creek’s water quality.
Josh Balk, the source water protection coordinator with the project for the past 11 years, said the watershed project has shown the power of community, as everyone steps up to play a role in protecting the watershed. 
“We all have common goals: everyone wants to live happy, healthy lives, be outdoors, enjoy themselves,” Balk said. “Getting involved with conservation, whether smaller or large scale, there’s indeed opportunities there.” 
According to the Black Hawk Soil and Water Conservation District, the water quality improvements in the region resulted in 120 million gallons of stormwater runoff filtered naturally into the ground each year and 3,700 tons of soil, annually, prevented from eroding into the creek.

At Clay Street Park in Cedar Falls, where a rain barrel workshop and celebration of 20 years of the project took place last week, participants could see examples of the watershed work in action. Between the basketball court and the playground at the park, a bioretention cell buzzed with insects and fall-blooming native plants. The bioretention cell, which is another name for a rain garden, not only provides habitat, but also helps absorb rain water that would otherwise run into city stormwater intakes and into the creek. 
A permeable alley also sat to the east of the park and ran up and down the block. The permeable pavers in the center of the alley filter and allow water and snow to seep into the ground below the concrete, rather than send that water to storm water infrastructure. 
Maria Perez, a storm water specialist with the City of Cedar Falls, said these projects were pushed by Balk and the watershed project, but represent the collaborative effort between the city and the project. 
“It’s always a collaboration,” Perez said. “There’s a lot of projects in the city because of this project.”

Balk said there are about 50 bioretention cells in the city, most of them in high traffic areas where residents are able to see and interact with the native plant landscapes. 
These projects make use of funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Program, which are distributed to improve the water quality in Dry Run Creek. It also uses grants from state and local partners. Over 20 years, that funding equated to $3.1 million dollars in cost share funds spent on landowners who implemented the practices.
In the past couple of years, Balk said, the adoption of rain gardens in town has “skyrocketed” and when the project hosts a rain barrel workshop, as it did at the 20th anniversary event, he said they almost always sell out. 
“Thankfully, the Cedar Valley has been very interested, passionate about conservation, and we’ve been able to build upon that, provide the technical resources and the incentives so folks can make this conservation happen,” Balk said. 
Dan Pickar, of Cedar Falls, with about half a dozen participants, assembles a rain barrel at the event. Pickar said he has wanted to add a rain barrel to his backyard so he can water the plants without having to run the hose from the side of the house where his spigot is.

Community  impacts
While the City of Waterloo is not technically in the Dry Run Creek watershed area, Waterloo residents and city staff have been involved in the project as well. 
Kristine Beenken, of Waterloo, said she attended a practical backyards tour hosted by the watershed improvement project last year, which she said opened her eyes to the number of water management projects that had been installed, just in peoples’ backyards, throughout the Cedar Valley. 
Beenken said she already has a rain barrel on her property but spoke with Balk about adding a rain garden soon as well. The native plants in a rain garden, she said, not only help to protect the water in her area, but also make lawn maintenance a lot easier. 
Landowners, or homeowners, like Beenken who want to implement these practices get a consultation with Balk, who figures out what projects would work best, and helps to coordinate technical and financial resources. Usually, the project is able to find funding for up to 75% of the cost of the project, according to its website. 
Adam Himschoot, also of Waterloo, said he is interested in the water management project because flooding has become common in the region. 
“If everybody does a little bit … it might help out,” Himschoot said. 
After stepping out of a fish costume at the event, Cameron Agan, a storm water specialist with the City of Waterloo, said the city has millions of dollars worth of projects on their lists to improve storm water management. 
“So any little bit that homeowners can do, or business owners, helps with that,” Agan said.

Agan said storm sewer lines and plans are designed with five-year storms in mind, but he said the frequency and amount of rain in those storms has changed “quite a bit” since a lot of city infrastructure was built. 
Agan’s colleague, Ryan Shatek, also a storm water specialist with the city, said things like rain barrels, bioretention cells and permeable areas of pavement all help to reduce the amount of water headed for a storm sewer. 
“It’s not a lot, but it does help with a big flush of rain,” Shatek said. “Everything helps.”
Environmental impacts 
Balk said the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project was initiated because of two water impairments in Dry Run Creek, one for bacteria and another for stream biology. These impairments were largely attributed to stormwater runoff in the creek.
Balk said the project “hasn’t quite” reached its goals for water quality improvement, but is showing “improving trends.” He said biological diversity in the creek has had a “significant increase” since the project started.
Dry Run Creek has been subject to multiple fish kills, attributed to releases of manure from a dairy. These instances occurred near Decorah, about 80 miles northeast of Cedar Falls, and outside of the Dry Run Creek watershed area.
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed experiences an almost 2% increase in urbanization each year, which is part of why the urban water management strategies are a focus of the project. 
“We’re losing agricultural land and getting more hard surfaces,” Balk said. “Our land’s changing, and so (we’re) trying to find ways to get conservation in to protect the land we have.”

Tom Schilke has been a part of the Prairie Rapids Audubon Society since 1999 and said he has noticed a change in the wildlife now that there are more native plants in people’s yards and on city property. 
Schilke said he is starting to find more birds in town than in some of the natural spaces he frequents for bird watching. 
The native plants in people’s yards or on city grounds — like the bioretention cell in the middle of the park — mean there’s more habitat, food and better water quality in the area, which draws in more birds. 
“People think we’re just about birds … but it’s about ecology and how it all fits together,” Schilke said. 
Schilke said the society tries to get people to understand their surroundings more and why a bird might, or might not, be hanging around. Building a rain garden in a yard, or planting some native plants, he said, is a “good start.” 
“One little piece at a time builds momentum,” Schilke said. 
Beyond Cedar Falls and the direct watershed, Mary Beth Stevenson, chair of the Middle Cedar Watershed Management Authority, said the water quality improvements made by the Dry Run Creek Project are “incredibly important” to the health of the larger watershed. The Middle Cedar Watershed includes parts of Benton, Black Hawk, Buchanan, Butler, Franklin, Grundy, Hardin, Linn, Marshall and Tama counties. 
“The Dry Run Creek effort is an important model for community-based watershed improvements,” Stevenson said in a statement. “We are grateful to Josh Balk and the Black Hawk SWCD for all their work on improving water quality and educating citizens about what we can all do to improve water quality.”
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed effort has been unique in the fact that a large portion of the watershed is urban, where other watershed projects in the state might be focused more on rural, or agricultural land. 
“Everyone lives in the watershed, everyone has a role to play,” Balk said. “No matter what size land you own, what the land use is, there’s a way to get involved with conservation.”

Kylie Jorgensen)Late in August, Gov. Larry Rhoden called out the South Dakota National Guard to serve  for 30 days as crime-stoppers in Washington, D.C. It’s hard not to wonder why he did that.
By calling up the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, maybe Rhoden is showing his belief that the pen is mightier than the sword.
Maybe he reasoned that the 12-member unit from Rapid City could make the mean streets of D.C. safer — one news release at a time.
With a Republican primary for governor coming up next June, perhaps Rhoden saw the Guard deployment as a way to curry favor with President Donald Trump and get his endorsement.
If any of those is the reason, it’s not good enough.
12 South Dakota National Guard members joining D.C. force at Trump’s request

Rhoden called out the Guard unit at the request of the president. Since there really was no “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., Rhoden would have been better off giving the president a polite but firm “no.”
The images of armed soldiers on the streets of the nation’s capital are reminiscent of the images from third world dictatorships. The presence of the Guard in D.C. may have curbed some crime, but the president’s reasons for that deployment, and others he has threatened, are less than compelling.
According to Trump, troops are needed to patrol the streets of crime-ridden cities ruled by Democratic mayors. Cities with similar or worse crime statistics that are governed by Republican mayors are exempt from an invasion of troops. Politics shouldn’t play a part in public safety, but it’s the first rule of the president’s plan to make big city streets safer.
Rhoden’s decision to so easily buy into the president’s vanity project is troubling. Perhaps he learned from his predecessor that the best way to curry favor with the president and polish up some conservative credentials is to call out the troops.
Gov. Kristi Noem had a bad habit of sending the Guard to the southern border and a willingness to let South Dakota taxpayers foot the bill. In announcing the D.C. deployment, Rhoden was sure to mention that the cost would be covered by the federal government. So taxpayers are still on the hook for the cost, but out of a different account.
A sampling of the D.C. work of the 129th shows they dutifully recorded the patrolling of the Guard as part of the effort to stop crime. They also recorded troops cleaning up parks and tidying national memorials — a good sign of the Guard’s work ethic and a bad sign that perhaps there’s not enough crime-stopping to go around for all the troops on the ground.

One of the South Dakota unit’s videos features U.S. Army Col. Larry Doane, commander of Joint Task Force D.C. After thanking the Guard troops for coming to D.C., he gives a short lecture on self-care, admonishing them to take time for themselves by hitting the gym, going for a run or watching a movie. Doane must not have read his marching order as those are just the kind of activities that Trump says the good citizens of Washington, D.C., can’t do safely because the city is so crime-ridden.
While the troops take time for themselves, it’s easy to wonder how their families are doing with self-care. Going for a run or watching a movie probably sounds pretty good to them. Trump’s vanity project leaves the husbands and wives of Guard members with a month of single parenthood. Employers may need a little relaxation as well, since they’re short-handed for a month.
At the end of their deployment, the 129th will have worked hard to chronicle the Guard’s activities in D.C.—a lasting record of how not to fight urban crime. It will also be a testament to one president’s ego and one governor’s hope that his eagerness to help during this “emergency” will not be forgotten.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9356868-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-12 14:57:43.906374

WILLISTON — A U.S. Department of Homeland Security building in Williston has been  vandalized with threatening graffiti about a week after news broke about the department’s plans to bolster surveillance on social media sites at a different facility in the same town. 
The building that was vandalized is on Harvest Lane, across the street from a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub. At another site in Williston, off Industrial Avenue, public records released earlier this month show ICE plans to hire a dozen contracted workers to do surveillance work.
It was not immediately clear when the Harvest Lane building was vandalized. On Sunday morning, black graffiti was visible around at least three sides. The graffiti included phrases such as “kill yourselves,” “shoot yourselves” and “hang yourself,” as well as “not safe” and “die.”The word “scum” appeared to be written in large letters across the entrance.
A Boston Globe story earlier this month described the building as being used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The building was flanked by police tape early Sunday afternoon. Several federal law enforcement officers were parked outside the ICE facility across the street. A protest against the surveillance plans was planned for outside the ICE facility that afternoon.
The vandalism comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has ratcheted up homeland security operations nationwide, prompting protests and, in some cases, clashes between protestors and federal law enforcement.
Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for more information Sunday afternoon.
This story will be updated.

A bystander reported the truck sped past a stop sign and collided with a tree in a nearby field, according to police reports. 
At the scene were two intoxicated men in wet and muddy clothes, denying they’d been in the truck and refusing to give their names, records show. Though the driver gave in and was detained for driving under the influence, the passenger remained defiant.
“F— you,” he repeated again and again. Officers handcuffed the man, who threatened to sue, yelling that he’d been a cop for 20 years. 
Finally, he gave up his name: Joshua Grasseth. Police booked him into jail for obstruction and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon, since they found a switchblade knife in his pocket. He was found guilty for lying to police.
Nearly four hours away in a right-leaning rural county at the state’s southern border, Grasseth is now running for sheriff as a Republican in Wahkiakum County: population 4,400, the third smallest in the state. He’s spent the last two decades bouncing around small police agencies in Washington, but is no longer a working police officer. Two of those agencies would not share his personnel files, but InvestigateWest found that Grasseth has been convicted of at least two crimes while off duty and has a history of alleged domestic violence and dishonesty. The Wahkiakum County prosecutor says that, if elected, Grasseth’s troubled past would land him on the so-called Brady list — a list of officers flagged for credibility issues — that could undermine his credibility in court.
Grasseth’s opponent, current Sheriff John Mason, drew 85% of votes in August’s primary election. But police accountability advocates say Grasseth’s candidacy underscores a larger issue in Washington: Sheriff candidates are not backgrounded, and the state’s only requirement is that they complete basic law enforcement training within 12 months of taking office — a lax standard compared to what’s required to become a police chief or a lower-ranking officer or deputy. Had a bill increasing eligibility requirements passed the Washington state Legislature last session, his conviction for lying to police in 2022, a gross misdemeanor, would have disqualified him from running. Grasseth has no felonies on his record.
Joshua Grasseth, Wahkiakum County Sheriff candidate, did not respond to InvestigateWest for comment. Police accountability advocates say his campaign is an example of why Washington needs stricter sheriff requirements. (Photo courtesy/Elect Josh Grasseth for Wahkiakum County Sheriff’s Facebook page)
“Washington is exceptional relative to other states in having next to no eligibility requirements for sheriffs, even lacking the most common state requirements like a minimum age rule, or the requirement that the sheriff have a clean criminal record — or at least, no felony convictions — and undergo a criminal background check,” said Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the Policing Project, an organization out of New York University’s School of Law that works to modernize law enforcement policies across the country. “Many states, including California, Georgia, Kansas and Oregon, also require sheriffs to be certified by a state licensing agency and stripped of that license if they engage in egregious misconduct.”
Grasseth, 47, who has campaigned on being “accountable, transparent, and deeply engaged” with his community, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. On his Facebook campaign page, he addressed his false statement charge by stating, “I chose not to provide information about an incident in which I was a passenger in a vehicle. I accepted full responsibility in court, where I was honest about my actions and intentions. I received no jail time as a result of my cooperation and accountability.”
But Grasseth’s opponents believe if he became sheriff, it would diminish public trust for the agency.
“We took many years to foster a level of trust and transparency and partnership with the people in the community, and it takes a long time to build that trust,” said Mark Howie who was the county’s sheriff from 2012 to 2024. “You’re jeopardizing that trust with people the second that person comes in with that type of stigma attached.”
Upon Howie’s retirement, he recommended John Mason’s appointment to county commissioners. They appointed Mason by a unanimous vote.
Grasseth’s past
On Halloween night in 2009, Grasseth, then-working as a deputy for the Wahkiakum County Sheriff’s Office, called off work halfway through his shift, telling management he was sick and going home, but would remain on call. 
Instead, Grasseth met his then-wife at the Monticello Hotel bar in Longview. The couple reportedly got into an argument that turned physical. Grasseth hit his wife three times, according to a witness in the police report. He was then kicked out of the bar and went back to the hotel room alone. 
Hours later, Grasseth found his wife in the hotel parking lot in a vehicle with another man. He fought the man whom he had already suspected his ex-wife to be seeing, giving him a black eye and knocking out a tooth, court records show. She called the cops. Responding officers said Grasseth was “highly intoxicated” and arrested him for fourth-degree assault against his wife. The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and he was found guilty, according to court records. 
The event was relayed to Grasseth’s boss, former Sheriff Dan Bardsley, who “strongly considered” terminating the deputy. Bardsley had already warned Grasseth to “avoid contact with” the man he fought, according to a disciplinary letter.
Later that month, Grasseth resigned. The next year, he ran for county sheriff, unsuccessfully. 
He became an officer at the Lower Elwha Klallam Police Department near Port Angeles in the Olympic Peninsula in 2013. Then in 2018, he moved an hour and a half away to be a commander at the Port Gamble S’Klallam Police Department, north of Bainbridge Island. Neither department would share any information about Grasseth beyond confirming Grasseth worked there at one point.
In 2016, his ex-wife called the cops in nearby Clallam County, who arrested Grasseth for fourth-degree domestic violence, records show. That charge was dropped. His ex-wife declined to comment for this article.
On Grasseth’s campaign page, he addressed the domestic violence allegations raised by his ex-wife.
“These were only allegations, I have NO CONVICTIONS for such allegations because that is all that they were. I filed for divorce in 2016 and have had zero allegations or accusations since then.”
In the midst of the divorce and while working as an officer for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Grasseth allegedly got into a relationship with Savannah Roberts, 21 years old at the time. He was never charged with crimes involving Roberts. However, her sister, Samantha Hoines, said he abused her physically and emotionally and isolated her from her family for years.
Roberts, who once loved playing softball and being with her family and friends, had “become a shell of herself,” Hoines said. “He tore her down. It was so hard to hear my sister think that no one liked her and that she was scared to make friends.”
Roberts remained out of contact with her family for years, afraid to speak out on the abuse because Grasseth was a police officer and she feared retaliation or not being believed, Hoines said. 
During their relationship, Roberts’ battle with alcoholism spiraled. After the two broke up a few years ago and the recent death of her grandmother, it intensified. Roberts died in April this year due to kidney and liver failure, Hoines said. She was 30.

Grasseth didn’t respond to multiple emails and phone calls from InvestigateWest. But a number that traced back to his wife, Amanda Grasseth, who is the Wahkiakum County election coordinator, texted an InvestigateWest reporter asking why the news organization was not looking for “anything positive about him.” She declined an interview request. Grasseth went to Facebook to announce a story was about to be published “including my past and false allegations,” characterizing the reporting as a “coordinated smear campaign” against him.
Sheriff qualifications
In Washington, sheriff candidacy requirements haven’t been updated since 1979 and only require a training certification post-election. Meanwhile, a 2021 law strengthened the backgrounding of peace officers to include a check into whether they are on any Brady lists maintained by county prosecutors.
“An 18-year-old without any law enforcement experience can run for sheriff, and I think that would surprise some people,” said Leslie Cushman, advisory committee member for the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability, an advocacy group made up of families impacted by police violence, experts and other policy-focused organizations. 
Grasseth hasn’t worked in law enforcement since 2021, and his training certificates have expired, according to Washington’s Criminal Justice Training Commission. If Grasseth assumed office, he would have up to a year to complete required training.
House Bill 1399, the bill that failed to pass the Legislature last year, would have changed eligibility requirements for sheriff candidates to include having: a high school diploma, no felony or gross misdemeanor convictions, no revocation of law enforcement certification, two years of law enforcement experience, to be at least 25 years old, and for those once in the military to have received at least a general discharge under honorable conditions. Additionally, it would have required sheriff candidates to complete a background check, which is already required of police chiefs and town marshals, the two other highest-ranking local law enforcement officials in a given jurisdiction.
“It actually is just a bread and butter good governance bill,” Cushman said. “It really is about having strong leadership in place that is subject to the same requirements as the rank and file.”
Aside from stricter requirements, the bill would have limited the authority of sheriff volunteers, who can assist law enforcement agencies with security at community events, traffic control, and search and rescue operations. The bill also called for sheriff candidates to complete an extensive background check — the same one mandated for peace officers —  which would then be verified by the Criminal Justice Training Commission. Both provisions drew pushback from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs and rural constituents.

Howie, the former Wahkiakum County sheriff, opposed the bill. He said he supports more qualifications for sheriff candidates that could lead to disqualifying someone for integrity issues, but he “would not support any state-appointed political body” to conduct background checks on candidates.
“You could have somebody from the far right or the far left that is gunning for a particular candidate because they have different views,” he said. “I just wouldn’t trust that kind of system.”
Dan Bigelow, the Wahkiakum County prosecutor, agreed with Howie’s concern that the background check could be used for political purposes.
“The idea was for counties to be able to elect their own people for better or for worse,” he said. “That was how the state started out, and this seemed to be a retreat from that. Although, I gotta say, there’s some folks who I wouldn’t mind seeing knocked off.”
For police accountability advocates, the prospect of an elected sheriff with a dicey past is even more troublesome as more rural sheriffs, like those in Klickitat and Adams counties, align with the constitutional sheriffs movement — the idea that sheriffs, believed to have supreme authority in their jurisdiction, chose to enforce their own rules instead of federal or state laws. Some Washington sheriffs are flouting the state’s “sanctuary” law by helping enforce federal immigration orders. 
“Constitutional sheriffs are something that we’re worried about,” said Cushman, who testified in support of House Bill 1399 earlier this year. “[They] think they are the highest law in the land and that they interpret the law and that they are allowed to keep everybody else out of their jurisdiction, including the federal government.”
She and others advocating for stronger police accountability laws are drafting a similar bill for next session. In this new version, the bill requires sheriffs to “uphold and enforce” state law.
“There’s a lot to be said for the people, the residents of the state of Washington, to have confidence that wherever they are, their law-enforcement leader is subject to the highest standard,” Cushman said.
Cushman and her organization started drafting legislation for stricter sheriff requirements after former Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer was accused of falsely reporting that a newspaper carrier threatened to kill him — conduct that led the state’s attorney general to prosecute him. 
Troyer was ultimately acquitted of the false reporting charge, but records show his name was added to Pierce County’s Brady list in November 2021, roughly a year after he became sheriff. Pierce County Prosecutor Mary Robnett says his entry on the Brady list didn’t have “a huge effect” on the court.
A Brady list is a record kept by prosecutors of law enforcement officers with credibility issues such as dishonesty or misconduct that must be disclosed to defense attorneys in criminal cases. If a county sheriff was on the Brady list and testified in court, the defense could call out their misconduct in front of a jury, undermining their credibility as a witness. 
“We’re a big county, almost a million people, and he has hundreds of deputies and detectives and corrections officers work for him,” Robnett said. “He was never a witness in court.”
A Brady list designation
Bigelow, prosecuting attorney for Wahkiakum County, said if Grasseth were elected, he would go on the Brady list both due to his dishonesty as a deputy in 2009 and because of his more recent false statement to a law enforcement officer charge in 2022. Bigelow said he’s not already on the list because he’s not currently a law enforcement officer.
“He called out sick when he wasn’t sick,” said Bigelow, Wahkiakum County prosecutor. “That’s an act of dishonesty but not a crime. An act of dishonesty in his official capacity would go on the [Brady] list anyhow. What really locked it in was the conviction for a false statement to a public servant. … Those would all go on the list.”
In 2022, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys adopted a model policy advising county prosecutors to “err on the side of disclosure” when deciding whether to place someone on the Brady list. The Wahkiakum County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said it follows this policy. 
As part of an ongoing series examining officers with credibility issues in Washington, InvestigateWest reviewed hundreds of Brady list records and found a wide variety of reasons why officers in Washington were placed on the Brady list, including having a DUI, unsatisfactory work performance, being inappropriate to co-workers, time theft, sexual assault and domestic violence, to name a few.
“If you have an officer with, for example, a history of lying, then that should be relevant in virtually every case that officer is involved with,” said Rachel Moran, a former public defender turned professor researching access to officer misconduct information at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. “But if you have an officer who has, let’s say, a conviction for a DUI, there might be very limited situations in which there’s any reason to disclose that in a particular case.
“Instances of dishonesty, false testimony, falsifying a police report, that kind of thing, are the most significant information in terms of impeaching the credibility of the officer.”
In a small county like Wahkiakum, sheriffs play a larger role due to the small size of their agency. The county only has seven deputies, including the sheriff and undersheriff. 
“It wouldn’t bode well for any sheriff’s office in our state, or anywhere, to have an elected official, the leader of that office, on the Brady list,” Howie said. “That would be very damaging.”
Based on the results of the primary election in August, Bigelow doesn’t think that will happen.
“I think that the county spoke pretty loudly in the primary about not wanting a convicted criminal to be their sheriff,” Bigelow said.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove defended his decision to pause some timber sales and said he will seek 2026 legislation to diversify revenue from state trust lands, arguing the state can “do more for climate and habitat while providing stability.”
In an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Upthegrove told host Austin Jenkins that his halt on harvesting in older, “structurally complex forests” — those that have some but not all the characteristics of “old-growth”— began as a six-month hold for restoration and protection. It was intended to refresh inventory data and gather input from tribes, industry, school districts and counties. 
All but four of the 24 paused sales in such forests have been lifted. Three timber sales in the Elwha River watershed remain on hold as a condition of a budget provision requiring a study of whether conserving the surrounding forests could enhance ecosystem recovery from a dam removal before any logging can resume. A fourth sale in Kitsap County will remain paused at the county’s request as it seeks funding to purchase the sale area for conservation and recreation.
As most of the pause lifted in August, Upthegrove directed preservation of 77,000 acres while allowing logging on about 29,000 acres, a split he called a “sweet spot” to limit near-term fiscal impacts while testing new approaches. “These lands don’t belong to industry. They belong to we, the people,” he said, adding his duty is to manage in the public interest while meeting constitutional trust obligations.
The move drew both process and revenue criticisms from editorial boards and former lawmakers, while some conservationists said it didn’t go far enough. 
Upthegrove said he spent months in meetings — including with 20 of the state’s 29 tribal councils — and called the action an internal directive to staff, not a vote of the Forest Practices Board. 
He disputed claims of widespread economic harm, noting 70% of Washington’s wood supply comes from private lands and more than 90% of Department of Natural Resources timberlands are unaffected. He said ecological thinning, acquiring replacement timberlands and entering carbon-credit and other environmental markets could support rural economies.
Upthegrove said his department will propose an agency-request bill in the 2026 session to let the department take part in carbon and other “ecosystem service” markets, which turn natural assets into revenue. Those tools would not fully replace timber revenue, he said, but could become a “meaningful piece” of a diversified model.
He also urged lawmakers to restore wildfire-prevention funding that was cut last cycle. 
A 2021 framework envisioned $125 million per biennium for forest health, community resilience and response; the current budget provides about $60 million, he said. With longer seasons and more blazes on both sides of the Cascades, “without the funding restored, we’re going to see more fires and bigger fires,” Upthegrove said. 
He likened the Department of Natural Resources’ suppression role to an emergency room — “we put it out no matter what” — and cited state costs of about $500,000 a day to fight two large central Washington fires this fall.
Framing the trade-off, Upthegrove said prevention dollars can avert larger suppression bills and protect communities while his agency pilots new revenue streams: “We can do more for climate and habitat while providing stability” for schools, counties and the timber workforce.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Councilwoman at-large Helena Moreno is heading back to City Hall after a resounding win in Saturday’s mayoral primary election, securing 55% of the vote, above the simple majority she needed to clinch the job without a runoff election.
Her victory in the primary will give Moreno a strong mandate when she enters office in January.
On Saturday during her election night party at the Civic Theater, Moreno said the early victory will give her time to assemble a good team and prepare to lead a city at a crossroads.
“The work starts tomorrow morning,” Moreno told Verite News, noting that she would pay particular attention to preparing a city budget that can help her achieve her vision.

Moreno will succeed Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who, in her second term, has been in frequent combat with the City Council that Moreno, at times, helped lead as one of two citywide representatives on the seven-member body. The council has made multiple efforts to limit Cantrell’s power, often challenging her decision-making on everything from mayoral appointees to entering into a settlement with the School Board.
However, despite their frequent differences, when asked whether she would keep any part of Cantrell’s administration in place, Moreno said yes: Cantrell’s popular health director, Dr. Jennifer Avegno, who led the city through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’ll be keeping Dr. Avegno, who I think does an amazing job with the Health Department,” Moreno said.
She did not provide any hint as to whether any other familiar faces would be part of her administration, even when asked whether popular councilmember Joe Giarruso would be joining her team – though she did compliment him effusively.
Moreno held a comfortable lead in both polling and campaign contributions over the course of the election season. The councilmember at-large kicked off her mayoral campaign last year, with campaign signs appearing as early as last summer, more than a year out from the election. It was a bracingly early start – and an explicit claim to the leading position she would maintain throughout the election.
Fellow councilmember Oliver Thomas also threw his hat into the ring early on in the election, announcing his campaign this spring. Thomas, who was once considered a mayoral frontrunner almost two decades ago, before a federal bribery conviction derailed his political career, had recently returned to politics representing District E on the council beginning in 2022.
As a councilmember, Thomas has been a frequent advocate for the Cantrell administration, regularly voting against overriding mayoral vetoes, whether they concerned council approval of mayoral appointees, sanitation contracts in the French Quarter or even her ability to use the city-owned Upper Pontalba Apartment. As a candidate, Thomas has promised to leverage his decades of experience to address blight and improve city services.
As the year proceeded, other candidates also entered the fray. Some were more serious contenders, like former judge Arthur Hunter. Others were less so, like disgraced former Orleans Parish Communication District executive Tyrell Morris. But all failed to meaningfully gain momentum and eat into the early lead held by Moreno.
Going into qualifying in July, many voters expected a two-man race between Moreno and Thomas, rehashing the frequent disputes the two had on the council. But then State Sen. Royce Duplessis, who had earlier announced that he would not run for mayor, changed his mind and entered the race, hoping to offer a meaningful challenge to his fellow progressive Moreno.
Duplessis, also a former statehouse representative, made a name for himself in Baton Rouge through his work reforming criminal justice, health care, worker protections and early childhood education. At the launch of his campaign, he marketed himself as the candidate who could be a real challenger to Moreno, but he entered with little cash on hand. Still, Duplessis saw an opening and hoped he could force Moreno into a runoff.
Less than a month later, Hunter, who continued to trail in the polls, would drop out and endorse Duplessis, cementing the three-way contest that has defined the election over the last two months.
Since then, there has been a marathon of forums and televised debates and questionnaires. In some ways, the candidates’ platforms look similar: All have highlighted their desire to improve city services, increase affordable housing and support the creation of new jobs. In pitching voters, they’ve each played to their strengths. Moreno has pitched herself as someone deeply attuned to the systems of City Hall, capable of implementing her progressive policies without drama or delay. Thomas as someone with deep experience in politics going back to the ‘90s, who can speak plainly and compassionately to the experiences of longtime New Orleanians, especially those impacted by the justice system. And Duplessis as an outsider uninvolved in the current battles between the City Council and the Mayor, willing to leverage his statehouse relationships to achieve his goals for the city.
Moreno first became a public figure in New Orleans through her work as an on-air journalist with WDSU-TV. She later became a state house representative, where she was known for her work championing survivors of domestic and sexual violence in a series of bills. In 2018, she joined the New Orleans City Council as an at-large member, where she became known as one of the more progressive councilmembers as she passed a reams of ordinances, most notably, helping relocate the residents of Gordon Plaza, increasing wages for city workers and promoting renewable energy.
She will become New Orleans’ second woman mayor in its history, and its first Hispanic mayor.

BESSEMER — The reverend knew what was coming.
As Tuesday’s City Council meeting began, The Rev. Thomas Thrash delivered a prayer that set the stage for the dynamic that would play out in the council chambers.
“May truth rise above deception,” Thrash said. “May righteousness rise above greed.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Thrash requested divine guidance to help the council consider the harm a proposed hyperscale data center could bring to Bessemer and the surrounding, rural communities in central Alabama.
After the prayer, the council got down to business. Despite vocal opposition from residents, local and state environmental groups and the NAACP, the entire council—save one absent member—voted to amend the city’s zoning code to allow the location of data centers in areas designated for light industrial use.
The decision is the first major step, following repeated delays, toward the approval of Project Marvel, a $14.4 billion hyperscale data center development set to encompass 700 acres and include 18 buildings totaling 4.5 million square feet.
The project has faced consistent, staunch opposition from residents living both within Bessemer city limits and in the rural, unincorporated areas surrounding the proposed development site. Locals have expressed concerns about excessive energy usage, increased utility rates, potential watershed contamination, habitat destruction, noise pollution and years of disruptive construction traffic.
Bessemer’s relatively small City Council chambers were packed to capacity Tuesday evening, with residents spilling into the hallway and herded into an overflow room on a different floor. The only levity in the somber crowd was a spontaneous “Roll Tide” someone interjected after the Pledge of Allegiance.
Residents in the audience were more subdued than in the numerous meetings most had attended again and again as the City Council and Bessemer’s Planning and Zoning Commission considered and reconsidered proposals involving zoning and development plans related to Project Marvel.
Before the council’s vote, President Donna Thigpen emphasized that the ordinance under consideration—a measure to allow data centers in areas with industrial zoning—wasn’t specific to Project Marvel.
“It has been suggested that there’s other properties that might be more suitable or more favorable, but to do that, even in another place, this would have to be had,” Thigpen told those gathered.
Indeed, the proposed ordinance wouldn’t simply impact the possible siting of Project Marvel on land slated to be rezoned from agricultural to light industrial use. Under the proposal, future data center projects, too, could be located in areas zoned for the latter purpose.
Before Tuesday’s vote to change Bessemer’s zoning ordinance, light industrial uses included facilities like bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
Residents have argued that commissioners should vote down the allowance of data centers in light industrial zones because the facilities simply don’t fit the definition of light industrial development and aren’t comparable to facilities that are typically permitted under that classification.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan, a resident affected by the project, previously told city officials. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.
Residents dress in red to show their opposition to the proposed data center hold signs that read “Vote NO on the proposed data center in Bessemer.” (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
Several other residents spoke during Tuesday’s meeting to express their concerns, asking the council to more deeply research the different types of data centers, their sizes and impacts. But to their consternation, members of the overflow crowd in the downstairs waiting room at City Hall weren’t allowed to voice their views during this meeting.
Sarah Stokes, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, expressed her dismay that residents among the overflow crowd weren’t allowed to speak and were given no explanation from officials as to why.
“That’s not the law for the public hearing. You have to be able to be heard,” she said.
William Spencer, who owns Spencer Wood Recycling in Bessemer, was also upset by what he viewed as an effort to limit dissent. Spencer said he witnessed a police officer stop a lady in a red shirt “with force” and told her she couldn’t go upstairs to the council meeting to speak.
Ultimately, the council voted unanimously to approve the change to the city’s zoning ordinance, making way for data centers of any size and scope to be located in land zoned for light industrial use.
Spencer called the council’s rapid approval a farce.
“I think that they’re railroading,” he said. “For them to make it light industrial and give a positive spin on light industrial for something that’s heavy industrial pulling all of this diesel power, I think that it’s a farce.”
Spencer wasn’t the only one to think the fix was in before the meeting even began.
In a press release issued the day before the council’s formal vote, the Bessemer City Council reaffirmed its full support for the data center as a “tremendous investment” with economic benefits for both the city and state of Alabama.
At least one city council member has also been vocal about his support for the project, painting those opposing it as outsiders aiming to halt a project at the expense of Bessemer’s city government.
In response to a postcard by the Alabama Rivers Alliance, an environmental nonprofit, sent to Bessemer residents urging them to tell their council members to vote against the data center, City Council member Chester Porter wrote on social media that concerned citizens living outside the city limits had no place to tell Bessemer citizens what to do.
“Telling Bessemer citizens what to do with our land is like showing up at their community meeting and telling them to plant apple trees in their front yards and build swimming pools by their mailboxes,” he said.
The land involved in the proposed project hasn’t always been located within Bessemer, but was annexed into city limits in recent years. The site is located on the extreme edge of the city, about six miles from the city center.
And not everyone views concerned citizens living outside the city limits as undue, outside interference.
“Quite frankly, if we want to talk about outsiders, there’s only one person in that room upstairs that I know of that doesn’t live in Jefferson County, and that’s the developer,” said Charles Miller, policy director for Alabama Rivers Alliance.
Shelby Standfield, an architectural designer who suffers from chronic asthma, moved from Birmingham to McCalla, an incorporated area of Jefferson County adjacent to the proposed data center site, to escape poor air quality. Even though she’s not within the city limits, she goes to Bessemer to shop for all her amenities.
“Air pollution knows no boundaries. It doesn’t know where the county line is,” she said. Even though she lives ten miles away from Bessemer’s city limits, Standfield’s home is located just up the road from the site where, if approved, dozens of diesel generators could soon be located as a backup power source for the data center. “I live closer than some people who actually live in Bessemer,” she said.
Edith Hunter, a breast cancer survivor and Bessemer resident, also pushed back on the notion that those outside the city limits won’t be affected by air pollution.
“Smoke is not just going to settle in Bessemer,” she said.
She said she believes the proposed development is a “done deal” and a “money grab.”
The Bessemer City Council is expected to formally consider the data center’s development plan, one of the final steps in the approval process, at a meeting on Nov. 18.

There are steps Vermont towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future federal declaration requests.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany: Preparing for greater self-reliance in the wake of disaster.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, of Townshend. Campany is the executive director of the Windham Regional Commission and chair of the Vermont Planning and Development Agencies (VAPDA) Emergency Planning and Resilience Committee.


On Aug. 25, Vermont requested a federal disaster declaration to reimburse municipalities in Caledonia and Essex counties for expenses resulting from flooding on July 10. As of this writing the response is still pending. Vermonters should pay attention to whether or not a federal disaster declaration is made and, if so, what’s included; the result could be an indicator of how changes in the federal approach to disaster declarations will affect the state and what costs municipalities and local taxpayers will be expected to bear when disaster strikes. There are steps towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future declaration requests.
Vermont state and local governments are heavily reliant upon federal funding for emergency preparedness, and disaster response and recovery. Nationally, disaster declaration requests that would have been routinely approved have been slower in coming or denied. Furthermore, federal funding for mitigation action that has traditionally accompanied federal disaster declarations through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is no longer a given. Vermont has relied upon this funding for property buyouts in floodplains and landslide areas, improvements to bridges and culverts, protection of floodplains and flood-proofing of buildings, among other things.
What can a municipality do to be in the best position to recover from disaster amid federal funding uncertainty?

Establish a dedicated disaster reserve fund.
Establish lines of credit before a disaster ever strikes.
Learn about public financing tools and options for mitigation projects, recovery and rebuilding.
Develop a capital improvement plan and related budget to identify and prioritize projects. At a minimum this could be a prioritized bulleted list with reasonable cost assumptions.
Use your town plan and your local hazard mitigation plan to inform your capital improvement planning.
Give serious consideration to what infrastructure must be rebuilt and what can be abandoned if damaged or destroyed, also known as “strategic abandonment.”

Hopefully federal aid will be forthcoming to the impacted communities in Caledonia and Essex counties. However, each of these actions will serve a municipality well regardless of how the federal policy and funding realm evolves over the coming weeks, months and years.

Truth telling
Ursa Goldenrose, 16, Hardwick
     We manifest our fear in our hands, as a physical thing. Sometimes it pricks at our skin and leaves marks; sometimes it results in stiff fingers, cracking from a stiffened clench. The keyboard invites an unbeknownst realization to form, almost as if the clacking of the keys – spelling out the words of some reality – is the only thing to make the phenomenon itself real. When focus is placed on the fingertips, they jump and skip, and while they rearrange the saddest words, they also often confide a confidence that allows them to be free.
  What we write pulls our fear out from underneath our hearts. Steady hands solidify each sound so that when the words are read aloud, they ring with truth and vitality. Sometimes these scribbles seem to be the only proof of our surviving those smaller mortalities.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-12 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Government shutdown rhetoric begs the question: Should the sick and injured be denied emergency care?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/12/government-shutdown-sick-injured-medical-care/,"Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, federal law has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment to all who need it, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens.","Based on the ongoing rhetoric surrounding the federal government shutdown, perhaps it is time to ask the question.
The question is, do we – the United States of America –  really want undocumented immigrants receiving medical treatment in our hospital emergency rooms?
If a non-citizen falls off a roof of a house while doing carpentry work, do we want to transport him to the hospital or just leave him in the yard to fend for himself – broken legs and all? If a non-citizen child is sick, should she be provided emergency care?
Under current law signed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, the answer is yes to providing emergency care.
Hospitals, if they receive federal funds, are obligated to provide “stabilizing care” in their emergency rooms to all who show up, including undocumented immigrants.
The issue is worth discussing now because Republicans, led by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, are complaining that Democrats are shutting down the federal government demanding federal funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants.
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell of Mississippi’s 4th District wrote on social media, “Senate Democrats failed America. They shut down the government because we refused to give free healthcare to people who broke our laws to get here.”
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi reposted the Senate Republicans proclaiming, “Senate Democrats are putting illegal aliens ahead of our troops and American families in need.”
In reality, the issue that led Democrats to oppose the continuing resolution to fund the federal government and thus leading to the shutdown has little to do with illegal immigrants. Instead, Democrats are trying to extend federal subsidies that make insurance policies purchased through the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges dramatically cheaper than they would otherwise be.
If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for the estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums will go up much more for some Mississippians.
Some Republicans counter that they will discuss the subsidies once the government is funded. But the main talking point for many Republican lawmakers is that the Democrats want free health care for non-citizens. 
Under federal law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive coverage through federal health care plans, such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Republicans had a chance to take up that issue when they passed what they called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” earlier this year at the urging of President Donald Trump. They did not.
Granted some states – yes, California _ do use their own state funds to provide health care for undocumented immigrants. Congressional Republicans considered trying to penalize those states for using their own money to provide health insurance for undocumented people, but opted not to in the big bill that President Trump signed into law in July.
While undocumented immigrants do not get health care through any federal program, hospitals do receive compensation for treating in their emergency rooms people, including non-citizens, without insurance and with limited ability to pay.
Trump’s big bill reduced the amount of compensation hospital emergency rooms receive for treating undocumented immigrants. That reduction hurts the hospitals, not the undocumented immigrants who the hospitals still must treat if they show up in emergency rooms.
Hospitals are partially reimbursed for the uncompensated care they give to help ensure their financial sustainability and help hold down the cost of health care for Americans. Without the federal assistance, hospitals could be forced to close or reduce services or increase costs for those with the ability to pay through private insurance or through other means.
So, if congressional Republicans and President Trump are complaining about Democrats trying to provide health care for undocumented immigrants, perhaps the options should be discussed.
One option was the big bill’s reduction of money going to the hospitals to treat undocumented people. This option penalizes hospitals and potentially those with insurance or the ability to pay. The alternative would be to provide adequate federal funds for the care that federal law mandates the hospitals provide.
Another option is to stop requiring hospital emergency rooms to treat undocumented immigrants. That could save a lot of money.
How does the United States of America, a country where a majority of people claim some type of religious views, want to address that issue?
Perhaps it is time to cut through the rhetoric and ask that question.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/07045727/U.S.-Capitol.jpeg,,,2025-10-12 07:58:06.521880

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gilman grapples with its identity as rail is poised to return.","LUNENBURG — The inconceivable is happening in Gilman: Rail is returning to the former mill community.
Early this year, news broke that Vermont Rail System planned to reopen a then-defunct section of railroad that runs from one of its freight lines in northern New Hampshire across the Connecticut River into Gilman. The rail company is in the process of clearing and reconstructing that section of track, as well as negotiating with rail giant CSX to purchase the rest of the line, which runs approximately 20 miles from Gilman to St. Johnsbury.
The plans, however, have been a shock to community members in Gilman, a village in Lunenburg that once thrived because of the local mill and adjoining railroad, but became a shadow of itself when the last freight trains passed through in the late 1990s. Around the same time, the paper mill closed.
The mill reopened in 2004, but abruptly shut down in June 2007, with 115 workers immediately laid off, according to a website run by the power company that now owns the property. At present, the mill property primarily consists of a hydroelectric dam and solar energy fields, but its owner is seeking tenants — including those who might benefit from a rail connection.
As the two historic economic pillars of Gilman work to reestablish themselves, community members are grappling with the pending impact on their lives and their town.
‘Pretty pissed’
Annika Chaffee and her husband are two of many Gilman residents whose houses or yards back up to the tracks. The couple bought their house a decade ago, choosing the location because it was quiet and a good place to raise kids while still being close to larger population centers, Chaffee said. The property is sandwiched between the road and the railroad; during an August visit, one of their children played on a swingset abutting the rusty rails.
The Chaffees’ kids used to play on the tracks, which, in mid-August, were in the process of being reclaimed by nature. Trees and brush grew around and through the rail, and Chaffee said the family regularly saw bears and moose on their game cameras.
In the months since, Vermont Rail System has cleared vegetation almost all the way to the mill.
When she first heard the news of the railroad’s return, Chaffee said she was “pretty pisssed.”
“If my husband’s job wasn’t so good, I’d say, ‘let’s head to Maine,’” she said. “But we’ve invested so much into our house, we’ve got so much going with the community. … I don’t want to leave.”
Chaffee said she worries about the many unknowns: how often trains will run, if there will be noise in the middle of the night, if the rail cars will transport chemicals, what would happen if there’s an accident — and if her family’s property value will decrease.
The rail corridor includes 33 feet on each side of the tracks, though many in Gilman have utilized that space for decades, including for walks. In August, a hammock even hung directly over the tracks in the center of the village, near the mill.
That corridor makes up more than half of the Chaffees’ backyard. 
“We would lose a lot if they decided to impose all 33 feet,” she said.
So far, adjacent property owners haven’t heard from Vermont Rail System about its plans directly — local approvals are not needed — and must sit with their uncertainties.
“If the railroad is going to benefit us, great,” Chaffee said. “But if it’s just going to tear the whole town apart, and you lose too many good people, then that’s problematic.”

Rail as an economic driver
Vermont Rail System, a family-owned company based in Burlington, operates more than 400 miles of track in Vermont and adjoining states. While it runs a passenger “dinner train” in the Champlain Valley during the summer and fall and Amtrak uses some of its rail lines, the company’s main business is freight.
Selden Houghton, president of Vermont Rail System, said Thursday that the company has some interested freight clients in the Gilman area, as well as customers in northern New Hampshire that are presently trucking their product from the rail’s current end in Vermont. Houghton said a lot of the goods being moved are in the forest industry but he thinks “there’s some other markets that will evolve as well.”
The company’s goal is to reestablish the connection between its rail line in northern New Hampshire and the rest of its network in St. Johnsbury, where Vermont Rail System owns track. Currently, Houghton said, the company sometimes has to send equipment all the way up into Québec and then back down into Vermont.
“If you look at the map, it makes sense why we want to do it,” he said.

Houghton said Vermont Rail System hopes to be running trains into Gilman within a year and that negotiations with CSX are ongoing; he is “optimistic” they will figure something out. However, Houghton noted, the rail corridor west of Gilman into St. Johnsbury is much more overgrown and has more significant washouts than the section into Gilman. The company plans to look to federal infrastructure grants to reopen that section of rail line.
The biggest reason for the project, he said, is to spur economic growth in the Northeast Kingdom and northern New Hampshire.
“If we can get competitive rail service reestablished by getting the New Hampshire Central Railroad that we purchased connected to the rest of the VRS system, it just opens up a tremendous amount of opportunities to put business on rail and get it off the road,” he said.
Houghton’s best guess is that trains will run through Gilman several times a week, initially, during daylight hours. However, he said, it really all depends on customers’ needs. Vermont Rail System’s nearby line from Newport to Wells River currently runs a train most days of the week during daylight hours, but used to do so twice daily, he said.
In terms of the myriad of pieces of personal property on the rail corridor through Gilman, Houghton said the company is going to initially clear things enough to move trains, but they “certainly need to address any encroachments” at some point. Typically, he said, brush is cut back the full 33-foot distance from the center line on each side of the tracks.
“You never know, based on business needs, what part of the corridor you may want to put a siding in,” he said, referring to a low-speed section of track next to the main line that is used for loading or storing rail vehicles. “It is private property.”

‘Everything needs to be done in balance’
While many are wary, some in Gilman are excited about the return of the trains.
Jacob Fournier has lived in Gilman his whole life and has a great passion for rail, originating from watching the trains go by the windows of Gilman’s middle school in the mid-1990s.
“It was a lot more exciting to watch the trains out the window than it was to pay attention to class,” he said. In August, Fournier said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the return of rail to town, though he noted he does not live by the tracks and is not directly affected like the Chaffees.
“A lot of rail proponents and fans of rail, I think, had sort of resigned themselves to the fact that (the railroad through Gilman) probably was going to get torn up and turned into a trail,” he said. “So the fact that VRS feels like they see a path forward to developing enough business to make it worthwhile to invest in the lines has certainly made us, you know — we’d like to see the trains come back.”
Fournier was referring to the Twin State Rail Trail Project, a collaboration between Vermont and New Hampshire snowmobile clubs and other trail organizations that had planned to connect the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail in St. Johnsbury to the Presidential and Ammonoosuc Rail Trails in New Hampshire via the very rail corridor now in the process of reactivation.
Initially stunned, organizers are now working with Vermont Rail System on possible designs for a recreational trail running next to the rail line for a short but important portion of reactivated track in Whitefield, New Hampshire. They hope this approach, used in other parts of Vermont such as the Burlington bike path, might be possible along other parts of the route.
“Everything needs to be done in balance,” Fournier said. “As a proponent of rail, I don’t want to see the community’s needs for recreational opportunities ignored or steamrolled over.”
Vermont Rail System’s rail revival is also having a striking impact on nearby communities, most notably in Whitefield, New Hampshire, where the unexpected reactivation has stalled a multimillion-dollar library expansion project.

‘Opportunity for connection and innovation’
Kate Baxter is chair of the local task force on Outdoor Recreation, Trails & Tourism, whose members — including Chaffee and Fournier — hold a multitude of viewpoints on the return of rail to town. The group was created during the Vermont Council on Rural Development’s community visit process, which Lunenburg participated in late last year around the same time the rail’s reactivation was announced.
Selectboard meeting minutes from last summer reveal an initial upwelling of community opposition, including a petition against the return of the rail. According to Baxter, the majority of residents — especially those who live on the rail corridor — would rather have seen the former railroad just turn into trees, communal land or the previously planned rail trail.
Now, however, they are focused on making the best of the situation.
As part of the task force, Baxter said she has spent a lot of time communicating with Vermont Rail System about its plans and progress, as well as meeting with residents to collect their feedback and share it with the rail company. In mid-September, she helped organize a meet and greet with several members of Vermont Rail System’s staff.
“I think it was helpful for people to … recognize this as a real thing that’s happening,” she said on Sept. 18. “I think there’s still a huge number of people who don’t even know. Maybe they’ve noticed the trees being cleared, maybe they haven’t.”
The task force has identified a number of proposals to share with Vermont Rail System, including one to retain community access to the Connecticut River and a number of trails alongside it that are reached by crossing the tracks. Later this month, Baxter plans to visit potential crossing locations with the Vermont Rail System team.
According to Baxter, Vermont Rail System said they are “confident” they can work out a crossing  — if there is financing.
“With collaboration of different stakeholders, I am hopeful we can achieve that,” Baxter said in an email. “Overall, VRS seems amenable to creative ideas in general if financing is there.”
Gathered proposals also call for low fencing alongside residential properties to bar animals and children from the rail.
“Every challenge is an opportunity for connection and innovation,” Baxter said. “It’s important to listen to all the different sides so that we can come to some sort of a future that is beneficial for everyone, so that we’re not just a pass-through (place) in the middle of nowhere.”

Mill space for lease
The other historic economic pillar of town, the defunct paper mill, was bought by Ampersand Energy Partners in 2008 and reopened as a hydroelectric power plant. The Boston-based company — which owns and operates small hydro and solar power facilities — has constructed one solar field on an adjoining property and recently notified the Lunenburg Selectboard that it would like to create another solar field on the mill site.
The mill building itself, however, has remained vacant since its purchase, despite several failed plans for new use or improved power infrastructure. Currently, a website advertises space for lease in the “Gilman Business Park,” where the developer is “willing to build to suit on currently empty lots.” According to the website, light manufacturing companies, forest and agricultural product businesses and commercial enterprises would do well at the location.
Annabelle Blake, a spokesperson for Ampersand, said in an email that the company has “had interest from prospective parties” and believes the mill “holds strong potential for strategic investment and long-term community benefit.” Blake added that Ampersand strongly supports the restart of rail operations, which “will bring increasing environmentally friendly options for transportation for potential tenants of the former Gilman mill.”
Fournier said he’d like to see the mill get some use.
“It will never be a paper mill again like it was,” he said. “But if having rail transportation gets a couple smaller businesses in here that can create 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 jobs, that just helps diversify the economy.”

Who will benefit?
During the heyday of Gilman’s mill and the railroad, community benefit was clear: the entities employed locals, paid taxes and created a vibrancy in town. There was an ice skating rink and warming hut along with tennis courts and a hotel, Baxter said. Others remember a bowling alley, train station, union hall and restaurant — all of which disappeared with the mill’s decline.
But now, many residents are wondering how the resurrection of these former economic pillars will benefit the community, and how their quality of life — including access to nature and recreational areas — will change with the rail’s revival.
“We don’t want to have industry come that doesn’t give us jobs or that doesn’t feed our community,” Baxter said.
However, most doubt the rail line or the mill will bring much benefit in the near future in terms of taxes or jobs, Baxter said. In fact, Ampersand requested (though was denied) a tax abatement on the mill property last year.
One thing the community is excited about, though, is having functional railroad infrastructure and someone to call when it fails. During last summer’s flooding, unmaintained railroad drainage ditches plugged up and contributed to washed-out roads.
“No one would return phone calls until these people bought the track,” said Meagan Forbes, who owns property abutting the railroad. “(Vermont Rail System) has been very responsive, but we all have that concern: are they going to maintain it? How long are they going to be around before they go out of business?”
“We want to see something that’s sustainable,” Baxter echoed.
To that end, Baxter has been pushing for a public meeting with the rail company and New Hampshire and Vermont’s transportation agencies, hoping to put the community’s voice at the table.
“I get it: corporations, businesses need to make money, and that’s where their interest is coming from,” said Baxter. “But we taxpayers … we as community members also have a vested interest in this space. We pay for roads, those different elements, and we live here and we want other people to live with us here and enjoy this space.”

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Oct. 9, 2025.
Along with food came unbridled laughter as volunteers-turned-friends in Royalton wound down the clock to a noontime meal on Tuesday for seniors.
The lunch preppers, themselves senior citizens in their 70s and 80s, hustled and bustled in the warm kitchen of Royalton Academy—some, like chef Tony Perkins, since 5:30 a.m.
One wrested a deep bowl of hot potatoes from an old Hobart floor-standing mixer. Another sliced servings from four large sheet pans of pineapple cake baked fresh that morning. Others washed pots and pans and pitched in wherever directed by Perkins, a military veteran and retired court reporter of 38 years who also spent 15 years as a professional cake decorator.
They recalled tidbits of conversations overheard at lunches past: “I’m sorry I didn’t introduce you but I didn’t remember your name,” brought howls of laughter. And volunteer Larry Parmenter of South Royalton rolled with quips: When another volunteer yelped “Ouch!” in the kitchen, Parmenter offered a helpful “I didn’t feel a thing.”
Linda Fadden of South Royalton, a former nurse who worked at Dartmouth Hitchcock for 36 years, said she “failed at retirement a couple times,” a sentiment echoed by Perkins and other hardworking members of the brigade.

The senior center gig is a good time all around, said 89-year-old Marge Turner of East Bethel. “I love being down here. I love just getting [out]. I can’t stay at home—it would drive me crazy,” said Turner as she washed dishes.
The kitchen crew was making food not just for the weekly congregate lunch — 25 pounds of ground beef for Tuesday’s stroganoff — but also to support the South Royalton Senior Center’s other programs that help to ensure food access for older community members in the White River Valley towns of Royalton, Bethel, Sharon and Strafford. Programs include home-delivery Meals on Wheels and a grab-and-go curbside service, which started during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With some seniors receiving meals for all seven days of the week, having variety available in the center’s freezer is key, said South Royalton Senior Center executive director Sue Pirie, who manages the business side of things. Pirie also leads the centers in Chelsea and Strafford.
“So when we do a meal, we do 60 to 90 extra and freeze them, and they’re all labeled,” said Pirie during a tour of the packaged meals side of the operation, as she pointed out a cooler being prepped for a recipient. “And then that way, like, this person is getting six meals, so they’ll have different meals every day.”
In addition to the meal programs, Pirie plans trips for seniors and oversees other services and partnerships, such as with Central Vermont Council on Aging.
Her centers’ joint October newsletter includes a robust and filling-sounding menu — roast pork, homemade baked beans, hearty lasagna — and is likewise full of opportunities. An upcoming trip includes a Christmas show in Portsmouth, N.H., and lunch in Kittery, Maine. CVCOA offerings include “Creative Care Kits,” which are projects that can be picked up and completed at home.
October also means it’s annual-meeting time for the centers, and Pirie on Tuesday was reviewing numbers for the previous fiscal year.
“Last year, which would have been as of September 30, we served 12,789 in Royalton and in Strafford we did 2,620,” she said. “It’s all by donation, so we do a lot of fundraising. We’re looking for grants, that type of stuff. It’s all by donation — we don’t charge.”
All in, a pre-packaged meal by the center costs $12 to produce. That figure factors in things like the packaging, which is compostable, and payroll.
Pirie, who lives in Chelsea and has been doing similar work for 25 years, expressed gratitude to the donors, including the center’s dozen board members and local farmers who donate squash.
While the senior centers receive some state and federal funding, that support feels tenuous.
“We can’t depend on that. You know how things are changing, which is not good,” she said. “They’re worried about their insurance. They’re worried about a lot. And the way I feel, seniors should be the last ones to be cut. …They’ve worked all their lives. We should be helping them, just like the veterans. We should be helping them. We shouldn’t be penalizing.”
In the dining room Tuesday in Royalton, while lunch was served at noon, guests started rolling in before 10:30 a.m. They took coffee or tea and caught up with neighbors they perhaps hadn’t seen since the Tuesday before.

There’s nothing quite like it where she lives in Florida, said seasonal Bethel resident Martine Weaver. “I don’t know of any senior center in Florida,” she said. “The whole thing, it’s all different. We entertain in our homes.”
Weaver agreed with her tablemates on one attractive aspect of the meal: food cooked by someone else tastes better. The social opportunity afforded by the lunch is also a big draw. “You have good conversation,” said Marilyn Pratt of Bethel. “And I never leave hungry, and I’m a big eater.”
While the center’s dining room was largely full come lunchtime, Perkins, who works about 15 hours a week and also cooks for the Chelsea center, wants readers to know there is still plenty of room at the table, and he’s eager for everyone to try his food.
“Everyone seems to like everything I’ve cooked so far,” said the chef, who estimates he has somewhere between 600 and 700 cookbooks and is known for his whoopie pies and fancy chocolates. “But I think one of the favorite meals is the roast pork dinner.”
Barbara Hart, 93, of Bethel offered her compliments to the chef. “The food is great,” she said. “They haven’t served anything I haven’t liked.”
Senior meals available in the White River Valley are offered by the Chelsea Senior Center, Greater Randolph Senior Center, Orange East Senior Center, Quin-Town Senior Center in Hancock, South Royalton Senior Center and South Strafford Senior Center.

Patti Kellogg is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
TOWNS STATEWIDE — As tourists and Vermont residents alike set out on the state’s many hiking trails to admire the fall colors, they’ll find the vast majority of trails open as usual for foot travel. But this year’s drought coming after two prior years of damaging flooding has made upkeep and management of trails more challenging. 
Much of Vermont remains in severe to extreme drought, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System. That’s a sharp contrast to flooding in 2024 and especially 2023 that caused extensive damage including to trails.

The flood to drought scenario complicates trail repairs and improvements.
Waterbars, a key piece of infrastructure to control rainwater flow near trails, are difficult to install both when the soil is too dry and when the soil is too wet.
Stone stairs, which are necessary to slow erosion and help hikers get up steep, rocky stretches, are another piece of infrastructure that is difficult to construct in both droughts and post-flood conditions. 
“In wetter years like last year it was easier to see where water would flow or sit in the trail and therefore where we needed to add these structures,” said Molly Belvo, a Green Mountain Club trail crew leader.
This year it’s been so dry that trail workers have to try and picture where the water will go.
“We can see places that may be problematic in a heavy rain year, but without actually seeing it (now) we definitely could be missing areas,” Belvo said.
Droughts are a major concern on the trail this year. Trail advisories to carry more water when going on hikes have been issued this summer and fall, especially if hikers are spending the night on trail.  
While dry trails are more likely to remain compact to help prevent erosion, the long term risks that come with drought can be concerning to the future of the trail. On top of that, the Green Mountain Club has put out warnings against lighting outdoor fires since early August as the drought turns forest understories into timberboxes.
Floods in 2023 and in 2024 destroyed trails and trail infrastructure.
Roads, bridges, and trails were washed out or damaged in the floods and access roads to trailheads were destroyed.
“I think it’s going to take years to fix all of the damage from the storm events,” said Mike DeBonis, executive director of the Green Mountain Club, the Waterbury-based nonprofit that manages over 500 miles of trails in Vermont.
Floods that last only a day or two can lead to erosion levels typically seen only after five or more years of weathering.
“If those floods happened every 10 or 20 years, that’s one thing, but if it’s happening every two or three years do we really have the capacity with our current volunteers to maintain those trails to the standard we strive for?” DeBonis said. 
Every year, volunteers help repair and maintain trails and build infrastructure to help prevent future damage. 
This infrastructure is not cheap. A three-year trail improvement project on the popular Burrows Trail up Camel’s Hump that was completed last fall cost approximately $700,000. The Green Mountain Club and the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation led the work. 
You can’t do that big of a project everywhere, DeBonis said.
“I think one of the things we have to do is be smart and identify those areas that are at the greatest risk and will benefit the most from large scale investment,” he added.
Changes in federal funding also impact trail work.
“AmeriCorps funding cuts cut out certain aspects of our funding,” said Anna Montesanti, the conservation project coordinator at Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, a nonprofit conservation and agriculture organization based in Richmond.

Funding is not the only barrier to successful trail restoration. The same weather events that cause trail restoration to be necessary also greatly affect trail restoration efforts.
Both drought and heavy rains complicate building of waterbars and other necessary infrastructure. If the soil is too dry, stones used in infrastructure might not ‘suction’ into the holes and can be unstable. If the soil is too wet, the holes dug to put the stones in might fill with sediment and water before stones are able to be properly set, which can cause the rocks to not sit correctly in the ground. 
The availability of crews to lead trail restoration is also at risk.
“People are booking us several years in advance for some projects,” Montesanti said.
Planning and organizing restoration efforts is complicated when natural disasters can strike anytime and there is already so much damage to repair.
“(We) are trying to build with the thought in mind that there will be new disasters,” Montesanti added. 
So what’s the best way to help Vermont’s trails? Volunteering with the Green Mountain Club and local land trusts is one way, according to DeBonis. Donating to trail organizations and also advocating for government funds to go to trail restoration is also important, trail groups say. 
It’s also important to stay off damaged trails impacted by weather events and follow advisories such as the Green Mountain Club’s guidelines.

Prosecutors have charged one of those employees with sexual abuse of a protected person. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)At least two staff members at the juvenile treatment center in Kearney have resigned, another is on leave, and a fourth faces a criminal charge in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers in state custody.
Two of the cases involve months-old allegations, revealed in recent court proceedings. They have sparked concerns about a potential “systemic problem” at the center and prompted the Douglas County Public Defender’s Office to start reviewing its cases involving clients housed at the center.
In one teen’s case, a judge wrote that she was “disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter.” She ordered the state to relocate the teen to a different center. And she directed all juveniles at state centers with cases before her to appear in person with enough time for private conversations with their lawyers.
The recent court filings and proceedings have referenced at least four current or former Kearney staff members in connection with incidents involving three teens at the center.
In a statement, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which operates the state’s youth centers, said it takes every allegation seriously and investigates every claim of abuse.
“DHHS has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment or sexual assault. Staff are required to cooperate fully with investigations when allegations are made.”
The allegations, though, proved extensive enough that Douglas County Public Defender Tom Riley said lawyers in his office will examine the treatment of the county’s juveniles housed there — approximately 20 boys — to determine if they want alternative placement.
“Given the very disturbing information that’s come out over the last week and a half or so, it appears that there could be a systemic problem at Kearney,” Riley said.
Kearney is one of three Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, or YRTCs, that serve juvenile offenders 14 through 18 years old who are placed there by the courts.
Court records show that Douglas County Juvenile Court Judge Amy Schuchman learned during a mid-September hearing that a 17-year-old at the Kearney center had been “in a relationship” with a 23-year-old staff member.
Later that same month, Schuchman learned that an 18-year-old at the same center had disclosed “incidents of sexual assault” by a different staff member, according to a court order.
In both cases, YRTC leaders learned of the alleged misconduct months earlier, but the state didn’t disclose it to probation officials, the boys’ attorneys or the judge.
In the 18-year-old’s case, March emails between YRTC staff and the Nebraska State Patrol showed a cellphone was found with “nude pictures and videos of youth at the facility” and “nude content” from a female staff member, according to an order.
Riley said it appears the employee provided the phone to several teens at the center.
Text messages showed “inappropriate text communication for an ongoing period of time,” with the woman referring to the teen as her “future hubby” and asking whether he’d live with her after he was released. (The staffer is not being named in print, because she has not been charged with a crime.)
The state didn’t disclose any of that information, though the teen had appeared in court in July for an unrelated hearing, according to the court order.
“This Court is disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter and cannot say that continued commitment to the YRTC at this time would” be in the 18-year-old’s best interest, Schuchman wrote.
The staff member has resigned from the YRTC, according to court proceedings.
For months, officials at the state-run Kearney Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center did not disclose allegations of inappropriate sexual contact involving staff members and teenagers in custody at the center. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)
In the 17-year-old’s case, YRTC officials substantiated allegations in April. Evidence included a “sexually graphic written conversation” and “sexually graphic videos” between the teen and staff member.
But the center didn’t report the allegations directly to law enforcement and — despite knowing about the allegations at the time of an earlier hearing — it didn’t report them to probation until just before the September hearing.
In both cases, Schuchman ordered the state to move the boys to another facility. On Oct. 2, she issued a broader order requiring that any youth committed to a YRTC be transported to court for their hearings with “ample time for them to consult with their attorneys” and other adults.
At a hearing Wednesday, lawyers and Schuchman pressed DHHS staff about the department’s handling of the 17-year-old’s case.
The staffer initially reported the teen for inappropriate touching, according to Shaylee Fortner, a DHHS facility compliance administrator. (The staffer has not been charged with a crime.)
Within days, a compliance manager reviewed the graphic note and video surveillance, the staff member was placed on paid suspension and she resigned, according to DHHS staff testimony. After further investigation, the compliance manager contacted the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, according to Fortner.
“I do not believe my team directly notified anybody else, externally,” she said.
An internal, non-criminal investigation determined the staff member had merely allowed inappropriate contact with the 17-year-old to continue for too long before reporting it, according to Fortner. YRTC’s determination didn’t change as more information surfaced, though Fortner said her office contacted the hotline a second time.
YRTC Kearney reprimanded the 17-year-old, giving him a “major violation for sexual harassment,” which was reported to his attorney and others in a monthly progress letter. The letter didn’t mention any details of the allegations or relationship with the staff member, according to testimony.
When the 17-year-old’s lawyer called his client’s living unit manager, Steven Huffman, to ask about the incident, Huffman told the lawyer that he wouldn’t believe anything the boy said. At the time of the phone call, Huffman had already seen the video surveillance and graphic note.
In court, the boy’s lawyer asked Huffman why he said that he shouldn’t believe his client.
“I really don’t have an answer for you,” Huffman responded.
As a result of the incident, Huffman said he now does more training with new employees about boundaries.

Under state law, it’s a felony to subject someone in DHHS custody to sexual contact. Consent is not a defense. DHHS’s own policy requires the YRTC to contact the State Patrol if evidence supports criminal prosecution, according to testimony.
But Fortner, the DHHS facility compliance administrator, said the video footage only substantiated allegations that the youth touched the staff member.
“We reviewed … copious amounts of video, and we only ever found incidents of him touching her inappropriately outside of the clothing,” Fortner said.
Under questioning, though, Fortner acknowledged that the video showed the staff member smiling and laughing while the teen touched her. And Fortner confirmed that the confiscated note included the staff and youth talking about sex acts and her writing that she likes it when he’s jealous.
Judge Schuchman asked Fortner: “You’ve said several times that, when you reviewed video, you only found incidents of (the youth) touching the staff. But are you aware that that could also be a crime? That sexual contact, as defined by the Nebraska statutes, can be the touching by the victim of the actor’s sexual or intimate parts or the clothing covering it — are you aware of that?”
“I would have to say no,” Fortner replied.
Denis Lemus, the teen’s attorney, said in an emailed statement that progress reports often include that children need to take accountability for their actions rather than avoid negative consequences. It seems the center doesn’t “practice what it preaches,” he said.
“The offending staff member was allowed to resign, while they used the incident as the catalyst to set back my client’s progress at the facility, thereby prolonging his stay,” Lemus said. “I am disheartened, and frankly sickened, that the YRTC seems more concerned with trying to protect [its] reputation than trying to protect the children in their care.”
In its statement, DHHS said it complies with requirements and procedures laid out in state and federal law and adheres to standards set by the American Correctional Association.
Once abuse is reported, the department immediately separates the teen from the implicated staff member, who is escorted off the property, according to DHHS. The teen is provided immediate medical and mental health care, and the department reports each case to the abuse and neglect hotline. Reports are sent to law enforcement for investigation. The department cooperates with the Nebraska State Patrol and follows protocol to notify the Office of Inspector General and probation.

Two additional cases surfaced during the questioning Wednesday.
Fortner said she very recently learned that a confidential reporter had called the child abuse hotline alleging inappropriate sexual contact between the same 17-year-old and another Kearney staffer. It prompted a new investigation and alert to the State Patrol, Fortner said. That staffer is now on paid suspension, according to Fortner.
And in September, authorities charged former Kearney YRTC staff member Martha Ruiz Palacios, 28, with second-degree sexual abuse of a protected individual. Court filings allege she had sexual contact with a 16-year-old at the center sometime between July 31 and Aug. 2. Ruiz Palacios’ employment with the department ended Aug. 4, according to DHHS. She is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 17.
At one point during Wednesday’s hearing, Schuchman asked Fortner how many staff members since March 2025 had resigned or been fired due to “inappropriate sexual allegations.”
Fortner said she didn’t know.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/ct-solar-power-gravel-pit-pushback/,Experts warn the pushback against solar could threaten CT's ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,"The first time Chris Dahl heard rumblings of a plan to build a large solar array among the corn fields and tobacco sheds of East Windsor, she said the project sounded like a good enough idea.
A portion of the land slated for development included a sand and gravel quarry that had become an attractive hangout for underage drinkers and ATV riders, much to the displeasure of local residents and town officials.
Plus, Dahl said, the project promised to produce gobs of clean, carbon-free electricity  — the kind of mission that she and her wife, Robin Chesky, had supported by installing solar panels on the roof of their own home in town.
Dahl wasn’t alone in her initial feelings about the project, which even adopted a name highlighting its adaptive reuse of the old quarry: Gravel Pit Solar.
Local officials also threw their support behind it, citing the project’s benefits to the town as well as Connecticut’s broader effort to shift away from its reliance on older fuel-burning power plants. While testifying in favor of Gravel Pit Solar’s application before state regulators in 2020, East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said the community was “very supportive of renewable energy projects, especially when the projects make sense for us.”
“This is not going to be something that becomes an eyesore,” he added.
But by the time Gravel Pit Solar began to take shape in late 2021, Dahl and others were having second thoughts.

They grew alarmed as they watched construction spread beyond the gravel pit area onto hundreds of acres of surrounding farmland. Trees and shrubs were cleared to make way for solar panels, and workers erected a wire fence around the site, which Dahl said she feared would block the movement of local wildlife.
The first she time drove over a hill and witnessed the extent of the project, Dahl said she began to cry. 
“It just overwhelmed me,” she said. “Gone was the farmland. Gone was the open space, now it was filled with panels … It was really unexpected for me, and I think other people have had similar experiences.”
With an output of up to 120 megawatts, Gravel Pit Solar is by far the largest solar array in Connecticut and one of the largest in New England. Its thousands of panels are enough to cover more than 350 football fields and are capable of producing roughly one-quarter of all the existing utility-scale solar power in the state. The site runs from Apothecaries Hall and Windsorville roads on the north side to Plantation Road on the south, according to the site plans. 
Its construction has made East Windsor the forerunner in the state’s charge toward solar energy development. Surrounding towns, too, have joined in the bonanza with other large arrays sprouting up on former farm fields throughout the region. 
After initially welcoming the Gravel Pit project, however, many residents and local officials now say they’ve soured on the town’s status as a hotbed for the solar industry. Critics have accused developers of snatching up farmland, altering the rural character of the town and ignoring local concerns about noise and safety.
And East Windsor isn’t the only Connecticut community where solar opposition is on the rise. Experts warn the growing pushback could threaten the state’s ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by deploying new, cleaner forms of electricity generation.
Still, solar developers haven’t slowed down.

Roughly a month after commencing full operations in April, Gravel Pit’s developers, DESRI Holdings, filed a request with the Connecticut Siting Council to expand the existing facility by another 30 megawatts onto adjacent properties. The company has also revealed its plans to build a second 100-megawatt facility, Saltbox Solar, on farmland in the towns of East Windsor and Ellington.
“Connecticut needs additional power to meet future demand, and state law requires all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2040,” the company said in a statement.
“Regulators determine how to balance those needs with local concerns,” the statement continued. “DESRI is proud to help provide affordable, clean power to the state by developing projects that are consistent with state policy and is committed to engaging local communities throughout the process.”
In an effort to marshal the local opposition to solar expansion, Dahl and Chesky formed East Windsor Residents for Responsible Solar Development and have been collecting hundreds signatures from people urging the Siting Council to reject the latest proposal.
Their efforts have attracted the support of state lawmakers — even some who strongly support the state’s clean-energy efforts — who are now pressing for systemic changes to the process of approving larger solar arrays and other renewable energy projects that would give cities and towns more of a say in determining whether those facilities get built.
“We don’t want any more of these,” East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said recently. “I want to be very clear — we don’t want any more of these.”

Who gives the go-ahead
That systemic change lawmakers are considering could begin with the Connecticut Siting Council. Established in 1971, the council regulates the placement of power plants and electric transmission lines, a process that was previously controlled largely by the use of eminent domain by utility companies.
The council’s jurisdiction has since grown to include cell phone towers, hazardous waste facilities and other types of vital infrastructure projects that often meet with heavy pushback from neighbors. For that reason, the council has the final say over siting such facilities, preempting local control.
“It was basically to end town-by-town regulation of these larger projects that impact interstate commerce,” said Melanie Bachman, who has served as the executive director of the Siting Council since 2013. 
If each town had the authority to veto projects within its borders, she added, “the lights would go off and telecommunications would go out.”
Critics, however, say the Siting Council has gone too far in weighing the interests of developers over local opposition. They point to the fact that the council has, in recent years, approved more than 80% of its applications to build large solar arrays. (By statute, the council has jurisdiction over siting any electric-generating facility over 1 megawatt, though developers of smaller projects can waive their exclusion to avoid leaving the decision up to municipal officials.)
“We look at the state and say, ‘You need to do a better job, because these are being built in residential zones, and the impact on the community and the residents that have purchased property next to them is huge,'” Dahl said.

(Mid-America All-Indian Museum)It is one of the most recognizable pieces of art in Kansas.
“The Keeper of the Plains” is Blackbear Bosin’s 44-foot steel sculpture of a Native American, hands lifted to the heavens. It is installed on a rocky plinth above the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers near downtown Wichita and, since its creation in 1974, has become synonymous with the city — its aspirations and hopes and the First Peoples who came before.
It is also a Mercator of worlds.
Land and river, city and plain, earth and sky, past and present.
Red and white.
If only Bosin were still around, he might be able to tell us what it’s like to straddle two worlds. Alas, Bosin — who was born in a tipi in Oklahoma and was of Kiowa-Comanche heritage — died 45 years ago.
But the subjunctive capacity survives in his work, the ability of one soul to reveal a glimpse of itself to another in an eternal game of what if? If I had been born in another culture, or another time, or a different place, this is what my eyes might have captured, this is what my heart may have held. This is the secret of all great or at least good art: the ability to transmit experience.
I’ve been thinking about Bosin because this three-day weekend marks Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The holiday is celebrated in some localities on the second Monday in October, as an alternative to the Columbus Day federal holiday. In Kansas, despite attempts by advocates to set aside a day to respect and honor First Peoples, Indigenous People’s Day is not a paid holiday for state employees. Many cities and schools in the state do mark the day, however. It is recognized in Wichita by proclamation and was celebrated Saturday, with remembrance and a Trail of Tears walk at the Mid-America All-Indian Museum.
The museum, on the triangle of land between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers, is almost in the shadow — just a short walk away — of the “Keeper of the Plains.” Established in 1969, the site was originally called a center instead of a museum, but it’s really both; not only is it a meeting place that hosts cultural events such as powwows and book talks, but it also has a collection of 3,000 American Indian artifacts.
In June, I spoke at the museum about my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations: A Personal Exploration of the Arkansas River.” I arrived a little early for my talk and, as I walked among the exhibits, I became absorbed in the work of Bosin.
Studying his other work made me see “Keeper of the Plains” differently.
“Keeper” is his only sculpture, and I’ve seen it so often and for so long — in person, in newsprint, on postcards and regional television — that I took it for granted as a part of the Wichita landscape. Dedicated in 1974, in advance of the nation’s bicentennial, over the years it became hidden by surrounding trees. It was later placed on a raised plaza and became the centerpiece of an eight-year, $20 million river beautification and renovation project completed in 2007.
The location of the “Keeper,” where the big and little rivers meet, is of special significance to several First Nations. It’s been inhabited for centuries. The headwaters of the Arkansas River — the big river, the one most folks in Kansans call the AR-kan-sus — has its headwaters on the Continental Divide above Leadville, Colorado, more than 600 miles and about 9,000 feet of elevation away. The headwaters of the little river are 80 miles away in Rice County and not far from the ancient Native American “Serpent Effigy.”

In “Elevations,” I described rivers as liminal spaces, as those places between. While I was on the spit of land between two rivers where the Mid-American All-Indian Museum is located, I kept thinking back to the idea of the liminal as I looked at Bosin’s art. On one hand you have the quick early sketches and commercial work and on the other hand there are the cultural pieces that vibrate with color and power.
My favorite is “Prairie Fire.”
The original 1953 painting is held by the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa. The dreamlike sky seethes with wind and flame, antelope jump, Native Americans race away on horseback, and wolves (or perhaps coyotes?) slink in the foreground. National Geographic used the work in its magazine and as the dust jacket cover of “Indians of the Americas.” It is the work that brought Bosin national attention and secured his place among contemporary Native American artists of the mid-20th century.
Let me pause and revise that last sentence.
It should read “contemporary American artists” instead.
Bosin was an American artist who also happened to draw inspiration from his Kiowa-Comanche culture. To qualify his work as that of a “Native American” artist is true, but also patronizing, in the same way that makes Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar-winning director of “The Hurt Locker,” bristle at being called a woman filmmaker. Such attitudes toward Native American artists were crystallized in an April 14, 1957, review in the Tulsa World.
Bosin’s paintings “in exhibition now at Philbrook are particularly interesting as an illustration of this artist’s attempt to solve the problem which faces all Indian painters,” opined the newspaper’s arts editor, Maurice De Vinna. “That is, how to avoid repetition of stereotypical motifs without either taking his work out of the category of American Indian painting, or pushing a personal style to the point of mannerism.”
I’m not attempting to be cruel to De Vinna — somebody 70 years from now might take an example of something I’ve written as an example of our thick-headed age — but to underline the patronizing constraint under which Bosin worked. Mannerism was a part of Thomas Hart Benton’s style of exaggerated figures and vibrant color, and while Benton had plenty of critics who sneered as his populism, his heritage was not a part of the argument.
Bosin was born in 1921 in a tipi near Anadarko, Oklahoma, according to a chronology on his legacy project website. His Kiowa name was Tsate-Knogia. At a mission school he became acquainted with the work of the Kiowa Five artists and his mother, Ada, a bead worker, encouraged his interest, although he would have no formal training in art. During the Depression, the teenage Bosin peddled his own paints door-to-door for $1 or so each at Anadarko, according to a United Press International feature.
At 20, he moved to Wichita and worked at Beech Aircraft. He was a Marine during World War II, and his interest in art was rekindled while recovering from an illness in Hawaii. His first one-man show was in Honolulu in 1945.
Back in Wichita after the war, he was an industrial designer and illustrator for Boeing. In 1958, he was asked to create a mosaic for the Crystal Ballroom at the Hotel Broadview downtown. The result was “Advance of Civilization in Kansas,” and part of it depicts Coronado’s 1541 exploration of the region.
By 1959, Bosin opened the Great Plains Studio.
“Bosin attained widespread acclaim as a traditional painter,” according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. “While using some manner of the Kiowa flat style, he also employed European techniques of illusion and surrealism. This combination contributed to his work’s uniqueness. Besides relying on his own research and reading, Bosin drew inspiration from his grandmother’s tales of earlier and better times.”
In 1965, he was invited to the White House Festival of Arts and in 1970 was part of the All-Indian Show at the Kennedy Theatre in New York. It was about this time, or slightly earlier, that plans were laid for “Keeper.” The idea for the sculpture came from Elmer Hall, CEO of Kansas Gas & Electric Co. (now Evergy), according to the utility’s website. But it would be years before work began on the sculpture.

Meanwhile, Bosin pursued authenticity in his two-dimensional work.
“Bosin travels from his Wichita home to the reservations of the original Plains people to interview the few remaining medicine men and hear stories of supernatural deeds handed down over countless generations,” wrote UPI reporter Patrick Malone in 1973. “He pores over weighty anthropological finds — all in his quest to accurately chronicle what Indians looked like centuries ago, and perhaps more importantly what they dreamed.”
The five-ton “Keeper” sculpture was dedicated in 1974 as part of the nation’s bicentennial celebration. Construction was funded by $20,000 in state and municipal grants and another $8,000 in community contributions. KG&E engineers and crews created the sculpture from designs provided by Bosin. The skin for the sculpture was made from Core-Ten, a type of steel that doesn’t need painting and turns a burnished red as it weathers.
The 2007 renovations incorporated the themes of water, air, earth and fire. For 15 minutes each night, a ring of fire pots is lit near the base of sculpture. Exhibits along the limestone walls of the plaza celebrate Plains culture, including depictions of bison, ceremonial pipes and dream animals.
“This is not the place I was born,” Bosin told a Wichita Eagle reporter in 1974, “but this is the birthplace of my fathers and forefathers. (The sculpture) has conveyed everything I wanted to say. And I have a very good feeling about it. That is the reason I have asked no stipend, and why I have given the design to the city.”
As he grew older, he increasingly portrayed Plains nations as he dreamed they were in prehistory.
“Late in his life the artist remarked that his paintings never recognized the defeat of the Indian,” according to his Oklahoma Historical Society entry. “Instead, he described America as if Europeans had not arrived in 1492. His art reflected spiritual history, tribal history, and Indian myth. He depicted his people in the same way the tribal storytellers told their histories.”
Bosin died on Aug. 9, 1980, after years of heart problems. He was 59.
“Blackbear never was aware of it,” eulogized George Neavoll, an editor at the Wichita Eagle, “but I loved him with a passion that was born of the land and all that walks upon it, and none trod its surface as lovingly and as gently as the great Indian artist.”
Bosin was one of the most organic of creators. From selling his paintings door-to-door during the Depression to his most iconic work, it was inspired by time and place — and, in some cases, the dull compulsion of the economic. But art flows on, even when the most influential of artists dies, and other generations step forward. The Smithsonian has a striking digital exhibit of contemporary Native and Indigenous artists.
Nobody knows what Bosin experienced when he crossed from earth to sky, or from darkness to light, or from being to nothingness. He crossed the last great border, the threshold to Shakespeare’s “Undiscovered County.” Perhaps he joined his ancestors in a world before history. But wherever he went, he left pieces of himself scattered across our world, in paintings and murals and one singular sculpture.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Shapiro’s Folly — a bridge over Long Island Sound,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/shapiros-folly-a-bridge-over-long-island-sound/,Connecticut has been buzzing over a local housing developer's fantastical pipe-dream of a bridge to Long Island.,"Why is much of Connecticut talking about a bridge from Bridgeport, across Long Island Sound, to New York State?  How did we get sucked into a debate about a project that every transportation expert I spoke with said just won’t happen?
You can blame (credit?) Connecticut housing developer Steven Shapiro for this distraction as he pipe-dreams way outside his area of expertise.


“A reporter from The CT Post called me to talk about housing,” he told WFSB’s “CT ‘25.”  “I always liked the idea of a bridge.  And now this thing has ballooned into a massive story.”
He even helped by generating a lovely artificial intelligence image of the structure, complete with red, white and blue towers which was gobbled up by the media.
A 14-mile bridge, costing a guesstimated $50 billion?  It’s a good thing Shapiro didn’t dangle the idea of flying cars to the reporter.
Shapiro has never built a bridge.  His expertise is in affordable housing projects in cities like Bristol, Fairfield, Milford and Easton.  That’s great, and certainly needed.  But a bridge?  Nah.
I asked the Connecticut Department of Transportation about the idea of such a bridge and they said “None of the regional MPOs (regional planning agencies) have this in their long-range plans.  It is not in CTDOT’s long-range plan for the state either.”
It’s not that our state’s planners lack vision… just money.  They must focus on the feasible, not fanciful.
Shapiro says a cross-sound bridge would get Connecticut residents to the lovely Long Island beaches faster.  But that’s hardly the justification for a $50 billion bridge.  And anyhow, what’s wrong with Connecticut’s beaches?
As for the $50 billion estimated price, Shapiro says the new Tappan Zee Bridge replacement, the Mario Cuomo Bridge, cost $4 billion for its three-mile length. “If you prorate that out to 15 miles, it’s $20 billion,” he says.  Factor in inflation and adding a train line on the bridge and you’re at $30 billion.  Rounding upward, because things always cost more than planned, and he suggests a $50 billion price tag is reasonable.
But is that a fair calculation?  Is that how Shapiro bids on housing development jobs?
And what would it cost to drive across this hypothetical bridge?  Shapiro suggests a one-way toll of about $40.
Compare that to the one-way fare of about $75 for a car and driver on the Bridgeport – Port Jefferson ferry.  That makes Shapiro’s bridge look like a bargain… except only those who take the ferry pay the fare.  Build a bridge and all of us taxpayers pay for it, even if we never go to the Hamptons.
And if there were a bridge, wouldn’t that just worsen traffic in Connecticut with more New Yorkers going to New England?
The idea of bridging Long Island Sound has been studied by experts as recently as 2017.  They concluded that there were serious environmental issues and maybe ten or more state and federal agencies would need to be involved.  Most concerning, the report said that tolls would cover only 22% of the debt service (with guess-who paying the difference) and that it would take five years to plan and eight years to build.
Meantime, our state’s housing crisis is happening right now.  Maybe Shapiro could focus on his real skill set and not dangle unfeasible, bright shiny objects in front of a click-hungry media.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bridge-AI-Picture-by-Shapiro-1024x595.png,,,2025-10-12 04:56:49.322137

When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.","FIVE AND A HALF hours into a tedious rules debate at the Massachusetts State House in January 2019, acting Speaker Tom Petrolati ordered a roll call vote on a noncontroversial amendment, and voted no. Within seconds, red lights, representing “no” votes, lit up the electronic vote-tally board in the House chamber as dozens of rank-and-file members followed his lead.  
Then, realizing he had made a mistake (but not realizing his mic was still on), Petrolati stammered: “It’s a yes?… Switch ’em. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes!”  
After his vote on the large display board flipped to green for “yes,” so, too, did the votes of at least 63 Democratic representatives. (The video of this moment remains on the Legislature’s website, beginning at 5:35:49.)  
Beacon Hill Roll Call reporter Bob Katzen’s write-up of the all-too-common event didn’t mince words: “Did these 63 even know what they were voting on? Did they care? What would cause them to switch their votes other than they decided to follow the ‘suggestion’ of the speaker?”  
In a separate interview, Rep. Russell Holmes, one of the few at that time to openly criticize the system, offered a blunt assessment: “The entire legislative establishment is a scam. [The Speaker] is like a shepherd leading the sheep. Most reps vote the way he tells them to vote.” 
Having grown up in deep-blue Massachusetts, I viewed politics through a national lens. Beyond knowing my rep’s names, I never thought much about what goes on under the Golden Dome on the corner of Boston Common.  
Like many, I assumed that Massachusetts was liberal, and therefore, so was our State House. If a progressive policy was doable, the same electorate that chose Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey would have chosen a Legislature excited to make it happen.  
That assumption crumbled when I started working on a documentary about why daylight saving time (DST) reform won’t pass the Legislature, despite broad public support. 
What began as an attempt to use the Legislature’s clunky website to trace the path of a DST bill quickly turned into a ten-month (and counting) investigation. Interviews with lawmakers, activists, and reporters all confirmed the same truth of how laws actually pass in Massachusetts: Just a few members of leadership decide which bills live or die. Debate is staged, and the real lawmaking happens behind closed doors.  
Massachusetts has one of the least transparent, least productive legislatures in the country. Despite our state’s progressive reputation — and a Democratic supermajority in both chambers — our State House won’t pass basic party priorities. This includes bills to:  

Prevent offshore corporate tax dodging 


Implement LGBTQ+ inclusive sex-ed 


Provide menstrual products in schools, prison, and shelters 


Stop wage theft  


Enact same-day voter registration 


End state/local collaboration with ICE 


Ban cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences 

The “Act to Stop Wage Theft” referenced above? It had a supermajority of co-sponsors in the House a few years ago, yet it never received a vote. Here’s why.  
Each law must go through several committees led by handpicked allies of the leadership; committee votes were completely opaque until mounting public pressure spurred changes this summer.  
These committees serve as bottlenecks, allowing leadership to effectively choose what bills get a vote by the full chamber. When committee chairs go against the Speaker or Senate president, they risk losing this position and the extra salary that comes with it. Representatives have even lost pay and power just for being critical of leadership.  
Former rep. Denise Provost has pointed out that leadership used to poll members before major bills. But after a threshold of lawmakers with leadership-controlled stipends was reached, the polling stopped.  
This top-down dynamic should frustrate Republicans as well: Minority Leader Brad Jones cooperates with the Speaker to block some roll-call votes Democrats prefer not to be recorded on.   
No House committee is more important than the Ways and Means Committee. Internal rules require that many bills go through that committee, before the full House can vote on them, making Speaker Mariano’s handpicked chair, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, one of the most powerful people in the Bay State. 
For big money industries, like private insurance, this structure is a gift. Instead of persuading 160 representatives to kill or pass a bill, they only need to win over a small handful of gatekeepers. And if you wonder what their preferred method of persuasion might be, just look at Michlewitz’s campaign reports: Since 2009, he’s run unopposed, yet between 2020 and 2024 he raised $1,995,765.21.  
Beacon Hill’s contempt for the public will is perfectly illustrated by a largely forgotten incident from two decades ago, whose key players now run the Legislature. 
In 2003, Massachusetts residents petitioned to put a constitutional right to affordable health care on the ballot. “Romneycare,” the bipartisan Massachusetts law that served as a blueprint for the Affordable Care Act, was still being shaped, and activists feared lawmakers would gut patient protections to appease the powerful insurance lobby.  
After collecting over 71,000 signatures to begin the process for amending the Massachusetts Constitution, the hard part was finished. All that remained was getting 25 percent of the Legislature to approve it in two sessions. When the first vote confirmed it, 153-41, the second seemed like a formality. However, the vote would never happen.  
When the next session convened, House and Senate leadership backed an effort to send the question to study, a procedural trick to kill a measure without taking a public stance. Lawmakers fell in line, 118-76, and voters never got to decide if affordable health care should become a right.  
Then-committee chairs Ron Mariano and Karen Spilka were among the few legislators to openly argue for the motion on the floor, a gamble that should have made them the face of killing affordable health care. Ultimately, their gamble paid off: Today, House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka each sit atop massive campaign accounts fueled by lots of money from the health care and insurance industry.  
Today, the “study” maneuver is a convenient tactic to quietly kill bills, as citizens are misled into thinking their bill is being actively considered; lobbyists know better.  
When activists challenged the scuttled ballot question at the state’s highest court, justices agreed that lawmakers violated their constitutional duty by failing to hold a second vote on the proposal, but the court said it had no authority to compel action by lawmakers under the separation of powers. The only recourse, the justices said, was at the ballot box.  
It’s taken nearly 20 years, but recent events suggest that political recourse may finally be within reach, and that frustration with Beacon Hill’s establishment is near a breaking point.  
First came last fall’s closely watched contest in Cambridge, when Democratic union leader Evan MacKay took on Rep. Marjorie Decker, a fixture in local politics, making legislative reform the cornerstone of their primary challenge. MacKay attacked Decker for repeatedly taking votes that strengthened leadership’s power over rank-and-file members, undermining the progressive values she claimed to support.  
To say Decker was favored would be an understatement: Her campaign had a four-to-one spending advantage, bolstered by a rooftop fundraiser that drew a who’s who of party insiders, including Gov. Maura Healey. Despite all that, MacKay came within 41 votes of an upset, marking the first time Decker dropped below 83 percent support as an incumbent. 
Then, in June, after mounting criticism for their slowest start in 40 years (six laws passed in six months), legislative leadership caved to rule reforms they had stonewalled for years. Public committee votes, publicly available testimony, and plain-language bill summaries may sound like basic democratic norms, but on Beacon Hill, they were fought tooth and nail. Their sudden passage was such a shock that one activist excitedly texted me: “It looks like we won on nearly everything.” 
Perhaps most telling of all, 72 percent of voters supported a ballot question last November authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, an unmistakable mandate that Beacon Hill can’t police itself. Like clockwork, the Legislature brazenly ignored the result, arguing it was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.  
Let’s be clear: this argument is cover for preserving unchecked power. The auditor is an independent, voter-elected watchdog; she’s neither appointed by nor answerable to the governor. She is “executive” only in a technical, structural sense, not in any chain of command way that would trigger separation of powers concerns.  
If you’re an aspiring activist who feels waving around a “No Kings” sign falls short of impactful activism, look at state government as an avenue for change. Lobbying your state rep will do far more than mailing a postcard to Wisconsin for a judicial election. Medicare for all is likely to happen here long before Congress secures a filibuster-proof majority.  
If your rep is one of the 85 percent of House Democrats who voted with the Speaker 100 percent of the time in 2024 (full list here), ask them directly: Are they proud that their paycheck and ability to represent the district depends on their loyalty to the House speaker? Are they open to supporting new leadership and new rules that put constituents first?  
And if they shrug you off, connect with local advocacy groups and find a candidate worth backing, or consider becoming that candidate yourself. Only under the threat of losing their seats will rank-and-file members reclaim their power to oust authoritative leaders and rewrite the rules to favor voters.  
For decades, Beacon Hill has shamelessly ignored voters, because the public has never held them accountable. Mariano and Spilka weren’t shamed for helping kill affordable health care, they were rewarded. But sooner or later, enough people will learn how democracy in Massachusetts is a lie. When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and a recent high-profile immigration arrest in Iowa, Republicans gathered Saturday to deliver a warm sendoff for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst at her 10th annual Roast and Ride fundraiser Saturday.
Though the motorcycle ride from Big Barn Harley-Davidson to the Iowa State Fairgrounds and following pig roast is a fundraising event, Ernst herself is not running for reelection. She announced in early September she would not seek a third term in the U.S. Senate. Speaking to a crowd of 600 gathered at the Elwell Family Food Center, Ernst thanked Iowans for supporting her throughout her time in public service.
“It is my last Roast and Ride, our 10th year of doing this, and it was just a privilege to be able to wrap up in such a great way today,” Ernst told reporters.
Gov. Kim Reynolds said the final Roast and Ride was “a little bittersweet.” Reynolds, who also announced she will not run for reelection in 2026, said she and Ernst’s political careers were linked, having served in county government and in the Iowa Senate.
“Who would have guessed back then, in those local government days, that one of us would become (Iowa’s first) female United States senator in 2014, and the other would become Iowa’s first female governor in 2018,” Reynolds said.  “Not too bad for a pair of rural Iowans.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said he was “not here to roast Joni, I’m here to thank Joni for her public service and more importantly, saving me from 30 years of having a Democratic colleague” in the Senate. He asked the crowd to help him continue working with a fellow Republican by voting in the 2026 U.S. Senate election.
Shortly after Ernst’s exit from the race, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson announced she would run for the position, and quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Hinson has received endorsements from President Donald Trump and Senate Republican leadership.
Hinson said if elected, she would work to continue Ernst’s legacy in the Senate on issues like immigration, government efficiency and supporting veterans.
“We know that in the Senate, Joni has helped pave the way for what it means to put Iowa first and put America first,” Hinson said. “These values are values that we share, and we are continuing to work together for you. … We’re going to continue to deport those criminal illegal aliens who threaten our communities. We’re going to stop China from owning our food supply. We’re going to protect veterans, continue to work on cutting taxes and protecting taxpayers and help Iowa’s working families to thrive.”
Ernst has not officially endorsed Hinson to succeed her in the Senate but told reporters, “I will tell you that she has my full support and you may hear something more official a little bit later on.”
Video remarks from Ernst’s GOP Senate colleagues including Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott, Markwayne Mullin, Katie Britt, Marsha Blackburn, Rick Scott, Dave McCormick, Ted Budd, and Pete Ricketts thanking the Iowa Republican for her work in the Senate and voicing support for the Roast and Ride, were shown at the event.
There was one high-profile Republican from outside Iowa in attendance at the event: U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has collaborated with Sen. Chuck Grassley and other Iowans making requests regarding the ICE arrest and detainment of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts in late September.
DHS confirmed Roberts, who is a citizen of Guyana, had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, in addition to sharing information about his previous criminal history. Reports have also found Roberts had falsified portions of his educational background and achievements.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who has launched an exploratory committee to run for governor in 2026, said Iowans “owe” Noem for her support in apprehending Roberts. He also linked the incident to Democratic control in the Des Moines school system.
“That is what happens when you have a liberal, progressive agenda,” Feenstra said. “In the Des Moines public school system, that school board allowed it to happen. We can never allow that to happen again.”
Noem said Trump had told her “make sure that you tell them about the individuals in Iowa that we got rid of, that have been so terrible, that have been illegal aliens that have devastated families” when she was speaking at the event. She shared cases of arresting undocumented individuals with criminal backgrounds in Iowa communities like Council Bluffs and Cherokee County.
She also talked about Roberts, celebrating his arrest and criticizing the fact that “no one did a background check on him.” Des Moines school board officials said Roberts had completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation to show his eligibility to work in the U.S. when he was hired, and are suing JG Consulting for not providing information on Roberts’ criminal history and immigration status when he was suggested during the superintendent search process.
Noem said Roberts was “interacting with children every single day, making a six-figure salary with benefits as well, that so many people in the United States could have been benefiting from.”
“Now he’s away from your children, and he’s being brought to justice,” Noem said.
The fundraiser comes on the 11th day of the federal government shutdown. On Friday, the Trump administration began a process of mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns. The shutdown is expected to continue into the coming week, as the Senate is not scheduled to return until Tuesday.
Iowa Democrats criticized Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for attending fundraisers like Ernst’s event while the federal government remains shuttered. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Friday Reps. Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn and Feenstra “are treating this shutdown like a vacation.”
“Why can’t Iowa’s representatives show some Iowa work ethic instead of spending the weekend at Joni Ernst’s Republican fundraiser?” Hart said. “They should be working with their Republican colleagues to find a deal to open the government and prevent a spike in Iowans’ healthcare premiums. Don’t they think Iowans are paying attention?”
Nunn was not in attendance Saturday, though a video was shown at the event of him thanking Ernst for her service.
The shutdown has largely come in part as Democrats seek to extend health care premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have said not passing this extension will cost health insurance costs to spike across the country and blame the shutdown on Republicans for not agreeing to negotiate. But Trump and Republican leaders have framed the shutdown as the result of Democrats wanting to provide undocumented immigrants with government-supported health care – a claim repeated at the fundraiser.
Ernst said Republicans care about allowing people to continue having health coverage, but said there is rampant waste and fraud that needs to be addressed in the ACA system. She said the ACA is not affordable, and that GOP leaders are open to having a discussion on a “different model” for health care coverage after the shutdown ends.
“I’ve talked to a number of my Democratic colleagues about what do we do next, and how can we come to an agreement to open the government and then come up with a plan to move forward,” Ernst said. “And I know the president has been really open to that as well. So, I am hopeful we get the government open, we actually have serious talks on fraud and waste within the program, and then we actually make a difference and make healthcare affordable for those folks that truly do need that support.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ernst.Ride_.10.11.4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-11 18:57:20.290680

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Republicans in El Paso County on Saturday once again selected Second Amendment activist Ava Flanell to fill a vacant seat in the Colorado House of Representatives, after the first vacancy committee vote was invalidated by the secretary of state’s office.
Flanell won during the second round of voting with 34 votes. Joe Woyte received 30 votes. Troy Vanderhule also ran and was eliminated when he came in third place during the first round of votes.
“This position is not about me. It’s about you, about this district. It’s ensuring our community is represented with strong principles and a patriotic voice at the Capitol,” Flanell said ahead of the first vote.
Flanell will join the 22-member House Republican Caucus.
“Like many of you, I look around and see a Colorado that doesn’t resemble the one we grew up loving. This is about protecting what makes America strong and restoring what made America exceptional: faith, family and freedom and personal responsibility,” she said.
This was the second time a vacancy committee met to appoint someone to the seat. They first met on Sept. 22 and selected Flanell, but the results were not valid because the meeting did not meet the 10-day written notice requirement.
Flanell will replace former Rep. Rose Pugliese, a Republican who resigned in September after a public fallout with House majority leadership during a special session in August.
She will serve the remainder of Pugliese’s term and will need to run for reelection next year if she wants to stay in the seat.
The Legislature is set to reconvene in January.

Four were killed in downtown Leland after a high school football homecoming game in the Mississippi Delta on the state’s western edge, a state senator said Saturday.
About 20 people were injured in the gunfire after a gathering in downtown Leland following the game, state Sen. Derrick Simmons said. Of the 20 wounded, four were in critical condition and flown from a hospital in nearby Greenville to a larger medical center in the state capital of Jackson, Simmons told The Associated Press.
Simmons said he was being updated on developments by the Washington County Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement authorities in the Delta.
“People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,” Simmons said of the town with a population of fewer than 4,000 people.
He was told that after the gunfire, the scene was “very chaotic,” as police, sheriff’s deputies and ambulances “responded from all over.”
“It’s just senseless gun violence,” he said. “What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.”
No arrests were immediately announced, and Simmons said late Saturday morning that he had not heard any information about possible suspects.
“They are on the ground working and I have all the faith in the world that they will get to the bottom of this,” he said.
“As the state senator for the area, we are asking any and all individuals who might have any information regarding the horrific shooting last night to come forward and provide whatever information they have,” he added.
Meanwhile, police in the small Mississippi town of Heidelberg in the eastern part of the state are investigating a shooting during that community’s homecoming weekend that left two people dead.
Both of them were killed on the school campus Friday night, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said. He declined to say whether the victims were students or provide other information about the crimes.
“Right now we’ve still got a subject at large, but I can’t give specifics,” White said Saturday morning.
An 18-year-old man was being sought for questioning in the Heidelberg shooting, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department football game Friday night. The town of about 640 residents is about 85 miles southeast of Jackson.
It wasn’t clear exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium. White said he was at the scene Saturday investigating, and that more information might be released in coming days.

Mississippi is among them.
The dates, in late October and November, could be extended, and it is not immediately clear when the other three states will remove their troops. But the planned withdrawals signal that the surge of troops into the nation’s capital may head toward a drawdown or a change in scope.
The plans by the contributing states come as Trump takes his push to send the military to other American cities, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon, which have each pushed back with legal action to try to stop any deployment.
The National Guard was activated in D.C. in August after Trump issued an executive order proclaiming an emergency over what the Republican president said were crime concerns. The order placed the local police department under the president’s authority for 30 days and then lapsed when Congress did not renew it.
But roughly 2,300 Guard members from eight states, as well as D.C., and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers remained in the city. According to official figures, more than 4,000 people have been arrested as part of the campaign since August.
Authorities in Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia all told The Associated Press they had a planned end date for their deployments. The other states with troops in D.C. — Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota — did not respond to requests seeking information.
South Carolina, which initially sent 200 troops and now has about 40, said it plans to withdraw by the end of October, according to Maj. Karla Evans, South Carolina Guard spokesperson.
Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi and West Virginia said they planned to remove their troops by Nov. 30.
The five states together make up more than 80% of the 1,300 out-of-state troops deployed to D.C. The D.C. National Guard deployment is made up of around 1,000 forces and has had its orders extended at least through December.
Asked about the planned withdrawals, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump’s law enforcement campaign in the capital had led to a reduction in crime. “These are undeniable positive results that everyone can celebrate.”
Trump has heralded his crime-fighting campaign in the nation’s capital as a resounding success. And data shows crime has decreased during that time, although rates were already falling before. But the lingering presence of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., has raised questions about Trump’s endgame for the deployments.
The Guard troops have patrolled transit hubs and tourist sites and as the deployment has dragged on, have become a fixture of the city’s urban scenery at parks and in neighborhoods. Their presence, at times armed, has been enough to unnerve residents, although no violent incidents have been reported. They also have picked up trash and in the case of the D.C. Guard, run an initiative that has done everything from help package meals for.
The news of a planned drawdown could be a relief for some residents, who have seen the unprecedented military deployment as increasingly normalized.
“This is not normal,” said Joseph Johnson, a local elected official who chairs a neighborhood advisory commission. “We know this should never have happened in the first place.”
A lawsuit brought by D.C.’s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office declined to comment. Bowser has said on several occasions that National Guard deployed from other states “has not been an efficient use of those resources.”
Some, however, said since the deployment was unavoidable, they tried to take advantage of it, especially with the D.C. Guard members running an initiative that has included cleaning neighborhoods and removing graffiti, as well as working with local food banks to package food and helping to revitalize a recreation center.
“They have no guns. They have no rifles, and they are truly doing what we have asked them to do to come and be a part of our community clean up,” Johnson said.
His fellow neighborhood advisory commissioner, Marcus Hickman, welcomed the additional help when the D.C. Guard emailed commissioners and asked if there were any needs. It allowed community members to work side by side with the guard members. Other plans are in the works, including the D.C. Guard joining in a school reading program, he said.
“When someone offers to come and help you clean your house, there is something to be said. A cleaner community is often a safer community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10132923/AP25282690330683.jpg,,,2025-10-11 14:02:11.717941

$17.5M OneWorld building marks milestone in $235M South and North Omaha state grant program 

When completed, the new three-story health care workforce training center will be the fourth structure at the historic Livestock Exchange stockyards campus in South Omaha, which OneWorld calls home.
The 29,000-square-foot facility is funded in part with $9.5 million from the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. In addition to worker development programs, it will house a child development center and micro-unit for epidemic or pandemic responses.
“This new space will allow us to expand behavioral health services and invest in workforce development, ensuring that healing and growth are further built into the framework of our community,” said Andrea Skolkin, OneWorld CEO.
Work on the facility will continue through next year, and services are expected to launch in early 2027.
Thursday’s event, which drew numerous community supporters and city and state officials to the site, is known as a topping out ceremony in the construction world. As per tradition, people sign their name or leave a personal message on the building’s last and highest structural beam before it is lifted into place. The occasion celebrates completion of framing and symbolizes collective achievement and connects supporters to the cause.

Established in 1970, OneWorld is a federally qualified health center that provides quality and affordable primary, mental, substance abuse and dental care for more than 50,000 patients each year at 20 clinical locations in Omaha, Bellevue and Plattsmouth. The network serves families and individuals without regard to insurance status or ability to pay. 
Canopy South, a nonprofit based in South Omaha, played a critical role in securing and managing the public grant for the project, called the OneWorld Health Care Workforce Development Center.
“By bringing critical health services and workforce opportunities into the heart of South Omaha, we’re not only honoring the history of this campus, we’re shaping a future where every resident has a chance to thrive,” said César García, Canopy South’s executive director.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has pledged to pay $217 of his own money to keep Mount Rushmore lit for the next week.
Rhoden’s Saturday morning announcement came in tandem with pledges from West River lawmakers to personally pay the national memorial’s nightly lighting ceremony bills. Rhoden pledged to cover seven nights. Various lawmakers and one private citizen have made pledges to pay the daily bill after Rhoden if the shutdown continues.
The nightly light bill is $30.94, Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms told South Dakota Searchlight.
‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown

The memorial has remained open during the shutdown, but South Dakota’s Travel SD website notes that the lighting ceremony is “temporarily unavailable.” The visitor center is also closed and ranger talks are temporarily unavailable.
The promise to pay Rushmore’s light bills is the latest in a series of statements from the Republican governor aimed at pressuring Congressional Democrats to fold and pass the funding bill supported by the body’s GOP majority.
Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Democrats have pushed their Republican counterparts to negotiate on extensions for expiring health care subsidies before supporting a funding bill. Rhoden is among the Republican governors that signed on to a letter Thursday urging Democrats to give in and pass a funding bill. 
On Sept. 30, Rhoden signed a statement from a group called the Governors Council of the America First Policy Institute urging both sides to find a way to avoid the shutdown that came hours later. 
This week on social media, Rhoden used the term “Schumer Shutdown,” a reference to the Senate’s Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. Daily news releases from Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, use the term in their subject lines.
Rhoden’s news release on the lights at Mount Rushmore says the payments were facilitated by the nonprofit Mount Rushmore Society through its partnership with the National Park Service.
It also says Rhoden “has received many other pledges to support shining the lights if the shutdown continues longer.”

Larry Rhoden. Hansen and Doeden are running for governor next year. Rhoden has not yet announced whether he'll be a candidate. (Photo illustration by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)After multiple Republican candidates for governor advocated firing university professors recently for personal social media posts, one of those professors says South Dakota politics is sliding down a “dangerous path.”
“They’re trying to limit what universities can offer, what faculty members can teach, what we can say in the classroom, and now, apparently, outside of it,” said Timothy Schorn, an associate professor of political science and director of the University of South Dakota’s international studies program.
After the Sept. 10 fatal shooting of political activist and commentator Charlie Kirk, some Republican officials nationwide encouraged Americans to report people who criticized Kirk. Schorn is one of the people who has received scrutiny.
South Dakota university drops effort to fire professor for Charlie Kirk post

On the evening of Sept. 12, Schorn published a more than 700-word criticism of Kirk to a personal Facebook account. The post included criticism of Kirk’s views on race, guns, religion and more.
On Sept. 30, Republican gubernatorial candidate Toby Doeden, of Aberdeen, published a social media post calling attention to Schorn’s writings and accusing him of  “indoctrination and radicalization of our young people.”
“Under my leadership,” Doeden wrote, people like Schorn “will have no place in the classroom!”
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Doeden said taxpayers should not fund Schorn’s views.
“This is about taxpayers’ money, plain and simple,” Doeden said. “If Mr. Schorn wants to open a business with his own money and speak this way, that is his right as an American.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, another Republican running for governor, has not called for firings in reaction to comments about Kirk. He told South Dakota Searchlight that he has disagreed with many of Schorn’s comments.
“It’s important to remember, though, that stupid comments from professors are generally protected by the First Amendment when issued as private citizens, rather than state employees,” Johnson said.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not yet said whether he’ll be a candidate to keep his job next year. He declined to comment about Schorn, but a spokesperson said Rhoden “takes open and civil discourse on our college campuses very seriously.”
Rhoden was previously involved in another controversy about statements by a university professor.
In a post to a personal social media account within hours of Kirk’s death, University of South Dakota art professor Michael Hook used profanity and derogatory terms to describe Kirk while questioning the veracity of Kirk supporters’ concerns about political violence.
Two days later, candidate for governor and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, posted to social media about Hook.
“I immediately reached out to USD President Sheila Gestring and called on the professor to be fired,” Hansen wrote.

Two hours after Hansen posted that, Rhoden posted to social media that “the Board of Regents intends to FIRE this University of South Dakota professor, and I’m glad.”
“We must not send the message to our kids that this is acceptable public discourse. We need more Charlie Kirks on campus and less hatred like this,” Rhoden wrote.
The state Board of Regents and the university placed Hook on administrative leave with an intent to fire him. He sued, and a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 24, requiring the university to reinstate him pending further proceedings in the case.
The judge found that Hook had spoken as a citizen on a matter of public concern, which is a form of constitutionally protected speech; that the state failed to produce evidence that his speech had an adverse impact on the efficiency of university operations; and that Hook had a fair chance of prevailing in his lawsuit by showing the actions taken against him were a form of retaliation that could chill protected speech.
On Oct. 3, Hook’s attorney released a letter from USD President Sheila Gestring informing Hook he would no longer be fired.
“We have taken into consideration your remorse for the post, your past record of service, and the university’s interest in efficient operations,” the letter said.
Hook issued a statement that said in part, “I hope the state now understands that the First Amendment prohibits it from punishing anyone for speech about public issues — no matter how much state or national leaders or others disagree with it.”
Schorn, who studies authoritarian governments and human rights, said he views the threats of termination as part of a broader, national effort to chill speech and control thought.
“If universities can’t tolerate uncomfortable ideas, then we’re no longer educating, we’re indoctrinating,” Schorn said. “And that’s exactly what these politicians claim to oppose.”

Photo by TimothyJ via FlickrA proposed south Georgia chicken plant that could be the state’s largest poultry operation is on hold after a Coffee County judge found it would likely harm locals’ health and property values and damage the nearby Satilla River.
The proposal called for 60 chicken houses, each holding more than 25,000 birds, which are projected to produce at least 40,000 pounds of litter roughly every eight weeks – about how long they will be on site – and up to 450,000 carcasses on the site per year. 
“According to Defendants, this waste, including dead carcasses, will be periodically hauled off site but will sit in the houses for months before being sold,” wrote Coffee County Superior Court Judge J. Kelly Brooks in his order halting the project while a legal trial continues. “Defendants could not name the hauler or describe the method or frequency of disposal in any manner. Nor could they identify any odor or dust suppression methods to be employed.”
The plaintiffs, a group of landowners near the proposed site, had a variety of reasons for not wanting the operation to start up, mostly having to do with not wanting to be exposed to chicken feces, rotting bird corpses and bacterial runoff.
One local farm owner testified that she and one of her grandchildren are severe asthmatics and she worries about the effects of breathing in particulates from the plant.
Former GOP state Rep. Chuck Sims, representing his company, Sims Funeral Home, testified that he “does not want attendees to be bombarded with pathogen-laden dust and the smell of chicken feces and corpses as they are mourning.”
Other testimony indicated that the project could harm the Satilla River for miles, and potentially all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, and that property owners could see the value of their land drop by up to 30%. 
Brooks also criticized defendants for not making any attempts to contact neighbors or engage with the community about the project.
“The evidence clearly showed that Defendants pursued this project quietly and avoided community engagement until forced to respond through these proceedings,” Brooks wrote.
“The court is not without empathy for potential financial injury to Defendants,” he added. “However, such injury is largely self-inflicted.”
George Lott, an attorney with Atlanta-based Evans Bowers representing the plaintiffs, said a grassroots effort helped bring the project to light.
“Our clients had no idea that this was going forward until the project was already several weeks or several months in the works,” he said. “And it’s almost hard to describe all the efforts they’ve made to try to get information. They held town hall meetings, they contacted county commissioners, they contacted other government regulators, entities, to try to figure out what’s being proposed, who was proposing it, what work was going to be done, and then they even tried to contact some of the defendants directly and couldn’t make any progress. And so they really didn’t know the full scope until right before we filed the lawsuit, I think.”
Kasey Sturm, an attorney with the law firm Weissman representing the defendants, said that’s not accurate.
“I don’t think that’s a fair characterization,” she said. “The property is zoned agricultural. It has widely been acknowledged that chicken farming is an acceptable practice in agricultural land. And again, these family farmers obtained the requisite authority both from the state and from the county to construct and operate chicken houses on their respective farms.”
Sturm also rejected the characterization of the project as the largest poultry operation in the state.
“This is five separate farms, each with 12 houses, which is common and consistent with poultry across the state, consistent with what you see in Coffee County,” she said. “Coffee County is number 15 as far as counties in the state of Georgia for poultry production; this is a very common occurrence in Coffee County.”
Brooks’ order puts the project on hold until the court holds a final trial. Lott said it’s still too early to guess how long that could take.
“Every court is different. Sometimes it’s a matter of months. Sometimes it takes years to get to the final trial. So it’s hard to predict the timing of all of this, but in the interim, until the court holds a final hearing, there is an injunction that prevents further construction on site.”
Sturm said the farmers are evaluating their options and are concerned the ruling could discourage poultry businesses from coming to Georgia.
“We’re disappointed with the ruling,” she said. “We believe it’s contrary to the evidence that was presented at the hearing. The ruling has somewhat of a chilling effect on the marketability of title in the state of Georgia, such that farmers now need to look at when they go and sell property, are they going to be hauled into court for the potential future use of that property by somebody they sell it to? That’s a concern.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderVoting rights advocates in Meriwether County have filed a lawsuit challenging the districts drawn for local county commission seats, which they say illegally dilute the voting power of Black residents under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court Thursday, alleges that district maps enacted in 2022 have contributed to the lack of Black representation on the board of commissioners, despite the fact that Black voters make up “a substantial percentage” of the county’s population. The Georgia NAACP, which according to the lawsuit has roughly 100 members who reside in the county, is one of the plaintiffs.
“We will not stand by and watch Black voters in Georgia be stripped of their right to fair representation,” Georgia NAACP President Gerald Griggs said in a statement, calling the maps “a direct attack on this community’s political power.”
Meriwether County is located about 50 miles south of Atlanta. Its five-member board of commissioners, which is tasked with adopting county policies, establishing a budget and maintaining roads, bridges and other infrastructure, is currently all white.
Hani Mirza, who serves as director of the power and democracy program at Advancement Project, a civil rights organization involved with the case, said the new maps have “had an immediate impact on Black representation at the county level in Meriwether County.” 
The new maps, the lawsuit says, were adopted over the objections of the county’s then-only Black commissioner, who is no longer in office. 
In one district, Black representation has hovered around 50% before and after redistricting, but in another, the Black voting age population decreased from about 45% to less than 30%. None of the three Black candidates who have run for a county commission since the new maps took effect have been successful, according to the lawsuit. 
One remedy proposed in the complaint would redraw the maps to create two new Black-majority districts for the county commission. One district would span the north and central parts of the county, including towns like Greenville, Woodbury and Lone Oak, while the other would include southern Meriwether County areas like Manchester and Warm Springs.
Rev. James Clements, a Black Meriwether County resident and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said that the board of commissioners once included two Black members, and described the hopelessness members of the Black community feel as a result of the loss of representation on the commission.
Now some Black residents he’s talked to, Clements said in an interview with the Recorder, “don’t feel the need to even go to a commissioner meeting, because they don’t feel that their voice is going to be heard.”
Clements ran as a Democrat for a seat on the commission last year, losing to the Republican candidate by only 12 votes. But he says his involvement in the lawsuit “has nothing to do with” his own candidacy.
If a white candidate wins in a majority-minority district, “that’s because they’re the better candidate,” he said. “But we’d just like the opportunity to be able to be represented at the board of commissioners’ office.”
Meriwether Board of Elections and Election Supervisor Patty Threadgill did not respond to requests for comment.
However, the voting rights law that the lawsuit hinges on may itself be on shaky ground. Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to rehear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case filed by white voters in Louisiana challenging the 2024 congressional district maps that included two Black-majority districts. Voting rights advocates say the Supreme Court’s ruling has the potential to overturn a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering that dilutes minority voting power.
Mirza with the Advancement Project said he is monitoring the Supreme Court case.
“We’re, like others, watching to see what happens and will respond accordingly,” Mirza said.

Reporting Highlights

Serious Charge: Drivers are rarely charged with murder in fatal car crashes unless they have aggravating factors — such as past DUIs or excessive speed.
Uncommon Plea Deal: Unlike most people facing these charges in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, this defendant was not offered a plea deal for a lesser charge.
Unusual Suspect: Years after the crash, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on why it went so differently than similar cases — and what they believe was bias.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When 19-year-old Jorge Ruiz walked into the Autauga County Jail in handcuffs on Oct. 28, 2018, he wasn’t a typical suspect. He was out of place and in big trouble in a deeply conservative part of Alabama.
That morning, he’d been driving about 70 miles per hour in a 55 zone when he crossed the center line of a two-lane rural highway. His Ford pickup collided head-on with a Honda Civic, killing the woman behind the wheel. Paramedics took Ruiz to the hospital, where a blood test found a trace amount of alcohol. At just 0.016, it was below the legal threshold for intoxication.
But rather than charging him with manslaughter, which typically would be the most extreme charge brought under the circumstances, police went further. They arrested him for murder.

To support such a murder charge, prosecutors are supposed to show that a defendant’s conduct displays “extreme indifference” — behavior so reckless that someone is likely to die, as when a person fires a gun into a crowd or steers a boat into a group of swimmers. Suspects charged with murder after car crashes often are documented to have blood alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit and 10 times the level found in Ruiz’s blood, according to a review of Alabama cases from the last 20 years by ProPublica. Many others had prior DUIs or were driving 100 miles per hour or more. In this case, the suspect had a clean criminal history and wasn’t even going fast enough to be ticketed for aggravated speeding.
Ruiz’s trial attorney said that as soon as he started talking to the district attorney’s office, the case felt different. Across the three counties in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, only a handful of people have been charged with murder for a car accident in the span of a decade — and most wound up taking a plea deal for a lesser charge.
But this time around, the prosecutor’s offer could hardly be considered a deal at all: The teenager would have to plead guilty to murder, and it would be blind plea, meaning he would have to hope for mercy from the court in his sentencing. “In my 30 years of practicing law, I have never been offered a deal like that,” Ruiz’s court-appointed lawyer, Richard Lively, said.
The lead prosecutor eventually budged, but only a little. He wouldn’t reduce the charge, but he would recommend that the teenager spend 30 years in prison.
That’s longer than any other sentence handed down since at least 2004 for a car crash fatality in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, which includes Autauga, Chilton and Elmore counties. A man who fled the scene of a fatal crash — and had a 0.09 blood alcohol level nine hours later — received a 15-year sentence in 2017. A woman who had three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system received 23 years in 2007 after she killed a University of Alabama student.
For defendants who were teenagers when they caused fatal car accidents, the courts can be even more lenient. In 2012, a Madison County judge granted youthful offender status to a man who was 19 when he was charged with murder for a drunk driving crash that killed a high school sophomore in Huntsville. The driver, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.15, was sentenced to a year in jail and two on probation.
Lively had a hard time squaring his client’s charges with the results of his blood test and recorded speed. Alabama’s murder statute does not require a driver to be legally intoxicated, and people have faced murder charges for killing someone by racing or fleeing police. But neither applied here. Lively reasoned that for murder to fit, the teenager would have had to be intentionally driving into oncoming traffic.
He thought his client could beat the charge and told him not to plead guilty. Years later, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on what was so different about it — and on one fact in particular that they believed eclipsed all the others.
He was a Mexican immigrant.
The case against Ruiz was, as one legal expert put it, “a perfect storm of horrible facts.”
The night before the accident, he stayed up late after drinking at a music festival in Birmingham. At the scene of the crash, police found beer cans in his truck. He was in the country on a temporary work visa and did not have a driver’s license. He spoke little English, relying on his 17-year-old cousin to translate his Miranda rights and the string of questions from police.
The only reason Ruiz was in Autauga County was to visit his extended family after finishing a monthslong job in Georgia and South Carolina clearing brush from power lines. He was days away from returning to Mexico.
The woman he killed was named Marlena Hayes. She was a 29-year-old nurse who’d just finished the night shift at Prattville Baptist Hospital. She wasn’t even supposed to be working at that time. She’d planned to see her brother perform that weekend with the marching band at the University of West Alabama. In the end, though, she took the shift as a favor to a colleague.

Newspapers and TV stations in central Alabama quickly picked up the story. Some referred to Ruiz as an illegal immigrant even though he’d been in the U.S. on a six-month H-2B visa, which are approved when employers can’t find enough American workers. One of those articles appeared in the Montgomery Advertiser, the largest newspaper in the area.
When Lively was assigned to the case, he felt compelled to show that his client had been in the U.S. legally. Ruiz’s visa had only lapsed when he was in jail. Lively tracked down the Montgomery Advertiser reporter at the Autauga County courthouse to show him that Ruiz’s visa had been valid when he was arrested. But even after that, the newspaper failed to acknowledge that he was in the country legally at the time of the crash. “The Montgomery Advertiser stands behind our reporting,” the newspaper said in a statement released through its parent company, Gannett.
In the years leading up to Ruiz’s arrest, Alabama had established itself as a particularly unwelcoming place for foreigners. In 2011, then-Gov. Robert Bentley signed a bill that criminalized everyday activities like transporting, employing and renting homes to undocumented immigrants.
At the time, historians and legal experts worried the law could usher in a new era of racial injustice similar to Jim Crow that would be enforced by the police and courts. But the impact of the immigration law remains largely unknown because Alabama prisons don’t collect ethnicity data and therefore don’t know how many inmates are Hispanic. In 2013, the state agreed not to enforce most of the provisions as part of a lawsuit.
“The HB 56 legislation brought nativism and xenophobia into the political mainstream in Alabama” wrote historian Raymond Mohl. At the height of the debate over the law, a congressman from north Alabama said that to prevent illegal immigration to the state, he would do “anything short of shooting them.”
Back then, those harsh policies made Alabama an outlier. But with the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, the state’s positions started going mainstream. Alabama even supplied one of the foremost architects of Trump’s first-term immigration policy: U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a fierce champion of border crackdowns, was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general.
Ruiz was arrested nearly two years into Trump’s first term. At the time, Alabama was growing more red even as a blue wave nationally elected dozens of Democrats to Congress. In Alabama, Republicans swept statewide office that year and expanded their majority in the Legislature.
Some members of Ruiz’s extended family had started moving to Alabama from Mexico nearly 15 years earlier and stayed in the area even after the political winds turned against them. Sandra Ruiz, his 17-year-old cousin, moved from Texas to Autauga County at age 2 and had lived near Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery, nearly all her life. She knew that some of her neighbors could be ignorant of, or even hostile to, people from Mexico. She and her family were afraid for Jorge Ruiz when he was arrested and followed the police to the station. Investigators allowed the high school senior to translate their questions and Ruiz’s responses.
A judge granted Ruiz bond in March 2019, four months after he was jailed. Ruiz’s family members in Alabama sold tamales and organized a raffle of an ornate belt buckle to raise funds for bail. They posted the money to free him.
And they began to wait.
In the weeks and months leading up to Ruiz’s trial, Judge Bill Lewis made several decisions that, according to Ruiz’s lawyer, put his client at a disadvantage.
One of the first things Lewis did was revoke Ruiz’s bond. Because of a technicality, Ruiz’s family never recovered the $5,000 they’d paid to get him out of jail. The news coverage that followed the decision sparked intense, and often misinformed, debate online about the case, and Lively worried that bias would affect potential jurors. Not long after Ruiz’s bond was revoked, the judge got a letter in the mail from a local resident. The writer thanked him and asked Lewis to “do everything in your power to get justice for Marlena.” The letter went on to describe Ruiz as “in this country illegally” and “operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol.”
About a week later, Lewis denied Ruiz’s application for youthful offender status. That meant he would not be eligible for a sentence capped at three years. Lewis did not respond to a list of questions from ProPublica, including one about not granting Ruiz youthful offender status.
But as the trial neared, Lewis took several steps to attempt to keep bias out of the courtroom. He gave special instructions to the prosecution and the defense, barring any mention of Ruiz’s immigration status and directing attorneys involved in the case to call him “George.”
The judge’s efforts couldn’t erase the obvious difference between Ruiz and almost everyone else in the courtroom: the language barrier. “Longtime courthouse observers don’t recall a case in Prattville where an interpreter was used at trial,” the Montgomery Advertiser reported.
The district attorney had charged Ruiz under the reckless murder section of the statute, reserved for offenders who unintentionally cause a death. Courts have found that driving without a license, a misdemeanor that in Alabama carries a fine of $10 to $100, doesn’t constitute underlying recklessness for charges like manslaughter or murder. Prosecutors only briefly brought up at Ruiz’s trial that he did not have a license. What made the case amount to murder, the prosecutor said throughout the case, was that Ruiz was both speeding and had crossed the center line.
Ruiz’s use of alcohol also played a central role in the trial, even though he hadn’t been charged with DUI — and even though the prosecutors conceded that the evidence didn’t support that charge. A toxicologist testified that almost four hours had passed between the crash and the blood test at the hospital. He said the average elimination rate for alcohol is 0.015 percentage points an hour. That testimony suggested Ruiz’s blood alcohol level would have been higher than 0.07 at the time of the accident.
If the prosecutors could scientifically confirm that figure, it would have been enough to charge Ruiz with DUI because the legal intoxication threshold is lower for underage drivers. But such estimates have been described as unreliable by some scientists and legal experts, with one calling them no better than a “wild guess.” Some states have imposed higher bars than Alabama for the admission of such evidence, and at least one, Massachusetts, doesn’t allow it at all if the blood alcohol reading was, like Ruiz’s, below 0.03.
Lively produced no expert to dispute the toxicologist. In fact, he called only one witness, Ruiz’s date the night of the festival, who testified that Ruiz rode with her to her apartment after the festival, at around 1:30 a.m., and slept on the couch until he left at around 5 a.m.
Lively said in his closing argument that the evidence failed to show that Ruiz’s behavior was so brazenly dangerous that it amounted to murder.
“This was a person who was driving home and fell asleep behind the wheel,” Lively said.
Then-Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson said there was no evidence Ruiz fell asleep. “In Alabama, we recognize that you can do something so dangerous that it could kill somebody, and you should realize what you’re doing is that dangerous,” he said during closing arguments. “I submit to you that anyone’s life was in danger, and therefore it was reckless murder.”
Jurors were instructed that, as an alternative to murder, they also could consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. They deliberated for less than an hour.
The foreman announced guilty verdicts on three counts: minor in possession of alcohol, driving without a license and murder.
Three weeks later, everyone gathered again for the sentencing. Robinson invited members of Hayes’ family to speak about their loss.
The family, along with friends, had come to every hearing. Hayes’ mother, Laura Liveoak, had spoken out on social media about her grief, describing how her daughter had texted her right before she left work that morning, asking what the weather was like. Liveoak said in a Facebook video: “It’s hard to be the parent of a victim, knowing that she’ll never be a mother. I’ll never be a grandmother to the sweet little redheaded kids that she probably would have had.” She declined to comment for this story.
Liveoak told the judge how much her daughter loved being a nurse: so much that she spent some of her days off visiting patients. She’d recently bought a house in a nearby town, Deatsville, and adopted two German shepherds who became the center of her world. She’d texted her mom right before she left work that morning. Her last message was about her dogs.

Then it was Ruiz’s turn. He spoke for the first time in court.
“I want to say that I am sorry to the family,” Ruiz said. “I wouldn’t have wished for this to happen. I wish that this would have only been a dream.”
Lewis peered down from the bench at Ruiz.
“This is America,” Lewis said. “It’s the greatest country in the world and we have the right to trial in this country. I would never penalize you for exercising that right, but Mr. Lively talked about acceptance of responsibility, contrition, remorse. I haven’t seen any of that from you.”
He sentenced Ruiz to the maximum possible punishment, longer even than the 50 years requested by prosecutors: 99 years.
The court went quiet. Even the prosecutor was shocked.
Years later, Robinson remembered that moment. “That was not something that I had expected,” he said.
In 2023, four years after the sentencing, a human rights lawyer from Mexico reached out to the Southern Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit law center in Atlanta that focuses on criminal justice. He let them know that the Mexican Consulate had been following Ruiz’s case from the time he was arrested through the slow-moving appeals process. His 99-year sentence had shocked them, and they wanted to find a lawyer in the U.S. who could steer the increasingly complicated appeal.
Ruiz’s family had cobbled together money for a private attorney, who filed motions to challenge his conviction and sentence. But they had run out of funds. Ruiz was preparing to represent himself when the attorneys from the center stepped in.
“I was like, ‘We need to help this kid,’” SCHR attorney Paulina Lucio-Maymon said. “Otherwise, he’s just gonna end up forgotten by the system.”
The Mexican Consulate connected Lucio-Maymon and her colleague Michael Admirand with family from Prattville, who in turn connected the attorneys with family in Ruiz’s hometown, José María Pino Suárez, in the Mexican state of Durango. Many in the small community knew Ruiz. As a young boy, he had helped his grandfather work a shared plot of farmland and manage his livestock. He dropped out after middle school to support his family and got his visa to come to the U.S. in the spring of 2018. He needed to make more money after his mother’s unexpected death.
“He was always trying to make sure everyone was taken care of,” said his cousin, Sandra Ruiz.
In the U.S., he was part of an all-immigrant crew of temporary visa workers employed by a contractor for the power company. The team trudged through Georgia and South Carolina backcountry, their feet snagging on roots and vines as they cleared vegetation from power lines. They often walked for 10 to 12 hours a day while carrying heavy canisters of weed-killing chemicals, and Ruiz suffered heat stroke twice, one of Ruiz’s fellow workers testified in an appeal hearing. Workers wore out their shoes every eight days, the worker said.

Ruiz wanted to spend his last few weeks in the U.S. visiting family in Prattville before returning to Mexico. He missed his daughter, Noeli, and had begun making plans for her third birthday.
None of that history had been presented at his sentencing hearing. His attorney also failed to highlight his clean criminal record in Mexico.
In September 2019, less than a month after he handed down that 99-year sentence, Lewis had issued an unusual order. He removed Lively from the case despite there being no motion seeking his removal. Lewis determined Ruiz had received inadequate representation.
Lewis cited an offhand comment Lively made at the sentencing hearing. In response to the judge admonishing Ruiz for not being contrite, Lively told the judge that the decision to take Ruiz’s case to trial “may be more of a reflection of my bad advice to him than his own acceptance of responsibility.” Lewis wrote that he saw that as an admission that Lively was questioning his own representation of Ruiz. (Lively later told ProPublica he was trying to “deflect some of Judge Lewis’ criticism of Jorge onto me” and lamented how “that one sentence has been used as a cudgel against me and a tool to scapegoat me in this case.”)
In the hearings and filings that followed, Lewis continued to express concerns about the information that had not been presented at trial or sentencing.
“The Court, when rendering a sentence in this case should have as much information as possible,” Lewis wrote in a more recent order. “Mr. Lively failed to provide any, despite having access to many different sources of information that could have affected the Defendant’s sentence.”
Lively did provide some evidence at Ruiz’s sentencing, calling his aunt and cousin to testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later rejected a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him.
In a statement to ProPublica, Lively wrote that he believed he competently defended Ruiz. He said that he only called one trial witness because he felt the state had not proven his client’s guilt. He pointed to the state’s experts, who testified that Ruiz had a very low level of alcohol in his system and drifted slowly into oncoming traffic, which, according to Lively, showed Ruiz did not intentionally jerk the car across the center line. “The most powerful witness is one that is called by the opposition who proves your case,” Lively wrote.
He also described the case as “the most traumatic” he’s encountered in his 30 years as an attorney. “I have made the law my life’s work, and Jorge’s case caused me to question almost everything I believed about the legal system,” he wrote.
When Lucio-Maymon and Admirand first took on Ruiz’s case, they appealed both his murder conviction and his 99-year sentence. Lewis rejected their challenge of Ruiz’s conviction but agreed the sentence deserved another look.
To make their case for a shorter sentence, Ruiz’s attorneys compiled information about other fatal car crash cases. His former attorneys had appealed his conviction to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and lost. The one notable dissent on the panel of judges was penned by Republican Judge J. William Cole, who wrote that the facts did not support a murder conviction.
“Ruiz had consumed alcohol before the accident, but he was not determined to be legally intoxicated, nor was he charged with driving under the influence of alcohol,” Cole wrote. “Although he crossed to the wrong side of the road, there was no evidence that he was racing or driving in a grossly wanton manner.”
Admirand and Lucio-Maymon looked at the four cases cited in the decision to uphold his conviction. The drivers in those cases had blood alcohol levels that ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 — from double to nearly quadruple the level of criminal intoxication. Their sentences ranged from 12 to 25 years in prison.
The attorneys created a simple graph that compared those sentences and blood alcohol levels. Although Ruiz had the lowest amount of alcohol in his system, his sentence was by far the longest.
After Lewis granted a new sentencing hearing, Admirand and Lucio-Maymon felt hopeful. That disparity — along with testimony from Ruiz’s friends and family in Mexico — could help sway the judge toward mercy, they believed. They said they even started talking with the district attorney’s office with the goal of making a deal, though Robinson said he remembered those conversations differently. He recalled that he agreed to listen to evidence about Ruiz’s background but wouldn’t consider reducing the charge and would be hard-pressed to recommend less than 50 years.
“They did initially express some openness to discussion in this case,” Admirand said. “And then something changed.”
Although Lewis had presided over Ruiz’s trial and granted him a resentencing hearing, he was not behind the bench when Ruiz was set to be resentenced in 2024. By then, Lewis had been appointed to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals.
The case was transferred to Sibley Reynolds, who had retired from the bench but still took cases as needed. When Admirand and Lucio-Maymon arrived early on Aug. 14, 2024, to prepare, they found the judge sitting in the courtroom, paging through a purple binder they had never seen before. It contained pictures of Hayes and letters from friends, family members and even a few local officials.
Each of the dozens of letters urged the judge to uphold Ruiz’s 99-year sentence. Prosecutors asked the judge for 50 years. Lucio-Maymon and Admirand, citing several sentences from cases across the 19th Circuit Court, were seeking 10 years.
Admirand said he watched as Reynolds carried the binder with him to the bench. The hearing he oversaw was short but eventful. At one point, Ruiz addressed Hayes’ family.
“I am profoundly sorry for having caused you this pain,” he said. “I want to say I’m sorry or forgive me, the way I have asked God to do every day during the almost six years.”
Admirand presented all the evidence he believed had been missing from Ruiz’s first sentencing hearing in 2019. He told the judge about the cases they had found in the same judicial district with sentences that ranged from one to 25 years. And he presented mitigating factors — witnesses who testified about Ruiz’s character and work ethic.
His attorneys also played a series of videos of family members in Mexico, accompanied by dramatic music.
When Robinson, who had been elected district attorney in 2022, started to make his argument against Ruiz, he invoked a patriotic anthem as a sort of rebuttal. He said the victim’s family was ready to move on and that he was going to make a case for them “courtesy of the red, white and blue.”
It was a reference to the title of the Toby Keith song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” which includes lyrics like, “We’ll put a boot in your ass, it’s the American way.” Robinson would later tell ProPublica the comment was taken out of context and was meant as a critique of the music in the video, which he described as “manipulative.”
Shortly after, Hayes’ mother asked the judge to uphold the original sentence.
“I’m asking for the 99 years that Judge Lewis saw fit to give,” she said. “Marlena’s life is worth that and so much more.”
At the end of the hearing, the judge announced his decision: He would reduce Ruiz’s sentence to 50 years.
He didn’t offer an explanation for why he chose what’s still an unusually long sentence. Admirand suspected the reason might be found in the purple binder. He objected to the judge considering it without the defense having seen it. He then asked for a copy of the material.
“I mean, it’s literally letters from the victim’s family,” said Assistant District Attorney Mandy Johnson in response to the objection.
When Admirand read it right after the hearing, he found much more than that, including notes from local public officials and incorrect information about the case. He said that, more alarmingly, there were letters that included language he considered biased. One letter said that if Ruiz was released early and deported, he would surely return to the U.S.
“He will again commit crimes,” the letter said. “He will again be a draw on our judicial system and society itself. He will once again be an unnecessary threat to all our lives, including yours.”
“Fry him!” demanded another one.

The binder presented an opportunity to challenge what Admirand had come to believe was an underlying bias that permeated the case from the first moments after the crash, when a state trooper threatened to take Ruiz to jail if he did not speak English. In September 2024, he and Lucio-Maymon filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the letters contained improper references to Ruiz’s nationality, including racially derogatory claims. In February, the Mexican Consulate filed an amicus brief in support of the appeal, only the second time in five years it has done that in a criminal case in the United States.
“Ruiz’s equal protection rights were violated from the moment this prosecution began,” the appeal said. “From his earliest interactions with law enforcement through the resentencing proceedings, Ruiz was treated more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race. The Court should remedy this injustice.”
In June, Ruiz’s attorneys identified another 17 car crash cases over 15 years that were heard in the 19th Circuit Court. Most defendants received sentences of less than 15 years in prison, even in cases involving multiple fatalities or high blood alcohol levels. Only one, Ruiz, had a sentence longer than 25 years. Robinson argued those cases were different, though not because of the defendant’s race. Defendants in most of them had accepted plea deals. He did not acknowledge that all of those plea deals were more lenient than the one offered to Ruiz.
Lewis did not respond to questions, including ones about alleged bias in the case. In response to ProPublica’s questions, Robinson wrote that neither he nor the district attorney’s office “treated Jorge Ruiz more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race.”
Though the district attorney’s office did not charge Ruiz with DUI, Robinson wrote that alcohol “was illegally consumed at a rate much higher than legally permissible for Ruiz to be operating a vehicle.” He also wrote, “I do not assess cases using a least common denominator approach. I do my best to evaluate them based on a totality of the circumstances approach.”
In August, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals asked for more information from Reynolds about his reasoning behind the 50-year sentence. Admirand and Lucio-Maymon have asked the court to take Reynolds off the case, arguing that he improperly reviewed the purple binder material. Reynolds did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.
Hayes’ family members have been outspoken about their loss. At every hearing, they tick off the milestones Hayes has missed. Her brother’s graduation. Her sister’s wedding. The births of nieces and nephews.
Ruiz’s family members are quietly marking off their own list. His daughter’s kindergarten graduation, her First Communion. The 9-year-old still doesn’t quite comprehend where he has gone.
Ruiz has learned a little English but still struggles with the language. He said through his attorneys that he’s never been able to adequately convey how bad he feels about the accident. It’s not just the language barrier, but also that his role in Hayes’ death left him so distraught that he felt like “my life didn’t matter anymore.”
Still, the hearing last year that reduced his sentence kindled some optimism. He said that when he first faced the prospect of 99 years behind bars, the only thing he could think about was never seeing his daughter again. After the hearing, his outlook changed.
“That gave me back hope that one day I’ll be able to see my family again,” Ruiz said.

Dubbed by fans and peers as the King of Reality TV, the Detroit-born producer has built franchises that travel beyond the coasts. His “Love & Marriage” franchise has turned Huntsville, Alabama, Detroit and Washington into must-see television along with “Family Empire: Houston.” His other hit “Belle Collective” put Jackson, Mississippi, on the cultural map and returned with a new season this month on OWN.
As a former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” producer, King is showing that compelling stories thrive wherever real people live, love and grind. Through his company, Kingdom Reign Entertainment, he says more than 60% of OWN’s original programming carries his imprint, crediting the network’s top executives such as Oprah Winfrey, Tina Perry and Drew Tappon for backing his vision.
Beyond television, King has expanded his reach with the popular podcast “Reality with the King” and on-camera hosting, cementing his status as both creator and voice of the culture.
In a recent conversation with The Associated Press, King opened up about independence, building generational wealth, navigating racism and homophobia as an openly gay Black man. He also touches on how he feels about being called the “Black Andy Cohen,” a nod to the “Real Housewives” executive producer and late-night host who became Bravo’s on-air face.
AP: What does the “King of Reality TV” mean to you?
KING: It solidifies my place in this business of unscripted television. Having a successful production company, Kingdom Reign Television, having the No. 1 show on Oprah Winfrey’s Network, “Love and Marriage Huntsville,” to a number one podcast, “Reality with the King,” so all those things are underneath me, my brand and my empire. The title means a lot to me and my brand. The audience understands I’m multifaceted and multitalented. It holds a lot of weight, but I’m definitely somebody that understands the assignment.
AP: Why is ownership such a priority for you?
KING: In our business, unfortunately, you create a show and you’re at the mercy of the network, which is just our business. And that’s just the way things are, right? You do the work and once you sell the show to the network, you don’t own the show anymore. I’m all about ownership and the fact that if I put in the sweat equity, then I want all of the profits. I want all of the margins coming to me because I did the work, I created the idea. I found the cast. I developed the show. I want to own everything that I do, and that’s where my vision is right now.
The beauty of my podcast is the fact that I own it. No one can tell me what to do with it. Those opportunities of ownership is fantastic because you’re able to really create your own destiny and look for partnerships that makes sense versus doing the archaic way of this business that I just don’t have the desire to do anymore.
AP: How have you navigated systemic barriers?
KING: I have seen it all, I’ve been through it all: homophobia, racism. I’ve seen that all of my life, personal and professional. However, for me, I never allowed that to be my disadvantage. I found ways to make that my superpower. I found ways to make sure that I stood up for myself and for my people in meetings, in conversations, and inappropriate discussions where shade was thrown very subliminally. I allowed myself to be a disrupter in a very different way.

I didn’t feel the need to be super outspoken in the moment and made a scene out of it. Because I knew that if I did that, I wouldn’t be asked back to do the job. I knew to stand up for myself and my community in a way that was digestible to them. But I always knew that you have learned a valuable lesson, and you take these conversations that are happening around you, and you allow that to fuel you into being an agent of change in other situations.
AP: What are the three keys to building a successful reality show?
KING: No. 1, the cast. A show lives or dies by the cast. You got to find a great cast. No. 2 is what’s the angle? If I did a show about a group of Black people in Atlanta … oh right, kind of seen it. But if I do a show about Black couples in Huntsville. Well, that piques my interest. Tell me more about it. Find the angle that isn’t already out there. No. 3, authenticity is key. Have an authentic group of people who want to share their lives.
The three things that don’t work:
First is a group of cast members who do not want to share their reality. You’re losing. Two, an angle that is familiar. I get pitched sometimes, “I’m going do a show about X, Y and Z.” And I’m like, “That’s already on the air. There’s nothing special about that. Take another big swing at the idea.” Find out what’s missing on television and create that yourself. Don’t create another copy of a show that’s already on the air. And No. 3, fakeness. Oh my gosh, the audience can spot a fake. I can spot a fake.
AP: Why did you set “Love & Marriage” in Huntsville and “Belle Collective” in Jackson?
KING: I wanted to tap into a market that I felt was underserved and just wasn’t getting their just due. I wanted to tell Black stories in inner cities and towns that aren’t prevalent like a LA, New York, Miami. I wanted to be able to show the world that these people do exist, and they should not be forgotten about. Not a lot of people, including me, have heard of Huntsville until I met some of the people and I’m like, “Oh, you guys have a great story.”
AP: How do you feel about being referred to as the Black version of Andy Cohen?
KING: I want people to really pay attention to the individualism that we both offer in this community of unscripted. For me, when it comes to my legacy, I feel very confident that people are now seeing the difference between (him) and I, and they’re now seeing the amount of work I’m doing with my podcast, my YouTube channel, the work that I’m doing with creating shows in different parts of the world that are untapped. They’re seeing more of that. I want them to keep watching because it’s only going to get better.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08160052/AP25235138539127.jpg,,,2025-10-11 08:57:06.935387

Idaho DEQ didn’t rewrite the rulebook on assessing cancer risks; in fact, it used the EPA’s. The EPA has a conservative, gold standard methodology for assessing health risk. It’s been used for decades, and is designed to be protective of sensitive populations, like pregnant women and children.
Using EPA and Idaho DEQ’s standard formula, regulators considered the project’s maximum possible arsenic emissions if the mine operates all day, every day, for 16 straight years, which is an extremely conservative assumption that cannot in fact occur under actual operational constraints.
Nonetheless, based on this conservative assumption, Idaho DEQ calculated the lifetime additional cancer risk from project emissions to be four in one million or about 1 in 240,000; Idaho’s protective standard is 1 in 100,000, which means the excess cancer risk from the project is 41% less than what Idaho law requires. To further put that in perspective, the odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime are 1 in 15,000.
The conclusion? Emissions from the Stibnite Gold Project do not pose unacceptable excess cancer risk for anyone.
Claims that Idaho somehow bent the rules to accommodate the project were tested in a full administrative hearing before an independent hearing officer, during which multiple toxicologists, scientists and permit engineers testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer concluded that Idaho correctly applied the risk assessment methodology and wholly rejected litigants’ claims. The Idaho DEQ Board unanimously upheld that decision.
Zooming out, while this debate has focused on permitting and risk methodology, Idahoans deserve to understand the broader picture and why this project matters:
The Stibnite Gold Project will supply the only American reserve of the critical mineral antimony, which is controlled by China. We need antimony for our national defense, our military needs it for artillery, munitions, and equipment. We also need it for civilian and renewable energy uses, including batteries and semiconductors.
The United States sets the gold standard for environmental regulations while China has terrible environmental practices. The choice is to mine antimony and other minerals in an environmentally responsible manner in the U.S. or rely on China and others who will increase global pollution through their mining practices.
What’s more, this project will actually remediate the environment and eliminate toxins polluting the environment today. The Stibnite Gold Project sits on an abandoned mine site, where one ton of arsenic currently flows into the river every single year. This project will pick up and reprocess 10 million tons of mine waste and tailings, get heavy metals out of Idaho rivers, and make the environment cleaner and safer for everyone.
We must encourage projects like this in order to address the waste from abandoned mining sites that plague the West.
Protecting people and the environment is the core mission of environmental regulators. EPA standards are deliberately conservative, independent experts vet the data, and this project was only approved after demonstrating it would protect both human health and the environment. The Stibnite Gold Project doesn’t clash with MAHA — it embodies it.
Suggesting otherwise isn’t advocacy, it’s fearmongering. Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth. On all counts, the Stibnite Gold Project meets the mark.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Vanderbilt Faculty Senate, an elected body composed of deans and representative faculty members, has formally opposed entering into a compact with the Trump administration to comply with new directives in exchange for preferential access to funding.
In an emergency meeting Wednesday, the senate passed a resolution that condemned the proposed compact as a likely violation of state and federal law, and an infringement on the constitutional rights of university members.
“The Faculty Senate of Vanderbilt University firmly opposes this Compact as written and calls upon Chancellor (Daniel) Diermeier and the Board of Trust to also reject this Compact outright as well as any similar proposal compromising the mission, values and independence of the University,” the resolution said. 
The resolution was enacted with a 30-11 vote with one member abstaining.
Vanderbilt campus groups push back against Trump administration higher ed ‘compact’

The demand that Vanderbilt and eight other elite universities sign onto the so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” whose details were first reported in the Wall Street Journal, has drawn criticism from campus groups and free speech advocates. 
The 10-page proposed contract would require the schools to adhere to a number of ideological goals set by the Trump administration. Among them is that campus faculty and employees abstain from actions and speech about off-campus political events, capping foreign student enrollment and a commitment to use “lawful force if necessary,” to combat protests that impede access to campus facilities.
The directives, the resolution said, “”contains provisions antithetical to the missions and traditions of the university” and “endanger(s) the independence and integrity of the university.”
A Vanderbilt spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the university’s X account that said, “we look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.”
In addition to Vanderbilt, letters proposing the compact were sent to Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.

But as a small business owner who relies on data-powered advertising, analytics, and personalized outreach to customers, I was alarmed to see Maine lawmakers downplay the risks of adopting rigid “data minimization” rules like those in the Maryland Online Privacy Rights Act. Maryland’s law is an outlier, going further than even California or Europe in restricting how data can be collected and used. If Maine were to enact similar provisions, it would seriously hurt small businesses like mine.
Fourteen years ago, my wife and I started making soy-wax candles in a boathouse on our Edgecomb property. Today, we sell our candles in L.L. Bean, Whole Foods, and specialty retailers nationwide, as well as from our own studio in Edgecomb, Boothbay Harbor store, and online shop. 
Data plays a critical role in our business’s growth. Aggregated data — showing things like which products most interest our customers and the regions where our products are popular — helps us understand our customer base and improve our marketing. And past-purchase data allows us to tell existing customers about new products or special deals, helping build customer loyalty. 
In addition, our digital advertising partners use non-personally identifiable data to show our ads to people most likely to be interested in our products — for example, people who’ve been searching online for candles or gift shops in our area. That means we don’t waste money advertising to people who aren’t interested in scented candles. And data analytics from our partners show which ads are most effective, allowing us to pull or tweak poor performers. In short, data helps us make the most of our small marketing and advertising budget — enabling us to connect with customers, generate sales, compete with much bigger manufacturers, and grow our business.
“Data minimization” rules would prevent Maine small businesses like ours from fully leveraging data for these critical purposes, because they’d limit us to using customers’ data only to provide products or services customers specifically requested. If we can’t use data to inform and power our marketing and advertising, we’ll struggle to understand and reach customers — and make sales. And because the data in question is non-personally identifiable, the benefit to consumers’ privacy would be minimal.
Protecting consumers’ privacy is important. But overregulating data would make it harder for Maine small businesses to survive and grow — at a time when we’re already struggling with economic uncertainty, inflation, and tariffs. I know that lawmakers are well-intentioned, but they also need to be realistic about how data regulations will affect small businesses. Mainers will be best served by balanced legislation that safeguards consumers’ data while allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed.

[…]","Were these protesters in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 16, 2025, inspired by Thomas Paine? (Alex Brandon/AP)In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?”
For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it.
“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.
The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders, laughing louder than anybody.
That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself.
If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact.
Saying “no” — especially to those in power — is an underrated American pastime, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.”
I could go on. Because he did.
 
Birth of a revolutionary
Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London, sailed to America, and there found his true métier as a pamphleteer and radical.
Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism, the supernatural: no, no, no.
But what Paine made his name lambasting — what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force — were kings. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime.
“Common Sense,” his first major work, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.
 
‘Simple facts, plain arguments’
Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings?
The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.
This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s difficult to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it.
Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.”
Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch.
“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.
 
Bring the Paine
The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.
This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal.
But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.
“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.”
Federal worker firings, court settlements, a government shutdown. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.
Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown.
This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke.
The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.
Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)If there were a trophy for squandering opportunity, Nebraska would already have it on the shelf.
On Sept. 3, the Nebraska Broadband Office, or NBO, released its draft final proposal for how to spend $405 million in federal broadband funds. Advocates for rural broadband like myself fought hard for that money, challenging providers’ overstated coverage and identifying tens of thousands of missing locations.
The federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, or BEAD, promised to fix rural broadband in Nebraska once and for all. Instead, NBO fumbled. Out of $405 million, the plan spends barely $43 million and connects fewer than 1,300 locations to fiber broadband. More than $350 million is left untouched, likely to go back to D.C. without benefiting our state. That’s not planning. It is malpractice.
Fiber is permanent infrastructure. It is reliable, weatherproof and built to last for decades. It is the backbone of education, healthcare, precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, manufacturing and remote work.
NBO’s alternative? Fixed wireless and satellite. Both have their place, and they aren’t inherently bad solutions for rural connectivity. But their performance, reliability and future scalability pale in comparison to fiber. Relegating over 10,000 rural homes and businesses to second-class broadband is a disservice to every Nebraskan — a patch job, not progress. Betting Nebraska’s future on them is like renting a tent in tornado alley and calling it a house.
NBO claims Nebraska’s proposal is “connecting homes, businesses and community anchor institutions.” Optimistic and only half-true. More than 700 schools, libraries, fire departments and health centers were identified as eligible for BEAD’s funding for that purpose. NBO chose to connect only 54.
NBO’s biggest misstep was how it handled location eligibility. Nebraska started with nearly 30,000 eligible locations. Then NBO let unlicensed wireless providers claim coverage without proof. No maps. No evidence. Just “trust us.” Overnight, 7,500 locations were suddenly reclassified as “served.” Add in federal map changes, and Nebraska lost 52% of its list. Most states cut none.
Then there are the satellites. NBO is spending $2.3 million on Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a service with zero customers and a handful of test satellites in orbit. The proposal trusts Jeff Bezos’ hobby project to serve 1,500 Nebraskans. SpaceX’s Starlink, which already covers Nebraska, gets another $2.5 million to serve places it already serves. This is internet meant to power a campsite, not an economy.
Transparency is scarce. Since Sept. 3, NBO has revised its project list three times, each time cutting funding for schools and libraries with neither explanation nor notice. Just moving numbers around and leaving the public and providers in the dark.
Meanwhile, our neighbors are lapping us. Iowa and Kansas, with the same “flat and treeless” terrain Nebraska used as an excuse, each connected about half of their locations to fiber. Wyoming and Montana, with tougher topography, managed two to three times Nebraska’s fiber commitment. North Dakota? 93% fiber. Nebraska? Dead last — an outlier in the worst way.
Yes, the rules changed. Yes, it made the job harder. But the job is not to roll over when Washington makes things difficult. The job is to fight for Nebraskans, not fold. That is surrender, not leadership.
Excuses might make the politics easier, but they do not bring lasting infrastructure to our farms, schools, businesses and families. If other states can push back and still commit to fiber, Nebraska could too.
Our state’s chance at full connectivity is fading before our eyes. Nebraska appears poised to leave more than $350 million on the table and lock rural communities into second-rate service.
Nebraskans didn’t fight for $405 million to watch it evaporate. Fiber is the gold standard, and we deserve leaders with the backbone to deliver it. Anything less is a betrayal of every family, farmer, business and student left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide.

(Sandra Mu/Getty Images)The Nebraska Broadband Office (NBO) is proud to announce the achievement of our most significant milestone – the allocation of more than $42 million in Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program awards to connect the final 14,032 unserved and underserved Nebraska locations to high-speed, reliable broadband.
These awards, pending final approval by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), represent the biggest step yet toward total connectivity in our state.
This achievement is the result of years of steady effort, persistence and adaptation to changing federal guidance. NBO has worked tirelessly to meet every requirement of the BEAD program while keeping our focus on the needs of Nebraskans.
Creation of the NBO was one of Gov. Jim Pillen’s first initiatives. Our work now is to carry out his vision to meet Nebraska’s broadband needs — especially in rural communities — by ensuring access that is affordable, reliable and high-speed.
The final 14,000 locations are the most challenging to connect. These are the places that providers have historically been reluctant to serve, as evidenced by the lack of applications to serve them received by our office.
For the first time, every one of these locations now has a firm commitment to receive the same quality of broadband service available in our most connected communities. This is an extraordinary accomplishment that reflects a commitment to broadband for all.
Nebraska’s plan embraces every solution, creating a deployment strategy that is practical and forward-looking. These technologies not only exceed NTIA’s current requirements but are evolving rapidly, operating at the cutting edge and advancing before our eyes. Most importantly, this approach gets service to families and businesses faster.
Our plan also extends impact beyond homes and businesses by connecting 54 community anchor institutions, such as libraries, hospitals and fire stations that serve as vital hubs for communities. This new infrastructure will strengthen Nebraska’s capacity for healthcare, education and emergency response while laying infrastructure that nearby communities can build upon.
Our work will not stop here. As of this proposal, approximately $324.6 million of Nebraska’s BEAD allocation remains unspent. NBO is aggressively working to keep these funds in the state. This would allow us to pursue non-deployment investments that will multiply the impact of these funds – enhancing precision agriculture, expanding access to healthcare technologies, supporting digital workforce readiness and preparing communities for an AI-driven economy.
These efforts, combined with our deployment plan, will broaden opportunities for every Nebraskan, ensuring that both our people and our communities thrive in a rapidly evolving world.
This plan reflects the very best of Nebraska: persistence, adaptability and innovation. By combining the strengths of multiple technologies and preparing for what comes next, we are setting the stage for a broadband network that will serve Nebraskans today and keep our state at the forefront of connectivity tomorrow.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Maryland police leaders face an unprecedented crisis in American law enforcement. The Trump administration’s deployment of masked federal agents, militarization of immigration enforcement and attempted use of National Guard troops for civilian policing represents a fundamental threat to constitutional governance and professional law enforcement.
The current federal approach bears little resemblance to traditional law enforcement. More than 75% of people booked into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, with less than 10% convicted of serious crimes like murder, assault, robbery or rape.
This isn’t targeted enforcement of dangerous criminals; it’s indiscriminate sweeps of immigrant communities.
Federal agents hide their faces during arrests. U.S. citizens have been detained by masked agents in plain clothes. These are methods of authoritarian regimes, not constitutional democracies.
Federal law enforcement resources are being diverted wholesale from their core missions. FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, ATF agents, DEA agents and Homeland Security personnel who should be investigating terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes and white-collar crimes are instead conducting immigration sweeps.
Against this backdrop, Maryland’s expansion of 287(g) participation from three to eight sheriff’s offices in 2025 entangles local police in a fundamentally compromised federal operation. When Maryland agencies sign 287(g) agreements, they become part of a system that operates without accountability, violates constitutional norms and destroys community trust.

Research shows 287(g) programs significantly reduce violent crime reporting among victims. In Maryland’s diverse communities, home to significant immigrant populations in Baltimore, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, Frederick County and elsewhere, domestic violence victims won’t call police, witnesses won’t cooperate with homicide investigations and human-trafficking victims will remain hidden – subjected to greater risk.
The current federal immigration enforcement crisis makes community policing principles more essential than ever. Decades of research demonstrate that effective policing requires community cooperation, trust and legitimacy. When communities view police as partners in public safety, crime reporting increases, witness cooperation improves and crime prevention becomes possible.
Many Maryland agencies have invested in community policing models, building relationships with neighborhood groups and earning legitimacy through fair treatment of all residents. These relationships take years to build but can be destroyed overnight.
The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics are already creating fear in immigrant communities across Maryland. Children are afraid to go to school. Workers won’t report wage theft or workplace safety violations. Domestic violence victims are staying in dangerous situations.
For Maryland police leaders, this environment demands a choice: Double down on community policing efforts or sacrifice community trust and collaborative problem solving for politicized federal immigration priorities. There is no middle ground.
Professional law enforcement organizations, the Police Executive Research Forum, Major Cities Chiefs Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police, all warn that immigration enforcement by local police fundamentally undermines community trust and public safety.
Maryland chiefs and sheriffs have professional and constitutional obligations that transcend federal pressure. They must maintain operational independence, protect constitutional policing, preserve community relationships, consider exiting 287(g) where applicable, resist militarization and document federal overreach.
Maryland has worked for decades to professionalize law enforcement, implement community policing and build trust with diverse populations. Community policing isn’t just a buzzword – it’s an operational necessity that enables police to solve crimes, prevent violence and maintain public safety.
This moment demands that Maryland police leaders remember why community policing principles emerged in the first place: because enforcement-only models don’t work. Aggressive, militarized policing that treats communities as occupied territory creates the conditions for crime to flourish by destroying the community cooperation that effective policing requires.
The question facing Maryland police leaders isn’t whether immigration law should be enforced, that’s a federal policy matter. The question is whether local police will maintain their professional integrity and constitutional obligations in the face of federal overreach.
The evidence is clear: 287(g) participation exacerbates every problem created by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Maryland police leaders who prioritize public safety, constitutional governance and professional policing must reject this false choice between federal cooperation and their core mission. Their loyalty is to the Constitution, to professional standards and to the communities they serve, not to a federal administration that has abandoned all three.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54348554551_ce02f39035_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) canceled an environmental review of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project – a sprawling development of seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects that would cover more than 62,000 acres  nearly 100 square miles — of public land about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.
The joint project was proposed by six solar energy companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy.
All together, the network of solar panels and batteries in Esmeralda County was expected to produce as much as 6.2 gigawatts of energy under ideal conditions, or enough electricity to power nearly two million homes.

After months of delays, the Department of the Interior this week said it was canceling its broad environmental review of the joint project and would instead review the seven projects that make up the development separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”
The Department of the Interior said the impacted energy companies will now have the option to submit a separate application for their individual project proposals. 
“The BLM did not cancel the project. During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” said an Interior spokesperson in an email Friday.
“Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” the email continued. 
It’s unclear how many of the impacted solar companies will continue to pursue their individual projects after the change in how the proposals will be reviewed.
A spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said the company was committed to their individual project – the Esmeralda Energy Center – which is a part of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project. 
“NextEra Energy Resources is one of six companies pursuing projects in Esmeralda County, Nevada. We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management,” a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said in an email Friday. 
A spokesperson for Leeward Energy, one of the companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said “we don’t have any information to share regarding the project update.”
Representatives for the other four energy companies involved in developing the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project did not respond to requests for comment.
Kevin Emmerick, the co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, said he’s skeptical solar companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project would be eager to resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration.”
In July the Trump administration mandated that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, a threshold that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said has already stalled several solar projects in the state. 
Emmerick, who opposed the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said he isn’t surprised the project’s broad environmental review was canceled given the new rules under the Trump administration, and suspects singular approval of each project will be even more cumbersome.
“Solar and wind energy have several new layers of approval for each individual project so this programmatic review for all seven projects makes that kind of individual scrutiny very difficult,” Emmerick said. 
Federal land managers began reviewing the developers’ joint proposals in 2023 under former president Joe Biden. But the project’s environmental review process has been stalled since Donald Trump took office. 
Federal land managers were expected to issue a final environmental impact statement for the project — the last step before a record of decision is issued — at the end of April, but neither materialized. 
The project has attracted strong opposition from locals and conservation groups who caution the size of the project could negatively impact the environment and rural communities’ way of life. 
Several conservation groups have asked federal land managers to move the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project to areas the BLM has earmarked as “solar energy zones” — areas it sees as prime for solar development. Esmeralda County has two solar energy zones, encompassing about 21,000 acres of land. 
Shaaron Netherton, the executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said she hopes the cancellation of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”
“We need to focus on disturbed  areas and utilize warehouse and data center roofs for solar before using vast stretches of our public lands,” said Netherton, who opposed the joint project. 
“Storey County is being completely developed for industrial buildings. This would be a great place to cover with solar. Producing energy right where it is needed,” she said. 
Locals have also expressed frustration with solar companies’ lack of communication when proposing projects. Esmeralda County commissioner Fred Perez said more than a dozen solar companies have proposed projects in his county. Perez said none of those companies have been in communication with him, including the companies that comprise the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the BLM needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”
“We remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Norris said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sevensolarblmcover-1024x698.jpeg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

He identifies with the Black Robe Regiment, a coalition of pastors committed to tearing down the wall of separation between church and state.
Still, the Rev. Jack Martin insists politics won’t interfere with his volunteer school service.
Living in Hernando County since 1997, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2016 and in 2022. In the 2022 Republican primary, Martin came in second to U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, earning 9.2% of the vote.
Martin remains politically active, particularly through his Facebook and Rumble accounts, posting an array of social media videos supporting Republicans and criticizing Democrats. Among his posts:

An ode to Charlie Kirk.
A video criticizing U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the government shutdown, calling him “Uncle Chuckles.”
An image boosting “Pastors for Trump.”
A photo calling for former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be deputized so he can arrest former President Barack Obama.
A video advocating for ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which Martin says saved his life after catching COVID.

“If we want our country back, we can’t stand as spectators applauding Donald Trump.  We need to take our armor, get out there in the battle alongside of Donald Trump,” Martin said during an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly.
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin told the Phoenix that “without apology there are things he [Trump] does I don’t like, too,” and that his support for Trump is “in areas that are restoring our country to be a more sound republic.”
Still, Martin insists his motivation to serve as a chaplain is “not anything political, it’s not to proselytize, it’s to help kids.”
Registered as clergy under the Christian Life Assembly of God church, the Rev. Martin is listed as a chaplain on the Hernando County Schools’ website, meaning he is qualified to “provide support, services, and programs” to students who seek it out.
A 2024 law, HB 931, that permits volunteer chaplains drew backlash from some faith leaders for the possibility it would lead to religious proselytization of students, “undermine the secular nature of public education,” and violate the Establishment Clause, the part of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits government establishment or preference of a religion, the Phoenix has reported.
Faith leaders warn schools of dangers of optional, voluntary chaplain program

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is asking the district to backtrack and not only take away Martin’s permission to serve as a chaplain but to eliminate the entire program, which is voluntary for students.
“Rev. Martin has openly promoted Christian nationalism and disparaged public education itself. His stated views are incompatible with the religious neutrality required of public schools and threaten to undermine the trust and inclusivity essential to serving Hernando County’s diverse student body,” the foundation wrote in its letter to Hernando officials.
The foundation advocated for access for students to “trained professionals such as school counselors, psychologists, and social workers — not clergy advancing religious or political agendas.”
“Please understand that permitting a religious chaplaincy in a public school district jeopardizes the rights of students and parents and invites legal challenge,” the organization’s legal counsel, Christopher Line, concluded in his letter.
Constitutional concerns
The retired Pentecostal pastor told the Phoenix in a phone interview this week he does not share constitutional concerns about the program. He’s “100% sure before the Supreme Court that it would be proven pure and good.”
As chaplain, Martin said, he will try to be “one more layer in a system that’s trying to help our kids get through school and graduate as healthy as they can.”
A father of six homeschooled children, Martin served as chaplain for Spring Hill Fire and Hernando County Fire for 17 years. That experience, he said, has prepared him to work with students.
If a tragedy such as a school shooting were to happen, “I would be the most trained — even out of their counselors — I would be the most trained to be able to go in and immediately start to help,” Martin told the Phoenix.

Citing his outspokenness about Jan. 6, 2021, and his commitment to the Black Robe Regiment, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has called Martin a Christian nationalist.
His response: “I am a Christian who loves the United States of America, the nation that God has allowed me to be born and live in. And I respect the laws of the land. And I respect the word of God. And I attempt, the best I can, to live in a manner that would be the life the way Jesus would have done it.”
Martin does identify as a Black Robe Regiment pastor. The national organization with that name bills itself as a “modern-day network of patriotic pastors and religious leaders striving to safeguard liberty by helping clergy and community leaders step into their God-given duty of leading from the pulpit, in the community, and in government.”
A 2022 Vice report cited by the Freedom From Religion Foundation asserts the Black Robe Regiment does fall within the rubric of Christian nationalism, having ties to Gen. Flynn, who in his Reawakening America tours has argued “the church should be at the heart of all aspects of American society.”
Martin says the Vice story is inaccurate. “I mean the Black Robe Regiment is a term, it’s not one group of people,” he said.
Last month, Martin posted on the Black Robe Regiment Facebook group, of which he’s an administrator, “I say this in humility but mark down that the first Public School Chaplain in the State of Florida is a Black Robe Regiment pastor.”
Martin insists the topics he’s been outspoken about would not be part of his offerings as a chaplain.
“In the past, at school board meetings, I’ve spoken on vaccines, on mandatory masking, and things like that. But those were as a citizen and those were prior to any chaplaincy program existing. But they would not be something that would be talked about,” Martin said.

In an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly in August, Martin said he could help combat bullying in schools and calm kids after any bomb or gun scares.
Martin said he was invited to speak to the organization, which declares “everything else will fall into proper place by reforming the Republican Party with Judeo-Christian conservative constitutionalists with the Courage to do what’s right.”
“I hear a lot of pastors say, ‘We’ve fixed the problem, we’ve got Christian schools.’ My only problem with that is, what about all the kids that are still in public school and who are still being forced to believe stuff they shouldn’t?” Martin told the Assembly.
The Rev. Martin has amplified right-wing talking points blaming transgender people for political violence. The day after a shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minnesota, Martin told the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly that, “if long before that, somebody had sat down and helped those young people, they would have got the help they need.”
In addressing gender-confirming care, Martin told the Phoenix, “My personal view — and, again, I could not use this one in the school, obviously — but my personal view is that you’re hurting kids. It would be like telling the anorexic if you eat more it will get better, you’re just hurting them. And I think my whole heart in trying to be a chaplain is to help kids, not to hurt them and not to create a bigger problem than already exists.”
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin has a Rumble channel called “THE HARD RIGHT SAVING AMERICA” and publishes songs he’s written. One title is “The Ballad of J6ers,” a “tribute” to participants in the events that transpired in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, which he called “no insurrection. It was a 1A protest by citizens.”
“I am a man who loves my country, I was in D.C. that day along with my good buddies believing free speech worked that way,” Martin wrote in his  lyrics, although he stresses he wasn’t there.
There’s an accompanying video featuring clips of  the insurrection and an artificial intelligence-generated image of Obama being handcuffed by FBI agents in the Oval Office as Trump watches.
“And maybe justice will be served and the bad folks are put in jail,” the song continues.
Martin told the Phoenix the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s criticism is incorrect.
“They referred to a song that I had written and I used the quote the president [Trump] used. I want them to go be peaceful protests, and they tried to make it as if I said that was a peaceful protest. I have my own view on that day,” Martin said — going on to allege that more than 270 Deep State “insiders” were among protesters. “I have questions that there was at least some shenanigans with that day.”
Xs and Os
The Hernando County School Board approved language implementing the state’s first public school chaplain the program earlier this year, making it the first district to welcome the volunteer religious figures.
“Pastor Jack, I want to say that I appreciate everything that you have done in leading this chaplain program. I have worked with you hand-in-hand, day-after-day, week-after-week, we’ve had a few months at this, and it’s been some long, hard discussions,” Hernando School Board Chair Shannon Rodriguez said during a school board meeting last month. “I’m honored to come alongside of you.”
The district’s policies outline that chaplains:

May provide religious or spiritual guidance to students, lead students in prayer, and offer reflective, non-judgmental listening to students who are going through a difficult time.
May not seek to persuade or force any student to participate.
May not proselytize for or disparage any religion, belief, lack of belief, or faith group
Provision of care, help or counsel is not proselytization or disparagement.

The district, which operates more than 20 schools, requires chaplains to obtain “an ecclesiastical endorsement from their faith group” to certify they are indeed a leader in the faith, “qualified spiritually, morally, intellectually, and emotionally to serve as a chaplain for the board,” and “sensitive to religious pluralism and able to provide for the free exercise of religion by all students.” 
The policy prescribes that “the selection of a chaplain should reflect the expectations of the local community.”
The program has officially started, although Martin said his counsel has not yet been called upon. 
The policies require interested parents to opt in and provide Martin protections from lawsuits. 
The law requires interested school chaplains to first pass a Level 2 background check, “a state and national fingerprint-based check and consideration of disqualifying offenses and applies to those employees designated by law as holding positions of responsibility or trust.”
After passing the background check, a chaplain wishing to provide services must schedule a consultation with a school principal and interested parents to earn signatures from both parties.
“I would like to look at this three years down the road and see the value of what’s come out of the program, and be able to look back and say, ‘See, this is why I thought it was effective,'” Martin said. 
After the Phoenix’s interview with Martin, a second chaplain was added to the district website, Shawn May, registered with Great Life Church, a non-denominational church in Spring Hill.
State definition of ‘religion’ too narrow, Satanic Temple says

Although groups have raised criticisms and threatened legal action, Martin said he hopes Hernando’s program “can prove to be effective to the good of the school and the students in a way that, if other counties wanted to try it, they would model a program. 
“The school board has done an incredible job of implementing a program that limits what I can do and that’s fine with me,” he added. 
Last year, pastors opposed to chaplains entering schools told the Phoenix they disagreed with its “scout’s honor” system to not proselytize.
Following the passage of the chaplain law, the Satanic Temple told the Florida Gannett newspapers that it intends to take advantage of the law, the Phoenix reported last year. They since have complained that the state’s model policy for districts to carry out the law was too narrow.

A majority of the Douglas County Board, which oversees the county jail as the Board of Corrections, issued a statement Friday objecting to the idea announced Thursday by Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

The statement by Commissioners Chris Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, Brian Fahey and Board Chair Roger Garcia offered several reasons for the rationale of the majority on the seven-member elected board.
Garcia previously rebuffed the idea of contracting jail space to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. If put to a vote, that majority would douse the possibility of such a county contract. 
“We will not support any expansion of immigration detention at the Douglas County Jail,” the commissioners’ said in a statement urging instead the state’s federal delegation to work toward comprehensive immigration reform. 
 Financial benefit?

The four said their preferred approach “requires coalition-building and advocacy at the federal level, not contracts that perpetuate harm.” They said that “true humanitarian choice is not to detain mothers, fathers and workers” whom they described as “essential” to the local economy.

While the commissioners said they “fully support” holding violent and drug-trafficking criminals accountable,” they said 72% of ICE detainees nationally have no criminal history. “Detaining hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here does not make us safer; it only deepens fear, trauma and economic loss across our communities.”
They also questioned any financial benefit, saying the cost to house an inmate at the county jail is $220 per day, an amount they said exceeds the $175 per diem contract ICE currently pays nearby counties.
Hanson, in response, told the Nebraska Examiner that the county is in an “enviable position” to negotiate a better deal. He said the new revenue stream could be reinvested back into his department’s own trimmed budget, offer tax relief and enhanced public safety measures for county residents and potentially create a national model that could direct money to local immigrant communities.
He’s urged the County Board to put the idea to a public vote.
“This should be on an agenda in which people can come and voice their opinion pro or con, and ultimately elected leaders can do what we are supposed to do, make tough choices,” Hanson said.
A county agreement with ICE for detention, the sheriff said, would allow individuals arrested in the Omaha area to stay close to their families and the area’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.” 
He cited the June 10 Omaha Glenn Valley Foods raid in which most of the nearly 80 undocumented workers detained were transported roughly four hours away to a North Platte jail in Lincoln County, which has a contract with ICE.
In an Oct. 7 memo to County Board members, Hanson said the county jail had space and was operating at a “historic low capacity.”
 ‘Deeply troubling’

But according to the director of Douglas County Corrections, Michael Myers, the county jail population has steadily increased since late last year. The total incarcerated population as of today is 1,101, up from 914 in December, Myers said in a statement from a county spokesperson.
Douglas County sheriff urges ICE detention contract for jail, County Board chair balks

Projections, Myers said, show the county on pace to process roughly 1,500 more inmates this year compared to last year, when it booked 15,500 individuals.
Two legal centers that advocated for workers detained in the Omaha Glenn Valley immigration raid weighed in Friday on the ICE-Douglas County proposal, one calling it “deeply troubling.” 
“Immigration detention should never be a business model,” said Roxana Cortes-Mills, legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement. “The Douglas County sheriff’s proposal to profit from detaining immigrants is deeply troubling, especially at a time when fear and uncertainty are already at an all-time high.”
Said Cortes-Mills, “Let’s be honest, this isn’t about access to health care or staying close to family and legal support. It’s about expanding detention in Nebraska and profiting from an administration intent on dehumanizing immigrants.”
She said CIRA attorneys would continue serving communities across the state “to uphold due process and dignity for all.”
 Promote dialogue

American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which also represents several Glenn Valley detainees, objected to what it called the “illusion” that closer ICE detention facilities would benefit immigrant families.

ACLU executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said that “trying to sprinkle in incentives of money and geographic closeness” is an effort to “hide the ball, so to speak, about what this would actually mean for our communities.”
She said if one asked ACLU’s Omaha clients, they’d likely say it would have been “easier” to have loved one detained closer than North Platte. She, however, doubts those families would support increased ICE detention space in their community.
ACLU believes heavier ICE presence and jail capacity would lead to increased likelihood of “unlawful detentions and liability to the county itself.”
“We all need to push back against the concept this is happening anyway, so we might as well get paid for it,” Rush Chipman said. “This is not good for our communities, no matter if you try to describe and disguise it.”
Hanson sees his proposal as humane for families and a “lucrative opportunity” for the county.
“The biggest thing I’m trying to promote here is dialogue,” he said. “Can we find a way to mitigate the thing that we cannot control — federal detention?”

The State Board of Education was set to vote this week on a controversial measure that many school officials and education advocates say would bar local municipalities from providing much-needed funding and support services to local schools. 
Instead the board voted unanimously on Thursday, at a DEED official’s request, to take no action and return the proposal to the department for further development.

“As a result of the feedback we received, the department will be recommending that the state board take no action on this item, return the proposed regulation to the board or to the department for further collaboration and input with key stakeholders,” said Heather Heineken, the division director for finance and support services for the department, to the board Wednesday, the first day of a two-day meeting. 
The proposal came under sharp criticism and public alarm beginning in June, when DEED introduced the measure as an emergency regulation change. Officials said the move was intended to redefine the amount local municipalities provide for schools — called the local contribution — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
At the time, DEED officials said it was a way to address the balance of funding for schools ↣— in Alaska’s complex school funding formula which includes local, state and federal funding — and avoid failing a federal disparity test. 
The disparity test is required by the U.S. Department of Education to regulate the spread between the highest and lowest funded districts, because of the way the state uses some federal funding, called impact aid. The state failed the test earlier this year, but is in the process of appealing the ruling. 
Education Commissioner Deena Bishop, however, reversed that argument and told board members further discussion was needed with districts and financial offices to clarify what “in-kind” contributions are being made and how they were accounted for. She said that was needed to align with state law and standards for equity between districts. 
“We’re not reacting to the federal government. What we are (doing) is trying to meet the state statute that calls for that equitable funding,” Bishop told the board on Wednesday.
Public raises alarm at unclear change to local contributions
State board members received more than 600 public comments, mostly opposing the measure, in June and July when the regulation was introduced, calling the proposed change vague and potentially limiting vital municipal funding for schools. 
During public comment on Thursday, several district officials expressed opposition and concern.
Valdez School District Superintendent Jason Weber said the change could jeopardize essential city funding, including for transportation and school meals. 
“Our Food Service Program is also at a breaking point. Even after raising lunch prices by $1 per meal last year, we’re still operating at a deficit. Every dollar cut from food service funding is $1 taken away from the plates of kids, these regulations would directly reduce the food we can provide for our students, something no community should have to accept,” he said. 
“Each Alaskan community has unique needs and challenges the decisions about how to support and operate schools should be made by those who live and work closest to them, not through a one size fits all mandate from the state level, undermining local authority threatens the very foundation of community supported education in Alaska,” Weber said.
Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser pointed to the state’s own appeal of the federal disparity test as evidence the change is unnecessary. 
“According to DEED’s July 14 letter, the state would meet the disparity standard, not with a regulation change, which isn’t even mentioned, but by a different accounting method,” Hauser said.
Hauser asked board members to vote the regulation down. 
“I am terrified of version 3.0 of this regulation. Each subsequent attempt at this regulation change has had exponentially more negative impacts, impacts beyond what the department realizes, even to REAAS, home school and correspondence students, instead of enacting the oft quoted definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, I ask you today to take a different direction and ask the department to stop with this effort altogether,” he said.
During public comment, district officials also raised concerns at a recent DEED Facebook post, which shared a statement over an image of a burning dumpster fire, calling several Anchorage officials’ out by name, saying that their information was “inaccurate” and saying DEED no longer was pushing the proposal. Commenters called the social media post “unprofessional” and not “positive or proactive communication.”
Anchorage officials had penned an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, opposing the regulation change, saying it could “gut” the district and strip $15 million in municipal funding, including for school buses and school resource officers. 
State board members vote to return proposal to DEED
Before the vote, several state board members questioned whether the proposal should come back to the board.
“I guess I’m questioning now, is it really an issue, or is that needs to be addressed, or does it just need to go away?” asked board member Pamela Dupras on Thursday. 
Bishop responded that DEED will gather more feedback, and work with districts to adhere to state law and requirements for equitability. She also pointed to the new Legislative Task Force on Education Funding that may take up the issue and recommend new legislation to define local contributions.
Bishop said DEED would work with district officials and finance departments to further clarify the requirements. “I’m glad that you’re pulling this back,” she said. 
She also acknowledged the frustration of districts. “Every two weeks from August until now, I’ve been sharing the same message that, yes, we do not want to put this forward. So I understand the frustration with what was in writing, certainly superintendents that attended all those meetings knew the intent,” she said. 
“I think just the stress about school funding, a lot of trust isn’t there,” Bishop added. “The Department wants to earn that trust back and continue with the work.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

Mike Dunleavy’s re-election campaign in 2022 must comply with a subpoena issued as part of a yearslong investigation, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In a 13-page decision, the court rejected a series of arguments offered by attorneys representing the Republican Governors Association, and it ordered the organization to comply with the subpoena.
The decision was authored by Justice Dario Borghesan, a Dunleavy appointee.
Attorneys representing the RGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Since 2022, the Alaska Public Offices Commission has been seeking documents from the RGA — a national group that backs Republican candidates for governor — to determine whether or not the group illegally colluded with Dunleavy’s 2022 campaign.
The RGA is considered an “independent expenditure” group and thus is barred by law from coordinating with a political candidate’s campaign. In 2022, two progressive groups filed complaints against the RGA. 
The state watchdog agency APOC, which regulates political campaign spending, began an investigation, but the RGA refused to comply with a subpoena seeking banking information and relevant communications.
Anchorage-based attorney Scott Kendall, who represents the political groups that filed complaints against the RGA three years ago, said that if RGA now complies with the subpoenas, APOC can actually judge the original complaints on their merits.
That could have implications for next year’s governor election, Kendall said on Friday.
“Are they going to participate (in the 2026 election)? If they’re going to participate, are they going to disclose their donors if they participate?” he asked. “What will the public think of them if, in fact, APOC does find that they broke the law? I have to believe the RGA has the intention of trying to participate in this upcoming election, and whether they broke the law last time, and whether they intend to follow the law this time, I think, are very, very relevant issues.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1280273369-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

Shortly before leaving office in July to run for governor as a Republican candidate, former commissioner Adam Crum approved a $50 million private equity investment with the firm DigitalBridge, using money from the state’s principal savings account.
That account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, has about $2.9 billion and until now has been invested in ways that can be easily convertible to cash in case the state needs to spend it on short notice. 
Private equity investments, which typically involve taking a share of a company that isn’t yet listed on a stock market, frequently take years to mature. This is the first time the CBR has been invested in private equity.
The DigitalBridge investment can’t be canceled, said a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Revenue.
Though the investment involves less than 2% of the budget reserve’s funds, state legislators expect to spend — at the least — hundreds of millions of dollars from the reserve next year in order to pay for services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a written statement on Oct. 3 that they “were caught off guard” when they learned about the move.
They said putting “tens of millions of dollars into an illiquid, high-risk investment” undermines the purpose of the budget reserve, which is to provide stability. 
“Future high risk investments of this nature should not occur without the involvement of the Legislature,” they said. 
Crum’s successor as revenue commissioner, Janelle Earls, was also concerned about the process used for making the investment, said Aimee Bushnell, a spokesperson for the Department of Revenue. 
“After being advised of the acting commissioner’s concerns, the governor apprised legislative leadership of the transaction, forwarded documents to the legislative auditor for review, and directed an outside third-party review be conducted to determine whether there were in fact any violations of policy and make process recommendations as appropriate,” she said.
Crum, speaking by phone on Thursday, said he was surprised by the reaction, in part because he had been working on the investment for more than a year.
In 2000, lawmakers and then-Gov. Tony Knowles created a subaccount within the budget reserve to allow higher-risk, higher-yield investments. That subaccount was drained in 2015, at a time of plunging oil revenue.
The budget reserve’s money moved to low-risk investments, but that comes at a downside; those investments barely keep up with inflation.
“It actually means you’re deteriorating the buying power of the CBR over time,” he said. “And so that actually is a harmful thing.”
Crum said he asked the Department of Law and then-Attorney General Treg Taylor whether he could pursue alternative investments via the disused subaccount.
The answer was yes, and Crum signed a revision to the CBR subaccount investment policy on July 29. He left office on Aug. 8, and the DigitalBridge investment closed three days later.
The money isn’t going to in-state projects, and Crum said he has no personal ties to DigitalBridge.
“In fact, both myself and DigitalBridge would be in incredible trouble if there were any financial ties,” he said.
Crum said that as revenue commissioner, he had a fiduciary duty to make sure the state’s investments were working as best as they could.
“If we can actually make greater returns, we actually can just make sure that we’re building up the fund over time,” Crum said.
Senate President Stevens, by phone on Thursday, said he understands that the investment is a small part of the CBR, but “we’re concerned that we don’t know what’s going to happen in the economy. We don’t know if oil is going to go to zero. It has in the past, and we’re concerned about having the money we need to run government.”
In May, members of the Senate said at a news conference they were worried about a gap between revenue and expenses in 2026 and said that gap could be as large as $600 million.
An unexpected drop in oil prices or production could widen that gap.
Crum said he believes that if the Legislature needs the last $50 million in the CBR, the state will have much bigger issues by that point.
“The $50 million is such a low dollar amount that I do find it amusing that legislators are clutching their pearls about it, because if we somehow burned through $3 billion in savings and we’re down to our last $50 million, we’re dead in the water,” he said. “That is the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. That is not the $50 million that is going to save the state.”
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and operating budget chair for the House Finance Committee this past year, said he doesn’t think the Legislature will need all of the CBR, but added, “I think there’s a greater concern about the fact that we need readily available cash, and that’s what the CBR was designed to provide. And you know, these high-risk investments may not be conducive with that goal.”
He noted that lawmakers have repeatedly clashed with the executive branch in recent years, including on the topic of financial disclosure. In August, legislators overrode Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill intended to compel the Department of Revenue to release information related to oil tax audits. The department had declined for years to release that information to legislators.
“It’s just — we’re suspicious,” Josephson said. “We don’t know when we can have our $50 million back.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/230120-Crum-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)Alaska judges will not hear a lawsuit alleging that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mishandled the state’s valuable salmon returns.
On Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision that dismissed a case brought by Juneau resident Eric Forrer in 2022.
Forrer had argued that years of declining salmon returns in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers clearly showed that the department was violating a section of the Alaska Constitution that requires fish be managed for sustained yield. 
Forrer, a long-time Alaska resident, has a history of personal-use and commercial fishing, including on the Yukon River. 
In his suit, he sought a declaration confirming that the Fish and Game was violating the constitution and sought an injunction directing the department “to fulfill the sustained yield mandate.”
Bethel Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Peters dismissed the case in 2023, but Forrer appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.
In an 18-page order published Friday, the five-member court said unanimously that because Forrer didn’t challenge a specific policy, law or regulation, Peters was correct and the case should be dismissed.
If the court had allowed the suit, wrote Justice Dario Borghesan, it would have amounted to “judicial management of the fisheries at issue” and “would be contrary to constitutional design and practically untenable.”
Borghesan wrote that if the court were to eventually issue an injunction, Fish and Game would almost be required to guess what solution would be acceptable to the court.
Forrer was represented by attorney Joe Geldhof, who frequently participates in public-interest lawsuits in front of the Alaska Supreme Court.
By phone, Geldhof said he was disappointed by the decision and begs the question of what Alaskans are supposed to do when a state agency isn’t fulfilling its mandate.
“Where do you go when there’s a systemic failure?” he asked.
Friday’s Supreme Court order implies that if that’s the case, elected officials need to fix the issue.
The Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers have seen severe declines in salmon returns despite restrictions on fishing that are intended to increase the number of fish that return to local rivers to breed.
“The separation of powers doctrine prohibits Alaska courts from reviewing nonjusticiable political questions,” Borghesan wrote on behalf of the court. “A claim is not justiciable if ‘deciding the claim would require us to answer questions that are better directed to the legislative or executive branches of government.’”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e6332b94-ab76-4b9a-a536-98a0e73dbbfe_1336x1110.png,,,2025-10-10 20:58:19.875421

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)When 11 babies were exposed to measles in Cache County last month, public health workers rushed to get in touch with their families and helped provide emergency medication to keep the infants from getting sick. 
“I was just really proud of the work that the local health department did, and the local health care facilities,” said Amelia Salmanson, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS. “I went to bed knowing that we were going to be providing this support to these vulnerable babies.”
Salmanson’s still not resting easy, though. She and her colleagues are anticipating a rise in cases of the highly contagious disease, in Utah and beyond. They’re especially focused on other infants too young to be vaccinated but who may come in contact with the virus in day cares or other settings. 
“I get very nervous,” Salmanson said. 
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Utah has recorded 55 cases of measles this year, with the majority – 41– in the southwestern corner of the state. 
That outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border is prompting local health officials to recommend early MMR vaccination (protecting against measles, mumps and rubella) for babies living in or traveling to Washington County. 
The standard MMR vaccine schedule starts at 12 months old, Salmanson said, but babies are eligible at six months. 
DHHS isn’t recommending early vaccination for kids in other counties, but said it will do so later on if it determines a county’s transmission levels put babies at risk. 
Any children who do get an early dose will still need the two standard doses later on, at 12 to 15 months and then at 4 to 6 years, according to the health department. 
Outside of the southwest corner of the state, Utah recorded four cases in its northern Bear River district and three in its southeast district, along with seven in Utah County. 
Utah County doesn’t have any current cases, said spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill. Still, measles has continued to show up in its wastewater, appearing in its most recent sample from Sept. 30.

While no infants were diagnosed in the county’s outbreak, its health department is preparing for the possibility they’ll be exposed. 
“That’s something that, yes, we definitely are concerned about, with how young of a population we have,” Tolman-Hill said, noting Utah County is one of the youngest in the nation. “Along with that, we are concerned about all of the pregnant moms we have out there in our community.” 
Salmanson agreed. 
“In terms of severe illness and risk for complications, young babies and pregnant women are definitely at the top,” she said. 
There’s some indication those with immunity to measles can transfer antibodies to their babies before birth, Salmanson added, but women aren’t eligible to get the vaccine while pregnant. She recommends that those seeking more information visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s website.

,California,2025-10-10 23:55:32+00:00,CalMatters,Judge shuts down California tribes’ latest bid to crush their casino rivals,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/digital-democracy/2025/10/california-gambling-casinos-cardrooms/,California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.,"In summary
California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.


Over the years, casino-owning tribes have spent millions in court, in the Legislature and at the ballot box trying unsuccessfully to force their only competitors out of California’s casino business. 
A judge today blocked their latest effort.
Last year, tribes persuaded the California Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to allow them to sue gambling halls called card rooms over the tribes’ claim that they have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling in the state.
Since the tribes are sovereign governments, they had lacked standing to sue the private businesses until Newsom signed Senate Bill 549, which gave the tribes one shot this year to resolve their dispute in Sacramento County Superior Court.
Superior Court Judge Lauri Damrell today dismissed the tribes’ case, saying federal gambling law superseded the measure Newsom signed.  
“The court is mindful that previous efforts to resolve this longstanding dispute – whether through regulatory action, legislation, ballot initiatives, or litigation – have been unavailing,” Damrell wrote in a tentative ruling that she approved during a hearing. The court “recognizes the genuine desire, shared by many stakeholders, including the California Legislature, to reach the merits and achieve a final resolution. The court does not take lightly the importance of the issues at stake and, were it within its authority to provide a definitive resolution, it would endeavor to do so.” 
Still, Damrell wrote she was “bound by the limits of federal law.”
California’s card room industry applauded the ruling. 
“We are encouraged by today’s decision,” California Gaming Association President Kyle Kirkland said in a written statement. “Our member cardrooms will continue to support good jobs, vital public services, and local economies across California while upholding the highest standards of integrity, accountability, and compliance.”
Tribes say they strongly disagree with the court’s decision and plan on appealing it.
“This outcome is especially troubling given that it was a state law enacted just last year that explicitly gave tribes standing in state court,” James Siva, chairperson of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, said in a written statement. “It’s difficult to reconcile this ruling with the clear intent of the Legislature, and once again, a court has sidestepped the actual merits of the case — effectively denying tribes a fair opportunity to seek justice.”
Tribal revenues vs. city taxes
The tribes sued on Jan. 2, the first day the courts were open and the day after SB 549 took effect.
The tribes’ suit alleged that the dozens of gambling halls scattered across California were illegally offering card games such as black jack and pai gow poker that cut into the tribes’ gambling revenues.
“Defendants brazenly profit from illegal gambling,” the tribes said in the opening line of their lawsuit.
Tribes say California voters years ago gave them the exclusive rights to host table games, which they use as a critically important source of revenue to support their historically disenfranchised communities.
Under the bill, tribes cannot receive any money or attorneys’ fees from the lawsuit. Instead, they  could only petition the court to decide whether card rooms can continue to offer the disputed games.
The stakes are high outside of casinos since some cities receive nearly half of their budgets from taxes on card rooms, meaning a tribal victory in court would have jeopardized money for police, firefighters and other local services.
San Jose City Councilmember Sergio Jimenez told lawmakers last year that the city receives $30 million each year from card rooms, enough to fund 150 police officers or 133 firefighters. Jimenez said that money’s in jeopardy if the tribes prevail in court.
The card room industry claims the games are legal and that the attorney general’s office has approved each of them over the years. 
The tribes have tried to sue card rooms for unfair business practices before. But California’s courts have ruled that the tribes don’t have standing.
“There is little doubt that commercial cardrooms are flouting the law by offering illegal games and operating outside the bounds of state regulations,” Siva said in today’s statement. “All we have ever sought is a clear judicial determination on whether these practices are lawful under state law. That is not an unreasonable ask — and tribes should not be denied
their day in court.”
An expensive political fight
The fight over SB 549 was one of the most costly political battles of the two-year legislative session that concluded last year.
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, many of them with large tribal casinos in their districts, pushed for the gambling measure, while a smaller group of lawmakers with card rooms in their districts opposed it.
It followed a failed 2022 sports betting initiative that the tribes spent millions of dollars to sponsor and that included a similar provision that would have let the tribes sue.
The opposing gambling interests donated at least $4.3 million to the 120 members of the Legislature since January 2023, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Facing what they saw as an existential threat, card rooms responded to SB 549’s introduction with a massive lobbying blitz. In 2023, Hawaiian Gardens Casino alone spent $9.1 million on lobbying, the second highest amount reported to state regulators. Only the international oil giant, Chevron Corp., spent more.
Then, despite Newsom signing the law, the card room industry spent more than $3 million in the lead up to the November election in retaliation against four lawmakers who played key roles in the bill’s passage.
Three of the candidates targeted by the card rooms ended up losing, including the bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Josh Newman of Fullerton.
Meanwhile, the tribes’ efforts to push out other gambling competitors from California continued in the Legislature this year. 
The Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831 in September. The measure bans online gaming companies from offering digital sweepstakes that the tribes see as another threat to their exclusive rights to gambling.
Newsom hasn’t yet signed the measure into law. He hasn’t indicated whether he will. He has until Monday to make a decision.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/031423_SoCal-Cardrooms_TS_CM_45.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

(Photo courtesy of Department of Enterprise Services)A Washington man suspected of breaking into and vandalizing the state Capitol is undergoing a mental health evaluation, an attorney confirmed Friday. 
Authorities initially arrested Gunnar McLean Schubert, 29, on suspicion of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. But prosecutors on Wednesday charged him with only second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor.  
To be convicted of both charges, the prosecution would need to prove that Schubert entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime inside, and that he damaged less than $750-worth of property. 
Schubert’s arraignment was scheduled for Friday afternoon, but was delayed a week to allow him to complete his mental health evaluation as previously ordered by the court. His hearing is now scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 17. 
The evaluation will determine whether Schubert is mentally capable of proceeding with his case. If he is found incompetent, he will be admitted to an involuntary treatment facility. 
In a rampage late Sunday night that lasted roughly 10 minutes, according to authorities, Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags and damaged what the state calls the “world’s largest single-loom carpet” that is almost a century old in the state reception room. 
He is also accused of knocking over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. and damaging an electronic card reader for an elevator. The card reader has since been fixed, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
He sustained a cut on his left arm during the incident and was treated by Olympia Fire Department personnel on the scene. His right arm was in a cast at the time. 
Schubert was released from jail on Tuesday, Oct. 7, without needing to post bail. A judge found that bail was not necessary to secure his reappearance at court, but determined that several conditions of release were necessary. 
Undergoing a mental health evaluation was one of those conditions. Another prohibits him from visiting the Capitol campus without an official escort. 
He was also required to contact the court’s pretrial services department within two days of his release, but failed to do so, according to court documents. A violation report has been added to his record, but has not yet been addressed by a judge. 
An attorney representing Schubert confirmed Friday that he is in custody at an undisclosed location while he undergoes his mental health evaluation. 
Schubert’s possible motivation remains unclear. Some officials attributed his alleged actions to mental health issues. 
In videos posted to social media in the days leading up to the break-in, Schubert rambled through sometimes nonsensical rants. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions. 
Two weeks before allegedly vandalizing the Capitol, Schubert posted a photo inside the Capitol rotunda with one of those poetic captions. 
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck,  a Democrat, said Monday. But, Heck added, “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/George-Washington-bust-tipped-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

Free.,Judge weighs Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s release from immigration detention,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-weighs-kilmar-abrego-garcias-release-immigration-detention,,"GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge in Maryland seemed inclined to order the release of  Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention after oral arguments in court Friday, a potentially major development in the high-profile case.After a more than six-hour hearing, District Judge Paula Xinis said a witness provided by the Justice Department showed little evidence that the Trump administration made an effort to remove Abrego Garcia to the southern African nation of Eswatini, and knew nothing about Abrego Garcia agreeing to be removed to Costa Rica. The witness tapped by the Department of Justice was John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.After hearing from him, Xinis said keeping Abrego Garcia detained indefinitely would likely be unconstitutional. She said she would issue an order soon.Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania. His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.‘Three strikes, you’re out’Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia. “We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said. Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention. He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there. Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.Supreme Court rulingA 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them. After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis. Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August. Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.Protesters rally outside the courthouseAhead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.” Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!” Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”White House involvementSchultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia. The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House. While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini. Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway. “The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said. Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.  Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.Ghana another potential destinationSchultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia. “This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.The Costa Rica alternativeOne of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there. Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”William J.

The projected $56.6 million state budget deficit was calculated in the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report, which the Idaho Legislative Services Office released Friday. 
The Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed available revenue. 
However, the state’s top budget official told the Idaho Capital Sun late Friday afternoon that Gov. Brad Little will do what needs to be done to ensure the fiscal year 2026 budget balances. 
Little already ordered all state agencies – other than public schools – to cut their budgets by 3% before the end of the fiscal year June 30. A short time later, Little said those cuts will continue into 2027 and be made permanent. 
No decisions have been made, but state officials are discussing the possibility of additional cuts and deeper cuts, said Lori Wolff, administrator of the Idaho Division of Financial Management.
“Obviously we are watching this very closely and talking amongst the governor’s office staff about what we need to do to make sure we submit a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “We’ve already done the 3% holdbacks and are starting to examine other places where we may need to reduce expenses.”
 Through first quarter of fiscal year 2026 budget, revenue is 6.8% below forecast

Wolff said budget officials will brief Little this month and then he will prepare his gubernatorial budget request in November. 
Wolff said Little and the Division of Financial Management are committed to doing what it takes to avoid a budget deficit of any kind.
“We are continuing to watch revenues and make decisions to make sure whatever we submit is a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “At the same time we don’t want to overreact. This may correct itself, and we definitely don’t want to put too much weight into one month of revenue.”

Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. The October budget and revenue report covers the first three months – or first quarter – of the current fiscal year 2026.
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money available to spend on expenses in the state budget. The largest source of revenue is taxes.
Through the first three months of fiscal year 2026, revenues have come in $94.1 million, or 6.8%, below the revised revenue forecast issued by the Division of Financial Management, the new budget and revenue monitor report shows.
The revenue shortfalls are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little reduced revenue by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
 Idaho’s budget picture has changed since record surplus three years ago

News of a projected budget deficit is a big change for Idaho. 
A little over three years ago, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record state budget surplus estimated at $2 billion. 
The budget picture has even changed considerably since legislators adjourned the 2025 legislative session April 4, when they projected ending fiscal year 2026 with a positive ending balance of $439.8 million. 
But in the six months since legislators adjourned the session, that $439.8 million surplus has now become a projected deficit of $56.6 million, according to the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report.
Wolff emphasized that the state’s overall economy remains strong and rainy day budget reserve accounts are sitting at record levels. Wolff also pointed out that Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth announced Thursday that the financial investor services firm Moody’s Ratings just affirmed Idaho’s AAA credit rating.
Idaho is not the only state grappling with revenue shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special legislative session this summer, in part to address shrinking revenue, Colorado Newsline reported. Meanwhile, the Washington State Standard reported that state tax revenue in Washington is down by $500 million.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Dozens of Arkansas municipalities will continue to go without certain monthly allotments of state funds because they haven’t yet filed required audits of their water and sewer systems.
After a two-hour debate Friday, Arkansas lawmakers on the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee rejected a proposal to expunge a July vote to withhold “turnback funds” from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Seven legislators voted for the motion while eight voted against it and five voted present. Several members of the 35-member committee were absent.
The committee voted last month to give grace to the 40 cities and towns that still had not submitted their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024. Three cities had filed those reports, and two more had done so as of Friday, said Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, House chair of the committee’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee.
The committee’s September vote asked Treasurer John Thurston to release the funds and require each municipality to provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by Dec. 31.
However, that vote had no legal authority, according to an opinion issued Monday by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office. Thurston’s office requested the opinion after the committee’s vote in September. The opinion stated that only expunging the initial vote to withhold funds would allow Thurston to release them.

2025-096 
Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline and that the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
If those audits are not submitted, the committee may — but is not required to — direct the state treasurer to withhold turnback funds until the reports are submitted. However, once the treasurer is directed to withhold the funds, it is required to do so, Assistant Attorney General William Olson wrote in Monday’s opinion.

Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, proposed the failed motion to expunge the July vote. He insisted that the opinion “is not law until it goes to court and is proven in court” and that lawmakers do not have to take action that aligns with it even though he agreed with it.
Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, proposed that the committee release the turnback funds to municipalities “that are actively showing efforts” to submit their outstanding audit reports but to continue withholding funds from those that “have produced no evidence of actively complying with the law.”
Thirteen municipalities have shown no effort to submit their reports, said the committee’s House chair, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs.
“I’m struggling between grace, mercy and rewarding effort, but not rewarding those who are blatantly disregarding the law, because I think that is an injustice to the cities that have gotten the message and are making an effort,” Hammer said.
The committee rejected Hammer’s motion, which also would have required representatives of the noncompliant municipalities to appear before the committee at its next meeting. The motion failed by a similar margin as Ladyman’s.
Arkansas lawmakers agree to return withheld funds to 40 municipalities after two-hour debate

Most of the municipalities flagged for delinquent audit reports in July have populations of fewer than 1,000, Ladyman noted.
“[For] a city of 200 people that has to pay either $3,500 or $10,000 for an audit, that puts them in a bad situation, especially since they haven’t gotten turnback [funds] for two months,” Ladyman said. “That may be keeping them from complying.”
Local governments receive two types of turnback funds from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
Lundstrum reiterated her previous opposition to releasing the withheld funds from noncompliant entities.
“If they have a water and sewer department and you don’t pay your water bill, what happens?” she said. “You get your water cut off. At some point, they’ve got to be able to do an audit.”

Last month, Roshani, an Afghan case worker in Vermont, heard that her clients with Special Immigrant Visas would be losing access to food stamps. 
It has been a hard message to explain to them, she said.
It’s not just that her clients come to Vermont with few or no resources, said Roshani, whose real name is being withheld while she seeks asylum. Special Immigrant Visa holders are largely Afghans who were granted that status after assisting the U.S. government in their home country before American troops withdrew in 2021. They have come to the state as legal permanent residents. 
But Vermont’s interpretation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s language on the issue renders these visa holders ineligible for food stamps. Advocates are contesting the state’s reading, which they say appears to be among the first of its kind in the nation.
Roshani said cases of this kind make her “want to melt into the ground.” “They tell me, ‘Hey … do you know how I saved my boss in this war?’” she said.
Officials at the Vermont Department for Children and Families said federal law mandated the denial of food stamp eligibility to this group. Following the passage of the Trump administration’s spending bill in July, the state has begun implementing a sweeping set of changes to its version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The wider population of non-citizens has been significantly affected, with 119 households experiencing a partial or complete loss of benefits, according to the department’s most recent estimate.
But for most humanitarian entrants, a green card has been enough to keep food stamp access, due to exemptions in federal law. Special Immigrant Visa holders, who by programmatic design are seeking promised refuge from both conflict and persecution for past allegiance to the U.S., have lost benefit eligibility in Vermont even though most have green cards.
Federal guidance on issuance of Special Immigrant Visas lists one condition as an “ongoing serious threat as a consequence of employment” with the U.S. government or associated entity.
Tracy Dolan, director of the state’s Refugee Office, estimated that there might be 20 or 30 households with Special Immigrant Visas that would be affected by the eligibility change, but expressed some uncertainty around that figure.
A number of legal advocates have called the state’s position on Special Immigrant Visa holders into question, citing laws they said have been unaltered by the new federal budget.
“The part that we disagree with is Vermont’s interpretation of Afghan (and Iraqi) SIVs in particular,” said Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of policy and advocacy at Refugee Council USA. 
Edwards’ organization argues in its legal analysis — based on provisions in previous laws governing SNAP and federal guidance that has emerged since the creation of the Special Immigrant Visa program — that those visa holders should still qualify for food stamps without needing to satisfy other conditions.
Vermont’s position is different, according to Miranda Gray, deputy commissioner for the Economic Services Division of the Department for Children and Families. The department’s legal team concluded that under new federal law, Special Immigrant Visa holders are not entitled to that eligibility.
“We are feeling confident in our legal analysis,” Miranda Gray said. “We were essentially taking two different laws and seeing where they intersected.”
Molly Gray, the director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, called the state’s implementation an “unnecessarily cautious and narrow” reading that “seems incorrect,” citing similar arguments to Edwards.

For many of her organization’s clients, she said, food stamps are an indispensable part of the transition period rather than a permanent fixture. The changes may also affect her organization’s future plans to welcome more Special Immigrant Visa holders to the state, Molly Gray said.
“These individuals are arriving with no money and the clothes on their backs,” she said. 
‘Leading the charge’
In making these eligibility changes on Oct. 1, Vermont appears to be among only a few, if any, states to withhold benefits for Special Immigrant Visas in particular, according to officials and advocates. 
Agencies in a number of states across the country did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.
Vermont is “leading the charge” on implementing SNAP changes, according to Edwards. “That is one of the reasons it’s particularly important to ensure that Vermont falls on the right side of interpretation,” she said.
When asked for clarification of the state’s legal reasoning, Miranda Gray responded in an email that she was unable to provide more specific information or connect VTDigger with the department’s attorney.
Dolan said that Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa holders are now subject to a five-year waiting period for SNAP eligibility after arriving in the U.S. Essentially no Special Immigrant Visa holders in the state are currently eligible under that rule, Dolan said, because they would need to have been lawful permanent residents for at least five years. Vermont only began receiving such entrants in 2021, according to Dolan, with few exceptions. 
This five-year bar and its associated exemptions appear to originate in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act governing SNAP, according to Edwards, which predates the Special Immigrant Visa program by 15 years.
“The rationale for choosing to have one population eligible and another not in this situation is difficult to understand,” Dolan said. “There’s no doubt about that.”
The state has been under pressure to implement changes to SNAP quickly and with little margin for error, Miranda Gray said. In the background, threats of huge federal penalties loom if the state’s “error rate,” or percentage of misdirected funds under the new guidelines, is too high.
“We have to talk about the full picture,” Miranda Gray said.
One of the central shifts in the Trump administration’s transformation of SNAP is a greater financial burden on states as opposed to the federal government. Administrative costs, which used to be shared equally, will now be 75% covered by each state. But perhaps more crucially, the rate of administrative error will begin to determine how much each state will need to contribute to the direct cost of the benefits themselves.
An error rate of 6% or higher, just 0.87% above Vermont’s result last year, will result in the state being responsible for 5% of the program costs — up to $7.8 million in additional fees. Each successive error rate threshold would add another 5% in required coverage.
Miranda Gray said that kind of expense could result in major cuts elsewhere in the program. 
“I think that impacts, as well, how states are making decisions,” she said of the implementation process. 
All parties agree that a lack of federal guidance on the details of SNAP eligibility has hampered the process. Miranda Gray said part of the issue has been significant turnover and organizational changes at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Sonali Samarasinghe, director of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that communication around those on the margins of SNAP coverage has been hard to follow for providers and recipients alike.
“Everything is a little murky,” she said. “Guidance changes from day to day.”
Roshani said her clients had often received multiple letters, with one warning of a change in benefit amount, and another withdrawing benefits entirely.
Dolan said the state had requested federal clarification around non-citizen SNAP eligibility “pretty early on,” but that some instructions had not arrived on the promised timeline. The alterations began taking effect Oct. 1, coinciding with the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.   
“We would all benefit from more comprehensive guidance,” Dolan said.
‘A kind of betrayal’
Special Immigrant Visas of this type date back to early years in the United States’ war in Afghanistan, when new legislation sought to offer support to Afghan and Iraqi nationals who assisted the U.S. in its missions abroad. The document affords immigrants under these particular circumstances access to legal permanent residence in the United States. 
Afghans who worked with the U.S. have often faced persecution under the Taliban regime. In recent months, Afghan outlets have reported thousands of refugees have been forced to return home from Iran and Pakistan as the neighboring countries cited security concerns and strain on resources.
The vast majority of Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa population is Afghan, part of a community which is already reeling after President Donald Trump cut federal refugee resettlement programs in January. When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind tens of thousands — estimates including open cases have exceeded 150,000 — of Afghans who were entitled to visas as a result of their work.
In the period since official resettlement channels closed, other pathways to the U.S. for Special Immigrant Visa holders became available, most notably through the veteran-run nonprofit No One Left Behind. Vermont, among other states, has therefore continued to receive Afghan immigrants under these circumstances.
“The U.S. government should issue clear guidance to all states confirming that SIV holders remain eligible for nutrition assistance,” said a spokesperson for No One Left Behind in a statement on Friday. “Our allies kept their promise, and we must keep ours.”
Molly Gray said a lack of food stamps could threaten her organization’s ability to welcome newcomers in the Special Immigrant Visa program going forward.
The alliance assists new Afghan entrants with temporary housing, finding work, and a number of other necessities. But, “​​we don’t have any funding to support food assistance,” Molly Gray said.
“Afghans arriving in Vermont are not looking for a handout, they’re already working second shift,” she said.
The alliance’s purpose is not solely to fulfill a promise made to Afghan people, Molly Gray said, but also simultaneously to grow Vermont’s workforce and economy.
Ali Zenie, executive director of Central Vermont Refugee Action Network, said she was currently working with a family set to lose benefits based on their status as green card-holding Special Immigrant Visa recipients. Having arrived in March, the family’s financial situation has been difficult due to medical issues, and they have relied regularly on food assistance.
Because of religious dietary restrictions, Zenie continued, it has often been difficult to accept food in contexts where the family has not been doing its own shopping. The model of food stamps has allowed the family to accept support in a dignified manner that works for their specific needs. While Zenie hopes that an exemption for disability will allow the household to retain part of their monthly allowance, the case remains up in the air.
It’s crucial, Roshani said, to understand the circumstances that brought these individuals to the United States.
“We’re kind of neglecting the fact that we are receiving people from parts of the world that have experienced a lot of trauma,” Roshani said. 
Samarasinghe said that in the context of their life-threatening support of the U.S. back home, these cuts are especially bewildering.
“I think what it means for them is a kind of betrayal,” she said.

The Missoula County Attorney’s Office has charged a 29-year-old man with a felony hate crime after he allegedly assaulted another man in downtown Missoula because he was Jewish, according to county officials.
Authorities are hoping other people who witnessed the assault will come forward with more information.
According to Missoula authorities, at around 1:30 p.m., Tuesday, Missoula Police went to the 1100 block of West Broadway on a report of an assault. Once they arrived there, they saw a man with “obvious injuries” who was bleeding from the face. They received a description of a man who had allegedly beaten the victim, and found Michael Cain not far away.
Based on statements and other evidence obtained by officers, the police believe that Cain had assaulted the victim because he had been motivated by the victim’s religious, ethnic or cultural identity of belonging to the Jewish religious community.
Cain was arrested and is being held at the Missoula County Detention facility on the charge of malicious intimidation or harassment relating to civil or human rights, a felony. This is often referred to as a “hate crime.”

Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions to a local school board, building governing entity or the Building Authority Division. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
The state has eleven, four-year public universities, according to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. The Advocate emailed all of them Friday, and the University of Arkansas Fayetteville is the only one that confirmed receipt of donated posters. 
Arkansas school district responses to Ten Commandments law mixed

“The University recently received about 500 donated posters of the ‘Ten Commandments’ and is beginning to install the posters in university buildings and facilities as required under Act 573 of 2025,” said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications.
Spokespeople for Arkansas State University, Henderson State University, University of Arkansas – Fort Smith, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and University of Central Arkansas all confirmed they had not received donations as of Friday.
Nate Hinkel, director of communications for the University of Arkansas System, also confirmed no donations had been made to UA Grantham, an online public university based at the UA System’s Cammack Campus in Little Rock.  
Arkansas Tech University, Southern Arkansas University and University of Arkansas at Monticello did not respond to requests for comment by publication. 
The new state law faced its first legal challenge in June when a group of families of varying religious backgrounds filed a lawsuit against four Northwest Arkansas school districts. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks temporarily blocked the law at the four districts on Aug. 4, one day before it was set to take effect. 
The Conway School District in Central Arkansas was later added to the suit, and Brooks ordered Ten Commandments posters already displayed in the district to be removed in late August. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a notice of appeal on Sept. 23. Brooks last week denied the attorney general’s motion to stay proceedings pending the appeal and a motion for a 30-day extension of upcoming deadlines due to two lawyers’ “personal obligations and heavy workload.”
“These excuses do not constitute good cause to stay the Court’s deadline,” Brooks wrote. “The deadlines are perfectly reasonable, and the Attorney General’s Office is not short of staff to litigate this case.”
The state’s appellant brief is due Nov. 17, according to a scheduling order.

Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.


No tax on tips, a campaign promise by President Donald Trump, is now part of the U.S. tax code, but experts across the political spectrum see limited benefits for California workers.
The Treasury Department and the IRS late last month released details of their proposed regulations around the new tax deduction, which Republicans included in their spending bill. 
Under the provision, taxpayers who make less than $150,000 a year, or $300,000 if filing jointly, could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions. Among the nearly 70 occupations that qualify are restaurant servers, gig workers, barbers, cosmetologists and golf caddies. The deduction is effective starting this tax year and runs through 2028. The public can submit comments to the IRS until Oct. 22. 
Workers and experts who spoke with CalMatters about no tax on tips had more questions than answers, because income tax outcomes can vary significantly depending on people’s circumstances. Are they single, married filing separately or married filing jointly? Do they have kids? Do they deduct mileage or other expenses? Experts also said the provision brings up issues of fairness: Some low-wage service workers will get deductions that workers with comparable wages in other industries won’t get. 
“I would be hard-pressed to think of a stupider tax policy that’s become law,” said Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley whose focus includes taxes. 
Galle said the provision makes taxes even more complicated. He also said it could lead some employers to cut workers’ pay “by the full amount of tax savings.” 
Meanwhile, polls show consumers are tired of tipping, so they might stop doing so if they assume that all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips, Galle and other experts said. 
In addition, for some workers the deduction may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.
“It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill and how disproportionately it’s helping rich folks at the expense of low-income folks,” said Kayla Kitson, senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. “Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”
What workers think
Dale Randle, a self-employed barber in Fairfield, a Bay Area suburb, thinks he could take advantage of the new deduction. But he doesn’t know how much in tips he will actually receive.
“It’s kind of hard, because everybody doesn’t tip,” he said. “It’s hit or miss, there’s no consistency. I might go a whole week without someone giving me a tip.”
Also, business has been slow since the pandemic’s onset five years ago, because lots of new barbers have oversaturated the market since then, he said. Data from the state confirms that: Barbers licenses issued this fiscal year totaled 42,958, a 33% increase from fiscal year 2019-20. Business has been especially bad in the past several months, Randle said. 
“The benefit of this (deduction) will depend on how good business is,” he said. “Business is slow, so I can’t count on something that’s not there.”
That’s in line with a Yale Budget Lab analysis that not taxing tips may not benefit more than a third of tipped workers because they do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Crissie Brown said she makes about $95,000 to $100,000 a year from being a server at two different restaurants in Alameda. She said she’ll probably have to hire a tax preparer to see if she could benefit from the new deduction, but she’s skeptical because she doesn’t believe the Trump administration is “looking out for the working class at all.” 
“With the economy, I still live pretty poorly,” Brown said. “I can’t even afford to pay what I owe (in taxes) now.” She said keeping tips tax-free “sounds good, but I have a feeling it will bite us” in the end.
Only tips that are given voluntarily by customers will count toward the deduction. That means restaurant servers will not be able to deduct service charges that some restaurants automatically apply to diners’ checks. 
California food service workers’ reliance on tips vary. In September, 27% of bartenders’ income came from tips, according to payment-processing company Square, which analyzed payroll data from more than 100,000 employees. Full-service restaurant workers’ tips made up about 17% of their income last month, just like cafe workers. For workers at quick-service restaurants where there is no table service, tips were about 11% of their income.
Trump said he got the idea for no tax on tips from a Nevada restaurant server who complained about taxes she had to pay on tips. The union that represents Las Vegas food and hospitality workers is mostly supportive of the new deduction, though it has some complaints about the details.
As for gig workers, they might see uneven benefits from the new deduction, said Sergio Avedian, a ride-hailing driver in Los Angeles and a contributor at the gig-work blog Rideshare Guy. 
“For drivers, who often rely on tips to offset low base pay, this could feel like an immediate raise,” Avedian said. But he added that the new deduction may not benefit drivers much because he thinks only 15% to 20% of Uber and Lyft riders tip. He said the deduction could be more beneficial for food-delivery drivers, such as those who deliver for DoorDash, while it would probably not help Amazon Flex workers who don’t typically get tips. 
More than 53% of food-delivery drivers’ income is from tips, according to 2024 data from Gridwise Analytics, which is based on information from more than 260,000 drivers. Tips made up only about 10% of ride-hailing drivers’ pay, while for couriers who deliver packages that number was less than 4%.
Avedian also said gig workers have to pay self-employment tax, so that could eat into any benefit of the new tip deduction — again, if the workers qualify for it at all, depending on their income. 
Almost 40% of taxi and ride-hailing drivers nationwide are on Medicaid or receive health care subsidies, according to Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In California, those drivers could be among the more than 1 million people expected to lose Medi-Cal coverage under new work-hour requirements in the Republican spending bill.
Fairness and other issues
The uneven effect of the deduction will apply to other industries, according to analyses by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. Both think tanks criticized no tax on tips during the 2024 presidential election, when both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed it. They said it has “no other redeeming quality” and that only some low-wage workers will get the tax deduction.
Another way the deduction is unfair is that it has a marriage penalty, said Andrew Gradman, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles County. 
“If two tipped workers are married, they can only claim $25,000, while a single person would get to claim $25,000,” he said.
Another possible problem: Because the new deduction introduces even more complexity to tax law, some workers risk committing tax fraud or being accused of it, Gradman said. 
If someone works for an institutional employer, “they’re going to have accountants who will do the heavy lifting,” he said, and that could help taxpayers know whether they qualify for the deduction. “If you get your paycheck from Patreon or whatever, it’s gonna be burdensome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/041624_San-Ysidro-Border-Economy_AH_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s longest-serving death row inmate died this week in a prison infirmary of natural causes, the Department of Corrections said Friday.
Fred Singleton, 81, died Monday, according to an online post by the agency that oversees the state’s prisons. He was one of 25 inmates on death row at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia after executions resumed in September 2024. The state prisons agency, in its statement, did not explain why it waited four days to notify the public of Singleton’s death.

A jury convicted Singleton in 1983 of raping and strangling 73-year-old widow Elizabeth Lominick to death in Newberry County the year before. Officers had arrested Singleton in Georgetown County with her car, her diamond and gold jewelry, and about $100 of her money, according to court records.
However, Singleton couldn’t be executed because the state Supreme Court found him mentally incompetent. In the 1993 opinion deciding Singleton’s mental state meant he couldn’t face the death chamber, justices set the standard still used today for what makes a death row inmate able to face execution.
Singleton didn’t understand that he could die in the electric chair, which was the default execution method at the time. He could only respond to attorneys’ questions with a “yes” or “no,” making it difficult to communicate, his appeals lawyers argued to the court.
Although the court agreed Singleton shouldn’t face execution, justices also decided a judge couldn’t reverse Singleton’s sentence because the court couldn’t be sure his condition was permanent, according to the opinion.
Medication might have rendered Singleton competent, but justices decided officials couldn’t force Singleton to take medicine for the sake of his execution, according to court records.
Singleton spent the rest of his life on death row.
The next longest-serving inmate is Jamie Wilson, whose case also remains in legal limbo because of questions over his competence.
As executions continue in SC, these inmates can’t receive death warrants

Wilson, convicted in 1989 of killing two 8-year-old girls in a school shooting the year prior, pleaded guilty but mentally ill before receiving a death sentence. His attorneys argued during a 2004 hearing that he was incompetent for execution, but a judge has yet to issue a decision.
Six inmates have been put to death since South Carolina resumed executions last year following a 13-year hiatus. Two more received judgments deeming them competent for execution but are appealing the decisions.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

The state agency that administers New Mexico’s food stamps program says as many as 32,000 residents’ eligibility could be impacted next month by new federal rules.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed July 4 contains many changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, but most don’t go into effect until next year or later.
But Nov. 1, the bill will change how energy assistance payments are applied to SNAP eligibility determinations, according to an announcement Wednesday from the state Health Care Authority. 
Before the bill, states like New Mexico would automatically lower a household’s calculated income by a standard amount if the household received assistance from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. 
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

The deduction is important because it affects how much SNAP benefits a household receives. According to the federal Agriculture Department the standard deduction in New Mexico’s, known as the Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowance, is $408. 
However, thanks to the law, that deduction is only automatic for households with members aged 60 or over or those with a disability.. SNAP recipients without those household members will have to jump through other hurdles, including showing utility bills, to receive the deduction. 
HCA officials said the office will provide assistance to recipients with questions about the change. 
“We’re reaching out early so families have time to prepare,”Niki Kozlowski, Income Support Division director at the HCA said in a statement. “If you’re unsure how this affects you, please contact us now, before your next renewal date, so we can walk you through what you may need to provide.” 
The change goes into effect for new benefit applications or renewals beginning Nov. 1. The new requirements don’t affect current SNAP benefits before then, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Washington has abandoned its effort to force Catholic priests and other religious leaders to divulge information on child abuse and neglect they learn of in confession.
With a pair of legal filings, the state agreed not to enforce the controversial provision of a new state law that adds clergy to a list of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.” 
Stipulations filed in federal court on Friday will largely preserve the law, while casting aside the controversial component related to confessions. Catholic bishops and Orthodox churches sued over that element, arguing it was unconstitutional.
The agreements the state reached in those cases reflect the preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge that has prevented the state and counties from enforcing the confessional reporting provision since the law took effect July 27.
Lawmakers approved the law during this year’s legislative session, and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it in May.
The Trump administration had also weighed in on the case, siding with the churches.
In the case brought by three Catholic bishops, U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosures on information learned in confession infringed on their First Amendment right to practice religion and would force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
State attorneys concluded that, given the judge’s reasoning, settling the legal fights now was the best possible outcome.
“It keeps crucial portions of Washington’s mandatory reporting law in place, while also preserving the Legislature’s authority to address issues with the law identified by the court,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. 
Catholic leaders and their lawyers celebrated the legal victory.
“Preventing abuse and upholding the sacred seal of confession are not mutually exclusive — we can and must do both,” said Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference.
“That’s why the Church supported the law’s goal from the beginning and only asked for a narrow exemption to protect the sacrament,” she said. “We’re grateful the state ultimately recognized it can prevent abuse without forcing priests to violate their sacred vows.”
Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of several firms involved in the case, called the state’s decision to settle “a victory for religious freedom and for common sense. Priests should never be forced to make the impossible choice of betraying their sacred vows or going to jail.”
But a leader of a group that works to assist individuals abused by clergy members criticized the outcome.
“There are some fights worth fighting for. This is one of them,” said Mary Dispenza of the Catholic Accountability Project. “Priests are not above the law. This secrecy or ‘priest privilege’ fails children and keeps perpetrators safe — able to molest and assault children again and again. The federal judge who blocked [Senate Bill] 5375 is putting the law above the life and protection of children.”
Senate Bill 5375 added clergy to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Tacoma in May, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants. The Orthodox Church in America, along with other churches and individual priests, filed a similar case in federal court in Spokane in June.
Both cases and stipulations are now in front of Judge Estudillo in Tacoma. If he signs both orders, they will go into effect and the cases will end.
The stipulations do not require any action by the Legislature, said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Attorney General Brown. It does not foreclose lawmakers addressing pieces of the law the court found problematic if they want, he said.
Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.” State attorneys consulted the governor before deciding to file stipulations in each case.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, wrote the new law, which represents years of effort to add clergy to the state’s list of mandatory reporters.
“My goal all along with this bill has just been to protect children, and I hope that closing the book on this lawsuit allows for that to happen,” she said in an email. 
“Children need to know that when they go to a trusted adult in their life to ask for help, like a member of the clergy, they get help,” Frame said. “That’s how we break the cycle of abuse and do better by our next generation.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington’s new sales tax on services faces a second lawsuit that could undercut the state’s moves to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
A Sequim-based security company is suing to pause the tax on its services that took effect last week. 
Security Services Northwest wants the state’s tax on security services blocked until Jan. 1, arguing its implementation moved too quickly and violated due process. The company filed the 6-page lawsuit Sept. 30 in Thurston County Superior Court, with the state, the Department of Revenue and agency director Drew Shirk named as defendants.
A Department of Revenue spokesperson declined to comment on the complaint, other than to say the agency “is reviewing the lawsuit with legal counsel.”
The law in question expanded taxes on a number of services and is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and over $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds. 
Other services covered by the tax law include live presentations, information technology and temporary staffing. 
The levy on investigation, security and armored car services makes up $127 million of the anticipated four-year collections, according to the Department of Revenue. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Security Services Northwest provides security officers, remote video monitoring and security alarm installation. 
Senate Bill 5814, signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson in May, already faces litigation from cable giant Comcast over a separate provision targeting digital advertising services for taxation. Comcast says the statute violates federal law because it doesn’t apply the tax to all advertising services equally.
Late last month, the state filed its response to Comcast in court, disagreeing with the allegations and asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing in the case could be months away. 
The advertising services tax is projected to bring in $475 million to state coffers over the next two budget cycles. 
The lawsuits bring into question new revenue that state lawmakers relied upon to fill a gaping budget shortfall and fund a $77.8-billion two-year operating budget. The challenged law is part of a package of new and increased taxes and fees that Democrats in the Legislature pushed through this year in hopes of raising $9 billion in the next four years.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with businesses covered by the new taxes on services. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects on their bottom line. 
Ahead of the law’s Oct. 1 implementation, the Department of Revenue released detailed guidance on companies’ obligations, including on Sept. 12 for security services. Included in the tax are private investigators, bounty hunters, security guards, fingerprinting, background checks, missing person tracking and lie detectors and polygraphs.
Security Services Northwest says in the lawsuit that this wasn’t enough time to “adapt to and implement internal controls and procedures to ensure that proper sales tax is charged.”
Department of Revenue spokesperson Mikhail Carpenter said the state notified all businesses set to pay the new tax via letter or email between Aug. 13 and Aug. 22. Notices of the changes were also issued in late July, around the time of the listening sessions. 
The company also takes issue with the tax itself, calling it a “direct tax on public safety” in a press release. And it argues that security services are being taxed unfairly compared to other professional services. 
“This policy punishes communities trying to stay safe and makes protection less affordable for everyone,” Joe D’Amico, the company’s president, said in a statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

But campus was relatively quiet when it went into effect Friday.,"For much of the last two years, tensions have been elevated on the campus of Yale University, where students protested the Israel-Hamas war with signs, flags and encampments.
But the campus was relatively quiet following the long-awaited announcement of a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. A permanent ceasefire had been a cornerstone demand of Yale protesters. 
On Friday, as the agreement took effect, Yale students said they felt a mix of relief and trepidation about how it would play out. Students said that on campus and online, there was little activity from their peers — on either side of the issue. Some advocates said they planned to continue their activism.
President Donald J. Trump brokered the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza after weeks of negotiations and help from Arab and Muslim allies. The war began after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted over 250 others. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced most of the population of Gaza and leveled vast areas.
The conflict hit close to home for many students on higher education campuses in the United States, and protests have gripped college communities around the country since the fighting began. Yale was no exception.
Alex Greene, a Yale senior and president of the Peace and Dialogue Leadership Initiative — an educational fellowship that takes Yale and West Point students to Israel, the West Bank and East Jerusalem — said he’s not optimistic about peace prospects in the Middle East because the conflict is so entrenched. 
“Some of the underlying problems are still not addressed,” Greene, who described himself as a political moderate, said. As a result, he said, he expects that “pro-Palestinian protests are not going away. It may not be about the war in Gaza, it may be about the West Bank or something else.”
Still, Greene said he’d seen “surprisingly little” online discourse about the ceasefire, except “maybe a few peers” posting about the return of hostages, specifically videos capturing celebrations in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.
Yale senior Arjun Warrior, an organizer with Yale’s Endowment Justice Collective — which advocates for ethical distribution of university funds, and has recently researched ties between Yale and Israel — said pro-Palestinian student advocates “feel determined” and will “keep fighting.” 
In a text message, Warrior said the collective remains focused on other long-term goals such as divestment from military weapons manufacturers. “I feel relief, but also grief and uncertainty. This ceasefire is far too late and may not last,” Warrior wrote.
Student protesters at the University of Connecticut also said the ceasefire would not put an end to their activism. A group known as UConn Divest said in a statement that it “understands the ‘ceasefire’ as nothing but empty words to refocus media attention.” 
“So long as the people live under the harshest of conditions, we will continue to fight for them,” the group’s statement read.
On Wednesday, the day before the Israeli Cabinet approved Trump’s deal framework, student protesters staged a “die-in,” lying down on Yale’s Cross Campus green holding pictures of slain Palestinians.
Since the ceasefire went into effect, Yale’s pro-Palestinian activist groups have not posted publicly.
Roee Benya, a Yale junior from Israel, said he is cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire. “Obviously this is great news,” he said. “The most important thing for me as an Israeli is the hostages, bringing them back.”
Benya said he hasn’t seen any visible change at Yale relating to the ceasefire, but he said he thought there might be some next week when Hamas is expected to return the Israeli hostages.
“There has basically been a division in the Yale community between the Palestinian and Israeli camps, and it should have never been like that,” he said. “I hope that a ceasefire will naturally enable getting back to the framework of discussing this conflict.”

A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the case, seeking dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing in the case — which is scheduled, according to conflicting court records, on either Nov. 5, 2026, or Nov. 5, 2027.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef file a petition last month in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of the decision.
With that matter still pending before the court, the administrative law judge has agreed to stay any proceedings in the disciplinary case until there’s a court ruling on the summary judgment issue.
In his court petition, Wassef alleges all of the charges against him are “related to alleged violations of federal regulations codifying patient privacy rules.”
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
The Board of Medicine has yet to file a response to Wassef’s court petition.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had “committed multiple violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,” the federal law that includes patient privacy regulations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.” The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Oct. 22, 2025.

(USDA photo / Christopher Willis)The Montana Department of Commerce is set to divvy out $300,000 in agritourism grant funding following the passage of legislation this session.
The agency is taking applications for the program until Oct. 23 and it’s the second cycle of funding for agritourism in the state, commerce spokesperson Mitch Staley wrote in an email. The funding started in 2023 and was reupped as part of Senate Bill 405, brought by Montana Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, this past session. 
“Especially in some of the more dry land areas, diversifying how they get their income helps alleviate a lot of the risk that some of these farmers, ranchers face with bad weather years,” Zolnikov said during a Senate Finance and Claims meeting earlier this year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines agritourism as “farm services for recreation (such as hunting or fishing), hospitality (such as overnight accommodations), or entertainment (such as festivals or petting zoos)” which it says generated $1.26 billion in revenue for farms and ranches around the country in 2022. 
This is extra revenue beyond whatever they are generating from farming or cattle ranching operations. America’s farms contributed about $222 billion total to the U.S. economy in 2023.
A new nonprofit, the Montana Agritourism Association, works closely with producers around the state.

“Our work is a producer-led knowledge hub, helping farmers, ranchers and producers open their gates to visitors safely and successfully, connecting them with training, resources and partners across Montana,” said Debbie Queen, an agritourism specialist with the organization. “We focus on three things producers tell us matter most: business fundamentals, safety and risk awareness, and a great guest experience. When those are in place, everybody wins—hosts, visitors, and the local economy.”
A 2024 survey of Montana producers found that 71% said agritourism strengthens their ability to keep working their land, the organization states.
Individual grants are worth up to $50,000, presenters said.
“We’re encouraging projects and activities of all sizes. The intent is to help farmers and ranchers diversify revenue options through a new or enhanced agritourism activity,” Susan Joy, a program specialist with the Department of Commerce said during the presentation. “The grants are also meant to support activities in rural, under visited and tribal locations throughout Montana that will generate tourism revenue for the benefit of your local economy.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/50432161802_dace50f690_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines Area Community College board officials will consider next week whether to implement a search for an interim president after two of three candidates for the position withdrew from consideration.
Members of the community college’s presidential search committee met Friday to lay out next steps in the presidential search process, starting with questions of whether, and how, to select an interim president. Current DMACC President Rob Denson is set to retire at the end of the year, and two of the three finalists who were expected to come to campus this month for interviews withdrew their bids for the job, the college announced Wednesday.

While no decisions will be made on the search for an interim or permanent president without full board of directors approval, search consultant Larry Ebbers suggested extending the main search into the spring with the goal of starting a new president July 1, with an interim to lead the college in the meantime.
Ebbers reiterated during the meeting that the candidates who pulled out did so for personal reasons, and not because of anything to do with DMACC, and the third candidate told him they would be willing to remain one as the search is extended. He said the mid-year timing of the start date was an issue brought up by candidates.
“Both of them commented to me in their letters of withdrawal that in fact, they thought DMACC was an excellent school and an excellent opportunity, and they were withdrawing for personal reasons only,” Ebbers said.
The DMACC board of directors will conduct its regular meeting Oct. 13, board President Kevin Halterman said, and members will vote on Ebbers’ recommendation to “cultivate additional candidates” and to work with him on an interim president search.
Ebbers said he plans to recommend the board hire an interim president for the period of Jan. 1 to June 30, with the new president scheduled to start July 1. Interviews for additional nominations to the role would take place in late February and early March.
“I’m very comfortable we’ll be able to find a really good president,” Ebbers said. “There’s no question in my mind about that.”
A screening committee of DMACC and other community college officials narrowed down the initial list of more than 50 candidates to six people before handing the names to the presidential search committee to identify finalists, said board member Denny Presnall during the meeting.
Presnall said he was disappointed to hear the now-former candidates hadn’t figured out whether they could make the job work for them by the time they were in the top three, and that the screening committee had eliminated so many people before coming to the search committee.
The presidential search committee can be the group to screen new crops of candidates, Ebbers said, if the board would rather not use a separate screening committee. In searches like this, the initial candidate pool should have a wide range of backgrounds and experience, and Ebbers said that through the first iteration of the search, it’s been made clear that experience in a community college is paramount.
Board member Trish Roberts said anyone who makes it far enough in the selection process should be asked whether they are a “serious candidate,” as it was disheartening to see this happen.
“I understand Denny’s frustration, because we did have good candidates,” Roberts said.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, urged Senate colleagues to pass a budget resolution to reopen the government and reduce risk of an aviation disaster.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Moran, urged Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown that exacerbates the shortage of air traffic controllers. He argued  reopening government would reduce the risk that personnel or equipment failures could lead to an aviation disaster. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran sounded an alarm that the ongoing federal government shutdown threatened to break the nation’s “fragile” aviation system.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate’s subcommittee on aviation, space and innovation, made reference to the Jan. 29 crash of a commercial jet from Wichita that collided with a military helicopter in crowded airspace above Washington, D.C.
“Our system is too fragile, and the stakes are too high, for us to continue operating the national aviation system in the manner we are doing so,” Moran said. “We will reach a breaking point, and this could result in the closing of our airspace or portions of it.”
He said he never found value in government shutdowns and urged Senate Democrats to collaborate with Republicans to pass a short-term budget resolution so people could return to their jobs and government work could resume.
The budget impasse prompting closure of nonessential elements of the government reached its 10th day on Friday.
There has been concern that continuation of the political dispute could undermine operation of U.S. airports. Air traffic controllers and TSA officers are considered essential employees and required to work during this period without timely paychecks. The existing national shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by illness of personnel during the shutdown, has been responsible for an increase in flight delays.
“Every day we remain in a shutdown, the air traffic controller shortage gets worse and the strain on the aviation system intensifies,” the senator said in a Senate floor speech. “I hope that this dysfunction we are undergoing … stops before we see dramatic and damaging consequences.”
The U.S. House passed a resolution to keep the government open, but the U.S. Senate hasn’t found the votes to mirror that step.
Moran said failure to “pass a continuing resolution is slowly crushing our aviation system.”
In January, American Airlines Flight 5342 and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided mid-air over the Potomac River. The incident near the Reagan National Airport killed 67 people aboard both aircraft, including 64 passengers and crew on the airliner. The jet had departed from Eisenhower National Airport in Wichita.
“We should be doing everything we can to make certain that our air traffic system and the necessary components are in place to make sure that the traveling public has a safe and secure flight when they board a plane in the United States,” he said. “That work is significantly hindered without an open and functioning government.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U.S.-Sen.-Jerry-Moran-aviation-1024x532.png,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

Josh Shapiro's official residence Sunday, is escorted from his first court appearance Monday, April 14, 2025. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Harrisburg man accused of firebombing the Governor’s Residence in April is set to appear in the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas on Tuesday. He faces 50 felony and misdemeanor charges including attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses in connection with the incident.
Cody Balmer, 38, last appeared in magisterial district court April 14, where he pleaded not guilty and District Judge Dale Klein denied Balmer’s attorney’s request for bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released.
Court records list the appearance next week as “plea court.” The Dauphin County district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the proceeding. 
Neither Balmer’s public defender nor the governor’s office immediately responded to a request for comment.
Balmer turned himself in after allegedly setting off Molotov cocktails in the Governor’s Residence on the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday. Shapiro and his family were sleeping inside. No one was harmed, but the Governor’s Residence suffered major damage.
Following the incident, Balmer called police to turn himself in and told a 911 dispatcher that he “will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Shapiro had faced criticism for his support of Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the militant group Hamas, which led to the war in Gaza that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians. Shapiro also pushed the University of Pennsylvania to quell student protests over Israel’s response.
Shapiro is the highest-ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Following his arrest, Balmer’s mother told reporters that her son suffered from mental illness, though Balmer denied this at a hearing in April.
In August, Balmer waived his preliminary hearing. He is currently being held in Dauphin County Prison.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4081-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

Officials with Canyon County announced on Friday that the first section of a new boat ramp at the park was installed. The new project marks the first construction phase of a two-phase process that has been in the works for two years, according to a Canyon County press release. The boat ramp is closed for the season and is not operational while the project continues.
“This has been a huge undertaking and something we are very excited about,” said Nichole Schwend, Canyon County parks director, in the press release. “It’s the first major boater improvement to the park in 30 years.”
The first phase of the project will cost around $600,000, while the second phase is expected to cost around $275,000, the press release said. The project’s cost is offset by two Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation Waterways Improvement Fund grants, which together covered the entire cost of phase one, according to the release.
Schwend said in the release that part of the reason the project took two years to get to this point was to ensure that the new boat ramp would not cause harm to the area or impact archaeological sites.
“Maintaining and preserving the park’s history and archaeology is of the utmost importance,” Schwend said in the release.
Celebration Park, which was established as Idaho’s only archaeological park in 1989, features huge basalt melon gravels deposited by the Bonneville flood that revel petroglyphs believed to be 100 to 10,000 years old. Free guided tours are available during the park’s visitor center hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Mental Health Department will need an extra $20 million legislative appropriation to cover some costs in the current budget year. 
And in addition to its current state appropriation of $403 million, the agency says it’s requesting an extra $79.5 million in the upcoming budget year. This will cover $20 million in Medicaid matching costs for both the current and upcoming budget year,  $22.5 million in IT software upgrades and $17 million to implement a court agreement to fix the state’s competency restoration system and to cover any related fines for noncompliance.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ $20 million fiscal year 2026 supplemental budget request will cover the agency’s share of Medicaid matching costs, which is the state’s share of the program’s funding. It comes after the agency already received an extra $27.4 million appropriation from the Legislature and as officials continue to cut or eliminate contracts with mental health and substance abuse providers .
The agency was not yet able to provide a number Friday identifying the total scope of these cuts. 
Rep. Carl Newton, R-Cherokee, said Friday he wasn’t familiar with the details of the agency’s budget request, but he’s not surprised that a supplemental appropriation is needed. 
Newton, chair of the House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee and a member of a select committee investigating the department’s finances, said he doesn’t think the Legislature would be opposed to an additional appropriation. 
“We planned on doing a supplemental but we had to make a budget,” he said. “It’s our constitutional responsibility to get (the budget) done by May, and so we get that, but we knew that if they could get a handle on the budget, we’d probably have to add some more to that. But we wanted at least have something to get to them to get started.”
In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
In an attempt to right-size the agency’s budget, at least 300 line items, or parts of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, said the cuts “brought spending in line” with the agency’s budget. However, the agency is still receiving invoices for the 2025 budget year. He said that’s a “remnant of past practices” where funding from the current budget year paid for costs from previous years. 
The agency is also struggling to implement a legislatively-approved court settlement that requires the agency to provide improved competency restoration services on a set timeline. The state fell short of the agreed standards during their first compliance check. The settlement sets forth financial penalties for noncompliance.
The Mental Health Department cannot publicly identify a dollar amount for the total scope of contract cuts needed to correct spending until all of these invoices have been received, an agency spokesperson said. 
“Every program has a personal story behind it,” Slavonic said in a statement.  “We understand how much peer support and community services mean to the people they’ve helped. But our responsibility is to fund programs that align with our behavioral health mission, meet statutory requirements and stay within the budget provided by the Legislature.” 
The agency’s contracting process has been “reformed” to ensure a more competitive bidding process with an open request for proposals system, according to a news release. 
“Stabilizing the budget was one of my top priorities, but it’s only part of the story,” Slavonic said. “Reorganization, transparency and meeting our consent decree milestones are equally important. We’re proving that good stewardship and good care go hand in hand.” 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s concerned by the latest budget numbers provided and wants to be sure what data this budget request is based on. She said she needs a better idea of what the agency needs and specifics of their plan for providers. 
“We need a lot more solidity,” she said. “But mental health care does not stay stagnant, so I mean, costs go up and down based on challenges folks are facing. So it’s going to be very hard. We have to look at averages. We have to look at it over time. So I hope they’re using historic data to help inform them”
Kirt said she would like to take action before session begins in February, potentially through a special session. 
“I would love to do a supplemental sooner because I think if these cuts are about cash flow, we need to take care of that,” she said. “If they’re not willing to do a special session … make it be one of the first things we do when session opens.”

State Superintendent Lance Evans and his executive team made a case at the hearings for their $3.38 billion appropriation request from the Legislature this coming year, while senators subtly signaled their support for the state’s public education system. It could foreshadow a fight between the House and Senate in the 2026 legislative session, as the House leadership makes a full-court press for expanding “school choice” and using public money for private education options.
Over the course of two days, Wendy Clemons, the Mississippi Department of Education’s chief academic officer, and Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer, gave a detailed account of the public education system’s successes over the past 10 years, including increased graduation rates and higher elementary reading and math scores.
A decade ago, Mississippi had some the nation’s lowest fourth-grade reading scores. That changed in 2019 when the state began making headlines for having the most gains in the country in fourth-grade reading.

ExcelinEd’s senior policy fellow Christy Hovanetz moderated the first hearing on Thursday, and said the state’s educational progress is a direct result of targeted policy decisions and funding investment, such as the 2013 literacy act that established a third-grade reading test and drastically changed how reading is taught in Mississippi. MDE has also pushed districts to adopt and teach using “high-quality instructional materials.”
“Mississippi is a national story,” she said. “Be proud of your success. You have done amazing things for students and your state.” 
But there’s more work to do, officials said. 
The agency hopes to build on the work of the literacy act, expanding it into grades 4-8. Data shows that despite “miraculous” growth in reading proficiency among fourth graders, it’s challenging to sustain those gains through eighth grade. Increased math proficiency, too, is a focus for the education department.
And while the state has ramped up teacher recruitment, Mississippi still faces a teacher shortage. That’s largely due to low pay, Vanderford said. 
Though legislators gave teachers a pay raise in 2022, health insurance increases almost immediately absorbed the extra money. Nearby states also have increased teacher pay in recent years. Adjusted for cost of living, the agency says Mississippi’s teacher pay — at $54,200 — is ranked 46th out of 49 states, as of May 2024.
That means Mississippi, once again, is near the bottom.

Legislators seemed surprised to hear that the agency’s accountability model, the system by which schools and districts are measured, was recently revamped to include more college and career standards and is already being implemented across the state. As a result, Vanderford said, we’ll likely see fewer A- and B-rated schools this coming year. 
That’s not an indication that student learning is getting worse, though. This year, there were some A-rated districts with less than half of students proficient in reading or math. The revisions to the accountability model are in effort to increase those proficiency levels, Vanderford said.
The agency also plans to focus on decreasing chronic absenteeism, which is defined as missing 10% of the school year, or 18 days, in Mississippi. Since the pandemic, those absentee rates have seen a significant uptick, according to MDE data. 
Moving forward, the agency will set up consistent systems for documenting absenteeism, emphasize graduation success rather than dropout prevention and build outreach systems to intervene earlier when students start missing school. 
Those efforts will likely also implement the work the agency is doing to support low-performing districts, especially the four struggling “districts of transformation” that the state has taken over. 
“We have no intention of losing momentum,” Evans said at the end of the hearings. “I personally feel the full weight of everything we’ve talked about. I live it every day, and I impose that on the people at the department. 
“We’re not satisfied with where we are. We’re the type of people who will never be satisfied with where we are.”

Senators peppered the education leaders with questions through the two days of presentations, pressing officials on early education initiatives and what they were doing to help the state’s lowest- and highest-achieving students.
Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, said the committee would likely meet again on Oct. 28. 
“We’re on the right track,” he said in closing remarks. “As we move forward, we are hesitant to make major changes in the way we operate. These minor tweaks are necessary. We’re going to keep pushing you as a department to make these changes. We’re here to work with you and give you the tools you need to support these districts.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09143236/3X0A1070.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, currently the vice president of government relations and community affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will succeed Helene Grady, who announced this summer that she was leaving in October.
While Grady has a more traditional budget background, Weissmann brings a depth of relationships with the General Assembly to his new role, at a time when relations between the legislature and the Moore administration are strained.
In announcing the appointment Friday afternoon Moore called Weissmann “an experienced public servant and one of the most effective policy minds in our state.”
“His deep understanding of the Maryland budget, developed over years in both the legislative branch and in local government, makes him uniquely qualified to lead DBM,” Moore said in a prepared statement.
He went on to call the appointment “critical as we continue to execute on our budget priorities to make Maryland more affordable, competitive, and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”
At UMBC, Weissmann worked to strengthen relationships with policymakers and secure operating and capital funding, according to the governor’s office. It said he has also served as an assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, coordinating economic development and serving as the direct point of contact for several departments, including environmental protection, housing and community affairs, permitting services, and transportation.

“I am humbled and excited to serve under Governor Moore and to honor his administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, even during deeply challenging times,” Weissmann said in the statement released by the governor’s office.
“Working in collaboration with our partners in the Maryland General Assembly, we will ensure the steady management and administration of a balanced budget that delivers for all Marylanders,” his statement said.
Weissmann emerged as a late contender for the secretary’s job. The administration had considered a pool of other candidates including Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard); Deputy Treasurer Jonathan Martin; Rich Madaleno, a former Montgomery County senator who served as vice chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, and the current county administrative officer to Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich; and others.
News of Weissmann’s appointment came just two days after Deputy Budget Secretary Marc Nicole was named acting secretary on Wednesday. Nicole will assume that role on Oct. 15; Weissmann is slated to take over as secretary on Oct. 22.
Weissmann holds a bachelor’s degree in social work and psychology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He earned a master’s degree in social work from the University of Maryland School of Social Work and later a law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
He also currently serves on the Maryland State Board of Elections, a position he may have to give up as he assumes a job that determines the election agency’s budget.
Weissmann has a wealth of Annapolis experience, including three years as the top aide to two Senate leaders. After seven years as deputy chief of staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Weissmann took over as chief of staff. He remained in that position after Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) succeeded Miller. During his time as a senior adviser to Miller and Ferguson, he did help oversee legislative efforts on the budget.
Weissmann’s collegial demeanor and longstanding ties to the Senate, and by extension the General Assembly, could be an asset to Moore, who is entering the final legislative session of his first term.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore entered office riding a wave of excitement among legislative Democrats who had just finished eight years of partisan conflict with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. But the relationship between Moore and the legislature has shown signs of strain of late.
Moore’s public positions on issues such as ending automatic inflation-based increases to the gas tax and allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores rankled legislators in his own party. Recent vetoes by Moore, including one on a bill to study the issue of reparations, have drawn open criticism from Democratic lawmakers who are threatening override votes.
Legislative audits are also becoming more critical of Moore’s departments and becoming fodder for public hearings.
On budget issues, there have been frustrations between legislative budget committees and the administration over “miscalculations” including hundreds of millions in underestimated Medicaid costs.
Weissmann’s knowledge of the legislature and personal relationships with many of its leaders could be a balm for Moore’s frayed legislative relationships.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)It’s easy to watch Brad Pitt’s flyline unfurl in a perfect ‘S’ curve over the Gallatin River and know that image has helped feed into Montana’s status as an angling destination. 
It’s more difficult to determine exactly what kind of impact the fishing world has on the Treasure State. 
But that’s what the 2023 Legislature wanted to know when they requested Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks partner with the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research to estimate fishing’s economic contributions across the state. 
The report by the BBER, published in August, showed anglers contributed more than $910 million to Montana’s GDP in 2024 and supported more than $1.5 billion in total economic output — gross receipts to Montana businesses — across the state, making it one of biggest contributor’s to the state’s outdoor economic sector. 
“Fishing is deeply woven into the cultural and economic fabric of Montana,” the study authors wrote. “This study demonstrates that coldwater and warm-water fishing are not only popular recreational activities but also powerful economic drivers that support jobs, income, and business activity across the state.”
Researchers with BBER conducted their study by surveying a random sample of adults who purchased a Montana fishing license last year. The final dataset includes 1,181 completed responses — a roughly 30% response rate. Results were weighted using FWP license data as well as demographic benchmarks. 
The study splits anglers into warm-water fishing and cold-water fishing and analyzes trip-related expenditures among the more than 450,000 adults who purchased Montana fishing licenses in 2024. 
Data published by FWP show the department issued 180,328 individual resident fishing licenses and 261,734 individual nonresident licenses. 
More than 84,000 residents and 30,000 nonresidents also purchased combination licenses in 2024, which include fishing licenses, but the study focused exclusively on individual fishing licenses. 
Data shows that Montana’s fishing season is concentrated between June and October, though a clear bump in two-day license purchases shows the prevalence of ice fishing in the state.

The survey questions focused on trip-related expenditures including guiding services, equipment rentals, food, fuel and lodging, and modeled the corresponding impact to the local and statewide economy. 
A majority of the angling impact in Montana comes from cold-water fishing — for trout, salmon, grayling and whitefish — à la the classic “River Runs Through It” iconography. 
According to the study, these trips tended to be longer, involve more travel and generate higher spending on lodging, guides and dining. Cold-water fishing also weighted more heavily toward nonresidents, with 86% of nonresidents surveyed indicating they only engaged in cold-water fishing, compared to 52% of residents.

Warm-water anglers, by contrast, seek out fish such as walleye, northern pike, bass and sturgeon. These anglers were “overwhelmingly” Montana residents, fishing often and close to home with spending habits that reflected the nature of their trips — fuel and groceries dominated over guides or rentals. 
The average annual trip expenses for resident license holders was $1,897, compared to $3,923 for nonresidents. 
 Residents spend the most on fuel ($337), accommodations ($331) and retail ($284), while nonresidents overwhelmingly spent the most on accommodations ($1,490), outfitter and guiding fees ($704), and dining out ($436). 
In looking at the difference between the two types of fishing, cold-water fishing trips also correlated with significantly higher expenditures compared to warm-water fishing — roughly $4,900 compared to $380 annually. 
“This aligns with the finding that cold-water fishing more often involves travel and planning, while warm-water fishing more often involves shorter, local day trips,” according to the study.

In total for the 2024-2025 fishing season, anglers spent an estimated $1.29 billion on fishing-related goods and services. 
That spending supported an estimated 15,978 jobs, generated $427 million in personal income, and contributed nearly $1.5 billion in total economic output across the state. 
“Montana’s amazing angling opportunities are no secret, but this research shows just how important fishing is to communities and businesses around Montana,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in a statement.
The ripple effects of the angling economy is similarly distributed between the cold-water and warm-water fishing split. 
Among jobs supported by the fishing industry, 14,355 are tied to cold water fishing, while just over 1,600 are tied to warm-water fishing. 
“Though smaller in overall scale relative to cold-water fishing, warm-water fishing still represents an important source of in-state tourism and local spending — particularly for the anglers and businesses surrounding warm-water fisheries,” the study states. 
While researchers note the methodology of the study means that estimates are likely on the conservative side, it shows the broad importance of angling for Montana and highlights the importance of FWP to manage fisheries and waterways. 
“The impact of angler spending extends well beyond the state’s lakes and rivers,” the study concludes. “Whether through the wages paid to workers, the profits earned by local businesses, or the taxes collected by governments, the dollars spent by anglers flow throughout Montana’s economy.”
Here are a few additional highlights from the economic impact of Montana anglers:

450,000+ Individual Montana fishing licenses purchased by residents and nonresidents. 


33.6% of license holders reported not fishing once during the license year. 


41% of Montana residents who purchased a fishing license did not fish last year.

A particular concern for administrators is a new requirement that demands Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice per year. A similar requirement implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Health care providers eye collaboration as federal cuts loom.","Lamoille County Mental Health Services in Morristown. Photo via Facebook
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 9, 2025.
Area health care providers specializing in treatment for mental health-related issues and substance-use disorders are collaborating to better serve their shared patients, even as looming cuts to public insurance threaten to make treatment more challenging.
Lamoille County Mental Health Services CEO Jennifer Stratton, who has been on the job for about 18 months, said working with other health care providers like Lamoille Health Partners and Copley Hospital — as well as area law enforcement agencies — has been a main priority.
Both Lamoille Health Partners and Lamoille County Mental Health Services serve patients with overlapping health issues. Stratton said she often meets with health partners CEO Susan Bartlett, as many patients have what she calls co-occurring needs, which refers to their intersecting medical problems like substance-use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Lamoille County doesn’t have the “situation table” setups being explored in other Vermont towns — formal protocols for involving various health care, social support and police organizations when dealing with cases where various issues intersect. Instead, the Lamoille Health Collaborative, founded by Lamoille Health Partners to address the increasingly overlapping health issues faced in the early pandemic period, allows organizations to coordinate. 
Lamoille County Mental Health Services fields an around-the-clock crisis response team that responds, alongside police, to mental health emergencies. Many of them occur at Copley Hospital, leading Stratton to work closely with CEO Joe Woodin to coordinate resources.
Between the local Lamoille Health Collaborative, and the Woodin-led New England Health Collaborative — which includes other Vermont hospitals, the Lamoille Health Partners and other organizations — health care providers in Lamoille County have never been so strategically aligned, their executives say.
In one small example of how the health collaborative members look out for one another, the Lamoille Health Partners sold Lamoille County Mental Health Services some equipment for new sensory room equipment.
It may soon be more necessary than ever. 
Last year, Lamoille Health Partners laid off its former director and sold off its two Washington Highway offices to Copley Hospital to stem a financial crisis. 
And looming cuts to Medicaid, passed in the so-called “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” in July by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump, would eliminate about $1 trillion in funding over 10 years for the federal program that provides insurance to low-income and disabled people, and children. Those cuts would particularly threaten funding for rural health care providers.
“At Lamoille County Mental Health Services — and I’m sure I’m speaking collectively for all of the individuals who are part of the Lamoille Health Collaborative, because we all work really well together — we want to meet the needs of our community and the individuals,” Stratton said. “If we’re not receiving the funding to do so, we can’t. Most of us are so dependent on Medicaid that it makes it difficult, financially, to be able to continue to provide those services without individuals receiving that funding.”
Bracing for impact
Stratton worries not just about a larger number of uninsured patients but also about the new work requirement provisions included in the bill that demand Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice a year. A health policy research report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a similar program implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
“Individuals are going to have to be reapplying for their Medicaid twice a year, and I am concerned that there’s going to be a lot of individuals that are going to be kicked off, at least temporarily, for their Medicaid,” Stratton said.
This potential change could mean even those who do continue to qualify for public insurance will face increased bureaucratic barriers and a higher likelihood of insurance interruptions. For patients juggling an interconnected suite of ailments across multiple doctors and specialists, even a brief interruption in insurance can delay necessary and potentially life-saving treatment.
Stratton has started an effort to get Lamoille County Mental Health Services staff trained as Medicaid assessors, which will allow them to have better access to patient’s insurance applications, and has urged her fellow health collaborative members to train their staff members as well.
Copley CEO Woodin echoed that sentiment.
“I think we’re always relearning that we need each other,” Woodin said. “Hospitals, primary care, specialists, home health agency, nursing home. We’re all sort of a team taking care of the same folks, so it’s important that we get along and support each other.”
On the front lines
The ongoing shutdown of the federal government stems from an effort by Democratic lawmakers, including Vermont’s federal delegation, to force Republicans to reverse planned cuts to Medicaid and public option insurance subsidies passed in their bill over the summer. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned the proposed cuts could “literally collapse the entire (health care) system.”
At the Johnson Health Center, directors Geoff and Caroline Butler are on the frontline of a system that is already badly frayed, providing primary care with a substance-use disorder focus in both Johnson and Burlington.
“The looming cuts are something that we think about every day over at the health center,” Geoff Butler said. “With the potential of thousands of Vermont owners losing their coverage, it’s a devastating thought.”
At the health center, patients are already being treated for their intersecting medical, mental health and addiction issues, and staff are already trained to assist patients with insurance paperwork, and they have an on-staff social worker. Butler said it’s the material issues — like access to housing, something that no doctor can address — that are the biggest barriers to care.
“I think one of the biggest things though we are seeing lately with mental health and substance-use issues is housing,” Butler said. “We work with the majority of the unhoused population in Burlington, and that housing piece, making sure people are housed through the winter, at least have a warm place to go for the night.”
In a recent policy report from the Vermont Department of Health laying out initiatives for the next five years, the first goal proposed is to “improve the availability of affordable, accessible, and safe housing.” The fourth goal proposed is to “strengthen the capacity of the mental health and substance use services system to support individuals and communities.”
There are already “no great options for inpatient mental health care in Vermont,” Butler said, and long waiting lists for those that are there. Lamoille County Mental Health Services has a handful of beds in Morrisville and Johnson, and a couple of beds dedicated to the needs of patients in crisis.
“The organizations doing that work are doing great work. It’s just so limited,” Butler said.

(Photo by Jay Waggmeester/Florida Phoenix)As the Florida Democratic Party continues to consider opening its primary elections to independent voters, a survey backed by proponents finds strong support for the idea.
Florida Open Primaries, an advocacy group working to open Florida’s closed primary voting system, along with the group Open Primaries and its Let Us Vote campaign, says that of the 626 Florida Democrats surveyed, 87% support having the party unilaterally open its primary election to nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voters. Among the 684 NPA voters surveyed, 80% support the proposal.
Florida is a closed primary election state. That means only registered voters from the Republican and Democratic parties can participate in partisan primary elections.  Election observers nationally disagree about how many states are truly “closed” primaries. Ballotpedia says 13 states require closed primaries. The National Conference of State Legislatures puts the number at nine.
Whatever, the survey found that 96% of NPA voters in Florida and 93% of Florida Democratic voters support open primaries.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said earlier this year that she and her staff were collecting information about an open primary to present to party members. The Phoenix reported in July that the proposal was controversial among some Democrats, who feared it would divide a party that hasn’t seen a member of its ranks win a statewide race since 2018.
Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president of Open Primaries, says that the organization conducted the survey of 1,310 Florida voters by itself, without assistance from an outside firm.
The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo via Google Earth)Attorneys for Summit Carbon Solutions argued Friday in Polk County District Court that the company’s proposed amendment to its permit for a carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa should be decided on before a legal case against the permit can move forward. 
The Iowa Utilities Commission approved a permit in June 2024 for Summit Carbon Solutions to build more than 600 miles of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Iowa, with the condition that the company gain permits in the Dakotas before beginning construction. 
The Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, along with several counties and individual landowners, then filed a lawsuit in fall 2024, seeking to overturn the IUC’s permit approval. The lawsuit alleged the proceedings were unfair and that Summit did not meet the definition of a common carrier.

Summit filed a petition with the IUC on Sept. 15 to amend its approved permit. The amendment would remove the condition that required approval in the Dakotas and add several route and pipe-size modifications to the permit. This action followed Summit’s second permit denial in South Dakota and the enactment of a law barring the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines in the state.

Summit also requested the court remand the Sierra Club and landowners’ case to the IUC and stay any future actions on the case until the IUC decided on the filed amendment petition. This was the issue before Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie Friday morning. 
Summit’s attorney, Bret Dublinske of Fredrickson & Byron in Des Moines, argued the IUC needed to rule on the amendment petition before the case against the permit could proceed. 
He argued the facts in the case would be outdated once the IUC ruled on the amendment and the courts would be presented with either duplicative litigation or a scenario in which the ruling did not match the most recent version of the permit. 
“It makes little sense to proceed to litigate over outdated facts that are in the process of being amended, and would be contrary to judicial economy to split the Summit 1.0 case in such a way that it may be litigated twice – once for the original permit and once for the decision on the Petition to Amend that permit,” Summit wrote in its request to remand the case. 
Wally Taylor, on behalf of the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, argued Summit did not supply sufficient information as to how the amendment would change the nature of the lawsuit against the IUC’s decision.
“The proposed amendment does not impact any of the issues in this decision,” Taylor argued. “… It does not change the lack of public convenience and necessity, the issue of eminent domain, the damage to farmland … none of the petitioners have raised issues about the route or even impact of the condition on the South Dakota permit.” 
Taylor asked the court to deny the motion to remand the case to the IUC. 
Brian Jorde with Domina Law Group, based in Nebraska, represented landowners in the case and took a similar stance to Taylor, arguing it would make more sense for the case to continue without regard to Summit’s amendment with the IUC, so that the Iowa Supreme Court can give guidance on the carbon pipeline issue.
Jorde said the landowners and affected parties in the case “don’t need to go through eight more weeks of hearings” in the multi-year case for the same “mistakes” to be made by the IUC on the amendment.

“We need guidance from the Supreme Court; frankly, the IUC needs guidance from the Supreme Court,” Jorde said. “Is a carbon dioxide pipeline that you know has no drop off points in the state of Iowa,  does that promote public convenience and necessity? We need the Supreme Court to tell us, or we’re just going to have 15, potentially, other dockets fighting that same issue.” 
Michelle Rabe, on behalf of the Iowa Utilities Commission, said while the IUC believes Summit’s request for remand is, “slightly outside” of how a remand is typically used, she believes there are three options forward, “none of which are ideal.”
Rabe said Beattie could deny the remand and allow the case to continue, in which case it would advance through the courts until eventually the Supreme Court issues what she said could be a “moot order” at that point because the permit might have changed via the IUC proceedings. 
The second option she presented was for the court to grant the remand and allow the IUC to rule on the amendment, in which case she predicted the parties would appeal the IUC’s decision and then the courts would be presented with potentially “parallel” cases. 
The third option, she said, would be for the court to stay the decision and allow the IUC proceedings to play out, so that when that decision is appealed, the two cases can be consolidated. 
“I don’t think there’s a clean way to do it at this point,” Rabe said. “I think what Summit is asking … on the amendment, may not directly affect the bigger issues in the case. I think potentially it could, but we don’t know.” 
Summit to change routes?
Summit’s amendment petition with the IUC, per Dublinske and the filing, does not seek to do away with the IUC’s protections against a “pipeline to nowhere.” Instead of listing North Dakota as the ending point, Summit asks the permit be changed to instead condition pipeline construction to the company’s securement of “access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.”
Dublinske said the changes that occurred in South Dakota since the permit was issued, along with carbon sequestration site potential in Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas, are “fundamentally the reasons” the company submitted the amendment and requested the remand in the case. 
Opponents suggested the amendment means that Summit plans to change its original route, which would have ended in North Dakota where the CO2 could be pumped into an underground rock formation. 
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the amendment “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota.” 
“Our focus is on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” the spokesperson said.
Beattie said he will work to issue an order as soon as possible, though he suspected it would be a “couple of weeks” before he able to issue a written order.

Although the prosecution planned to reference the text messages on Friday as part of its examination of Ben Cotton – one of the IT specialists who allegedly examined voting machines from Barry, Missaukee and Roscommon counties – DePerno’s attorney, Michael Cronkright, objected, arguing the text messages were privileged work products tied to Deperno’s case seeking a “forensic audit” of election results in Antrim County. 
A human error in reporting unofficial 2020 election returns in Antrim County briefly showed former President Joe Biden had won the GOP stronghold. While the results were later corrected, the error sparked conspiracy theories in line with President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. 
According to a report from the Detroit News, the text messages at issue were initially raised during preliminary examination on Thursday. The messages stemmed from a group called “Michigan forensics” where DePerno exchanged messages with cybersecurity specialists about unproven theories that technological issues contributed to President Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. 
DePerno’s Antrim County case was dismissed by the 13th Circuit Court in May of 2021 and was subsequently rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court.
After a bench conference with Hilson and his assistant prosecutor Heather Bloomquist, as well as Cronkright and Rendon’s attorney Camilla Barkovic, Meinecke postponed further examination until both parties are able to file a motion on whether the text messages should be permitted. The court will hear the motions on Nov. 21. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hilson called the decision to delay further examination “an unfortunate glitch in the proceedings.”
“Certainly we feel very confident about the evidence that we want to introduce, and I understand the due process aspect of it, and we’re just going to go through that and hopefully the judge sees it our way,” Hilson told reporters. “Ultimately, if he doesn’t, we’re still going to move forward, because I still think that our witnesses helped carry this case.”
According to Hilson, the text messages originated from Cotton’s cell phone.
While speaking with reporters, Deperno maintained that the messages were a work product from the Antrim County case, where Cotton had served as an expert witness. He said Cotton had been threatened with prosecution if he did not turn over the messages. 
“They’re clearly work product and attorney client privilege and only Bill Bailey can waive that privilege,” DePerno said. 
Bailey, DePerno’s client in the Antrim County case, died in 2024.
While DePerno has filed campaign finance paperwork to run for Michigan attorney general in 2026, he would not confirm to reporters whether he was once again seeking the position. 
“I’m not saying I am and I’m not saying I’m not,” he said. 
The preliminary examination is tentatively scheduled to continue on December 18 and 19.

(Getty Images)West Virginia pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots without prescriptions, according to guidance issued Oct. 6 by the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy.
Earlier in the season, prescriptions were required because of a state law that requires pharmacists to have a valid prescription for a vaccine they administer unless the shots are on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of recommended vaccines.
The CDC panel met Sept. 19. On Oct. 6, the agency officially adopted the panel’s recommendations that vaccinating everyone aged six months and up be determined by individual decision-making.
Some pharmacies, including Walgreens locations in the state, have been administering the vaccines with no prescription for longer. A Walgreen’s spokeswoman said the pharmacy began offering the shot with no prescription on Sept. 12. 
According to the state Board of Pharmacy: People over age 65 years and those with conditions that put them at increased risk for severe COVID-19 benefit the most from vaccination. Those conditions can include cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes and other health conditions. 
In the state of West Virginia’s guidance to public health partners, it notes that the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, including pregnant women, and for children ages 6 to 23 months. People aged 2 through 18 should get a COVID-19 shot if they’re at increased risk of severe COVID, the agency recommends. 
State guidance also notes that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children 6-23 months old and all children who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 receive a vaccine. AAP also recommends vaccinating children who live in long-term care facilities and those who live with people at high risk for severe COVID-19.

Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday afternoon that he’s creating a new court in Chittenden County that will address the county’s backlog in legal cases by trying repeat offenders. 
The new court, called The Community Accountability Court, is part of Scott’s “response to increased concerns about quality of life crimes and disorder in Burlington,” according to a press release from his office. 
The initiative comes about a month after Scott declared he had a plan to address public safety concerns, many related to drug use, in the Queen City. Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak previously claimed that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the city combat persistent social and economic challenges.

The new court will target additional resources for three to four months toward trying repeat offenders who have many pending legal cases against them, the press release said. It’s part of a multi-step plan Scott plans to roll out in the coming days. 
“These additional resources for the Chittenden County Superior Court will help alleviate the backlog, ensure people receive a trial, and provide the kind of immediate follow up that is necessary for (Burlington Police Department)’s enforcement activities to be most effective,” Mulvaney-Stanak said in the governor’s release. 
She and Scott are discussing immediate solutions, like the new court, as well as long-term strategies, Mulvaney-Stanak said in the release. 
Chittenden County Criminal Court, from July through September of this year, has seen a large uptick in criminal cases, Defender General Matt Valerio told a legislative committee Thursday. Public defenders in the county are handling a 37% increase in criminal cases compared to the same quarter of last year, he said. 
That’s a big issue because 39% of total legal cases in the state come from Chittenden County, Valerio said. So when that county’s courts are backed up, it has a really outsized impact on the state, he said. 
In Vermont criminal court, public defenders represent over 90% of people accused, Valerio said in an interview. That makes their caseload pretty representative of how many cases the courts are handling more broadly. 
A dedicated judge will be appointed by the judiciary to oversee the new court, and Scott will select a prosecutor to handle the cases litigated within it, the release said. 
This story will be updated.

Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls. “Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise […]","Voting at the Portland Expo on Tuesday was steady and smooth, said poll workers. (Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls.
“Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise that important freedom. Reject Question 1 at the ballot box on November 4th.”
The campaign for this referendum question was launched in April 2024 by the Dinner Table PAC as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at polling places. The submitted proposal also seeks to modify a variety of election laws including absentee voting, according to the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January. 
Though there was pushback on the wording from the campaign and its proponents, Maine’s highest court gave it the OK in mid-July. 
Mills argued that the changes proposed in Question 1 would make it harder for seniors, people with disabilities, rural residents, first responders and workers with unpredictable schedules to vote by banning pre-paid return postage for absentee ballots and prohibiting voters from requesting absentee ballots by phone or through family members.
The proposal also seeks to repeal the current provision in statute allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other. It also wants to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle. This option was implemented last February for voters over the age of 65 who self-identify as having a disability.
Additionally, the petition would remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes, instead requiring them to only have one. 
The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it is up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. Challenged voters may still cast a ballot, but it is marked as being challenged so that it can be reviewed in the event of a close race.
“Whether you vote in person or by absentee ballot, you can trust that your vote will be counted fairly,” Mills said. “But that fundamental right to vote is under attack from Question 1.”
The democratic governor, who is poised to announce a run for U.S. Senate to challenge Republican Susan Collins, has also come out against Question 2 on the November ballot, which seeks to implement a red flag law.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A white banner spanning the width of the Chartercare Foundation’s website declares its independence from the similarly named Chartercare Health Partners.
“To our Supporters and Clients: The recent notification of bankruptcy for Chartercare Health Partners does not apply to the Foundation,” the notice reads. “We are a separate and distinct 501(3) community foundation and have been since our inception in 2014.”
And yet, the prospective buyer for Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence, is looking to the charitable foundation to help finance the purchase of the struggling hospitals that the nonprofit was created to support, as first reported by The Providence Journal.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, confirmed the Atlanta nonprofit wants a “return” of donations meant to help the hospitals before they parted ways with the foundation in 2014. 
“As the original donors intended, these funds would be dedicated to supporting the mission and work of the hospitals, to support access to programs and services for our most vulnerable patients, many of whom are [on] Medicaid and Medicare,” Brown said in an email Friday. “The hospitals continue to provide a significant amount of uncompensated care, which these funds would also support. Consistent with our new 501c3 status, we would also be concentrating resources on our community health needs assessment and priority areas, consistent with state health equity initiatives.”
Brown did not specify the amount of money CharterCare Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, wants from the foundation. However, Brown noted the foundation’s sizable assets — $6.8 billion as of September 2024, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Since the split in 2014, Roger Williams and Fatima have struggled to stay afloat under the financial and operational mismanagement of its now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings. Meanwhile, the foundation — which has an office in North Providence two miles west of Fatima hospital — has carved out a niche in local health care grants and student scholarships while paying the six-figure salary of its executive director, Paula Iacono, according to tax filings. Iacono, the only paid employee, with a $101,616 salary in fiscal 2023, declined to comment when reached by email Friday.
Like the foundation, Iacono used to be connected to the hospitals directly, helping raise money for their operations and related primary care and specialty clinics, according to news reports.
That changed in 2014, when Prospect bought Roger Williams and Fatima, turning them from nonprofit to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable contributions. The foundation split off as its own organization, and Iacono followed.
The pending sale to The Centurion Foundation, if finalized, returns the hospitals to nonprofit ownership — making them eligible to take back the donations made on its behalf through the foundation years ago.
“We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes,” Brown said in an email.
Support from lawmakers
Centurion has enlisted heavy hitters on Smith Hill to back up its request.
“These hospitals are critical community assets which need to be preserved, employing roughly 2,400 people and providing essential community hospital services to thousands of Rhode Islanders, including over 50,000 emergency room visits last year alone,” reads the Oct. 3 email signed by Senate President Valarie Lawson, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 75 other members of the Rhode Island General Assembly.
The email, addressed to Patricia Wegrzyn McGreen, president of the foundation’s board of directors, urges the foundation to consider returning some of the donations received when it was still linked to Roger Williams and Fatima hospitals to help Centurion close the deal.










We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes.


– Otis Brown, spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation


Brown said Gov. Dan McKee and local physicians have also “fully supported” its request. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday afternoon.
Not named among the supporters: Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who has played a key role in reviewing and setting conditions on the pending sale.
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said they were “not in a position to comment at this time,” in an email Friday.
Since granting conditional approval for the sale in June 2024, the state’s top prosecutor has kept close watch on the transaction, agreeing to four rounds of revisions to aid Centurion in financing the deal.
Finding investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds — lowered from a $165 million value earlier this year — has proven difficult. Centurion executives blamed the challenge on the financial conditions imposed by state regulators, which include an upfront cash injection into the hospitals’ balance sheet. But credit ratings agencies may have also spooked investors, noting the “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year. Meanwhile, federal spending cuts are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks. 
But without the bonds — or an alternative source of funding, such as decade-old donations — the sale appears at risk of failure, in turn putting the hospitals in jeopardy. 
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Neronha has repeatedly warned of the cascading consequences if either or both hospitals close, a concern echoed by state lawmakers in their letter to the foundation.
“We are deeply concerned that the closure of these hospitals would cause a significant loss of access to emergency room care, primary care, cancer treatment, behavioral health and substance abuse treatment services to thousands of Rhode Islanders that we represent, many of whom are ill-equipped to find other hospital-based services,” the letter states. “These hospitals are vital safety-net health care facilities, with a large majority of their patients being covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Significant impacts would also be felt by other hospitals in the region and the delivery of emergency services in communities around the state.”
Neronha said in an interview on WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers Friday that he expects the bond sale to close by the end of the month.

Biden’s Energy-Efficient Home Credit to End in 2025 After Big Beautiful Bill, Time Running Out to Save $2000.  
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware homeowners planning to upgrade their homes with new insulation, energy-efficient windows, or heat pumps will need to act fast. A federal tax credit that helps offset the cost of energy-saving improvements is ending much sooner than expected.
The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, originally allowed homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of certain energy-efficient upgrades made through 2032. But under the new One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, that timeline has been sharply cut short.
Early Sunset, Big Impact
The credit will now expire after December 31, 2025, reducing the available window for improvements from ten years to just three. Qualifying upgrades must be installed and in service by the end of 2025 to count.
The program provides annual credits of up to $1,200 for improvements like doors, windows, insulation, and home energy audits, and up to $2,000 for high-efficiency systems such as heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves or boilers.
“The early sunset means homeowners who were spacing out upgrades over several years will need to accelerate plans,” said Ben Boyce Sr., owner of Aire Serv Heating and Air. “We’re already hearing from homeowners who are electing to try to squeeze in an upgrade before the deadline.”
No Carryover or Refunds
The credit remains nonrefundable—it can reduce a taxpayer’s bill but cannot produce a refund. Unlike before, unused credits can no longer be carried forward to future tax years.
In another change, beginning in 2025, only equipment from qualified manufacturers with a product ID number listed on the tax return will be eligible.
The related Residential Clean Energy Credit, which covered solar panels and battery storage, was also cut short and will now end after 2025, instead of 2032.
Delaware Families May Feel the Pinch
For Delaware and Brandywine Valley families, the shortened timeline could pose challenges. Many households planned to take advantage of both federal and local incentives, such as Delmarva Power’s energy efficiency rebates, to make upgrades affordable over time.
“This was a well-designed, bipartisan incentive that encouraged smart energy investments,” said Evans. “Cutting it short removes an important tool for families trying to lower energy bills and improve their homes responsibly.”
Homeowners can still claim the credit for qualifying projects completed in 2023, 2024, or 2025 using IRS Form 5695.

Cecil Brockman (Photo: ncleg.net)A judge has set bond at $1,050,000 for Rep. Cecil Brockman during a Friday court appearance after he was charged with multiple sex crimes against a minor.
Brockman, a 41-year-old Democrat who represents Guilford County, appeared over video call from a hospital room during his first court hearing. He was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of a 15-year-old victim, according to a Guilford County magistrate’s order.
Initially set to appear at the Guilford County Courthouse in Greensboro on Thursday, Brockman’s hearing was postponed until Friday after he was hospitalized due to a medical emergency. Court staff informed reporters late Friday morning that the hearing would be moved from 2 p.m. to 11:30 a.m.
Brockman wore a hospital gown and appeared to have a patch on his chest during the video call, the News and Observer reported.
Greensboro attorney Alec Carpenter represented the lawmaker. He told the court Brockman is waiving his indigency claim. Carpenter did not immediately return a call Friday afternoon.
Judge Gordon Miller said the maximum sentence Brockman faced was life in prison without parole, according to the News and Observer.
Miller ordered Brockman not to have contact with the victim and to remain in the state of North Carolina, WFMY reported. If Brockman makes bail, he must wear an ankle monitor.
During Friday’s hearing, Guilford County District Attorney Avery Crump said Brockman met the minor on an online dating app near Atlanta in May. He lived with the teen there, and the two moved to an apartment in High Point in August.
The victim turned 15 in June.
Prosecutors said Brockman tried to track the victim through Life360 on Sunday, sending an Uber to the minor’s location, according to WFMY. After the driver was unable to find the victim, Brockman directed 911 to the location in Davidson County.
Law enforcement contacted the High Point Police Department, who in turn reached out to the State Bureau of Investigation, FOX8 News reported.
Brockman reportedly made attempts to gain access to the victim while the minor was in a local hospital on Wednesday, including attempting to enter a locked room, reports said.
The victim’s phone contained 14 videos, some of which allowed officials to identify Brockman, multiple outlets reported.
Brockman’s next court date is scheduled for Nov. 13.
Following the news of Brockman’s arrest and the charges, several lawmakers — including Gov. Josh Stein, former governor and 2026 U.S. Senate candidate Roy Cooper, and state leadership from both parties — called for the five-term lawmaker to immediately resign.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Sales of Minnesota products to foreign countries fell by 19% over the past year, according to data released Friday by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. 
The steep decline was driven by a falloff in sales to Minnesota’s three top trading partners: Mexico, China and Canada. American consumers and companies are paying 25% to 35% taxes on imports from those countries, and President Donald Trump threatened again Friday to hike taxes on Chinese goods even higher. 
Minnesota has been hit harder than the nation as a whole: U.S. exports overall were up 6% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. 
Exports to Canada — the largest buyer of Minnesota goods — have dropped by 45% in one year. Mineral oil and fuel exports to Canada accounted for more than half of the overall decline in exports, according to DEED. Canada imported 96% less oil from Minnesota last quarter than in the second quarter of 2024.
“Minnesota’s export statistics were particularly sensitive to changes in the oil market this quarter, but overall declines to our biggest export markets illustrate the risk of tariff uncertainty to our economy,” DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek said in a press release.
Excluding mineral oil and fuel, exports of other goods fell by 10%, with machinery, vehicles, optic and medical equipment and some construction materials seeing the steepest drops. International sales of electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, dairy, eggs and honey all increased. 
Minnesota soybean producers are particularly concerned because their largest buyer, China, has not purchased American soybeans since May. (Argentina is filling the gap in the market while receiving financial assistance from the U.S. to stabilize its economy.) Meat exports to China from Minnesota have dropped 45% over the past year.

The Essex town planning commission denied a zoning request from the state that would have advanced plans to build a new women’s prison. 
The decision, the latest roadblock in state attempts to build new secure facilities for adults and juveniles, may force officials back to the drawing board as they evaluate how to address ongoing challenges with Vermont’s existing women’s prison, which is overcrowded and in need of significant repairs.
“I’m not against the concept of a prison,” Joshua Knox, the commission’s chair, said at the Thursday night meeting before the vote. But he and other members felt the state was unable to make key promises, such as ensuring public transportation near the potential facility. “I want that to be locked in and decided,” he said. 
All commission members casting a vote rejected moving forward with the state’s zoning request.
The vote may end a 14-month process during which the Department of Corrections and Department of Buildings and General Services considered two state-owned properties in Essex as possible sites for a new women’s correctional and reentry facility.

Women incarcerated in Vermont are currently detained at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington. But the facility, built in the 1970s, suffers from faltering infrastructure, issues that women held there have said they want addressed. In recent weeks, the prison has hit capacity, with some units holding more women than they were designed to. 
Irene Wrenner, an Essex town resident and a former state senator, spoke at Thursday’s meeting about the importance of constructing a more dignified prison. 
“The showers reeked of human waste and were infested with sewer flies, maggots and mold,” she told the planning commission, describing the South Burlington prison. 
While Essex residents who participated in recent public meetings about a possible new prison have been split on their views, most have opposed building a new facility in Essex.
Haley Sommer, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the state was still evaluating the planning commission’s decision and what it means for future plans for a new women’s prison.

New Mexico lobbyists have continued spending at the highest level in at least five years, according to the latest state filings, shelling out more than $230,000 to wine and dine lawmakers, along with other expenditures, over the last few months. 
In total, 140 lobbyists reported $234,000 in expenditures between May and October, including paying for mailers, catering legislative meetings or holding events.
Lobbyists were required Oct. 8 to report their last few months of expenditures and political contributions.
The recent expenditures bring the total spent so far this year to a little over $1.26 million, which is already the most spent since at least 2021, even with two months left in the year. Lobbyists have spent, on average, about $750,000 annually the last four years.
The biggest spender in the latest reporting period, University of New Mexico lobbyist Mike Puelle, reported spending about $38,000 between May and October, including approximately $20,000 alone for a single event: the late September “1st Annual Rivalry Weekend” football game between UNM and New Mexico State University. 
According to Puelle’s filings, he invited state lawmakers, along with the other local and state officials and staff from both universities.

Most of his other expenditures covered catering meetings of interim legislative committees, including ones discussing radioactive and hazardous materials, health care, economic development and more. 
Puelle did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday about his spending on behalf of the state’s biggest university. He is one of seven UNM lobbyists, according to Secretary of State filings.
While state law requires lobbyists to periodically report their spending, it does not require them to tell the public which bills they’re lobbying for or against.
The Legislature earlier this year passed House Bill 143, which would have required lobbyists to specify the legislation they hoped to influence, as well as their employers’ positions on specific bills. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed it, saying that while she supported the bill’s intent, it would impose “an onerous requirement” on lobbyists and their employers and that some of its provisions were unclear.
Recent ProPublica reporting tied the New Mexico governor’s veto to nationwide rollbacks of state-level transparency and ethics legislation. 
While state law does not require lobbyists to specify bill numbers, the second-biggest spender in the most recent reporting period did so voluntarily.
Sarah Hetemi, reported more than $32,000 in spending as a lobbyist for Americans For Prosperity, a conservative think tank founded by the billionaire Koch brothers.
All Hetemi’s spending, according to her filings, related to House Bill 11, the Paid Family and Medical Leave bill. She reported spending money on mailers thanking lawmakers for opposing the bill or criticizing those who supported it. The bill did not pass the Senate.
The biggest spender this year so far is Missi Currier, CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. According to her latest spending report, she’s reported more than $360,000 in various expenditures.
Lobbyists this week were also required to report their political contributions to candidates or political action committees between May and October. 
The biggest contributions came from lobbyists for oil and gas companies, including $155,750 that Chevron lobbyist Patrick Killen reported spending in the last few months. His filings report a $50,000 donation to the Our Values PAC, a conservative political action committee based in Roswell, as well as $31,000 to the Speaker Fund, the New Mexico House Democrats’ PAC. 
He also reported 12 donations of $6,200 each — the maximum allowable under state law — to elected Democratic and Republican state lawmakers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana leaders on Friday met with Vice President JD Vance for the third time as they work to secure support for mid-cycle, partisan redistricting. They remained tight-lipped about the meeting’s contents as protesters rallied in opposition. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, called it a “productive” and “fruitful” discussion. He said his caucus hadn’t yet made a choice, but hinted an answer to the redistricting question could come soon. 
“Obviously, the conversation was about redistricting,” he told reporters. “We talked a lot about that — pros and cons — and so, no decisions were made. But we’re going to work on that and hopefully have a decision very soon.”

President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census. 
Indiana’s current map, drawn in 2021, is 7-2 Republicans. Democrats hold seats in northwest and central Indiana
House Speaker Todd Huston declined to talk to reporters but released a statement thanking Vance “for again talking with our caucus members and facilitating an open dialogue on this important topic. It means a lot to us that he is willing to spend time in our state, personally communicating with and answering questions from Hoosier lawmakers. We had another productive conversation today and we’ll keep discussing this within our caucus and with the Hoosiers we represent as we come to a decision soon.”
Upon leaving the Statehouse, Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, shared that he was fully in support of new maps, regardless of consequences or constituent opposition. 
“I would rather be courageous and take a stand and do something that I know a fair amount of voters are going to say, ‘You know what? We’re not going to vote for you.’ I would rather lose my seat than my grandkids lose their country,” he said.
Gaskill said he doesn’t feel pressure from higher-ups. He knew the debate was coming when Texas and California moved to change their maps.
“We ought to do our part … if one side’s fighting the other side can’t be doing ‘rock paper scissors,'” Gaskill said. “You’re going to get run over.”

When asked about the Senate Republican caucus’ delay, Bray said his members like to be “thoughtful and contemplative and understand the issue very well” before coming to a decision. 
He declined to share meeting specifics and didn’t say whether there were enough votes to support new maps. 
“We’ve been working on this for a while, so we’d like to come to a resolution fairly shortly,” he concluded.
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, offered a more blunt analysis. 
“They don’t have the votes, currently,” she said during a joint news conference with House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta.
“There’s something happening here because (otherwise) the vice president wouldn’t have to come here — twice now — in order to twist some arms,” said GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne.

Protesters bring props to VP’s visit
The Democratic leaders spoke following another energetic rally at the Indiana Statehouse.
Protesters lined the dual marble staircases and filled the space in between, raising anti-redistricting signs and following speakers’ chants. One protester — in drag as Trump — puppeteered drag versions of Vance and Braun, who writhed upon the marble floors.
Some assembled earlier at the library, jeering as Vance’s motorcade rolled in. Law enforcement officers urged them away from the security perimeter.
Other protesters arrived even sooner. 
A quartet of Hoosiers set up a reclining couch early Friday morning on the sidewalk in front of the Indiana Statehouse as a “gift” to the vice president, who was subject to a false claim involving couches based on a passage from his memoir.
Indiana resident Cassie Jackson said she hoped the prop would stop Vance from pressuring state lawmakers further on the topic of redistricting.
“You can have the couch as a gift,” Jackson said. “But please, don’t come back.” 
She said the group transported the couch on a car roof and set it up before lawmakers arrived. The group recounted how one Republican senator, on his way in, privately told them that he wouldn’t be voting in favor of new maps. 
Jackson’s friend was unconvinced, saying, “These guys lie to us all the time.”

“They’re here to be persuaded so they can go back to their constituents and say, ‘Oh, we were going to say we’re Indiana boys and we’re tough. But then JD came in and he told us what’s what,’” Charlie Spears said. “… I can’t believe a guy from Ohio is going to come in here and tell Indiana how to vote.”
It was Vance’s second trip to Indiana in about two months, as the map-drawing push stalled. 
At least two Hoosier congressmen joined: U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, who flew with Vance on Air Force Two, and 3rd District Rep. Marlin Stutzman. 
Vance also met with Braun, who thanked the vice president for taking the time to visit Indiana in a statement posted to X.
“I appreciated the thoughtful discussion about how our state is serving Hoosiers through common-sense and strong leadership,” he wrote. “We discussed redistricting and the importance of ensuring fair representation for every Hoosier. I look forward to continuing our partnership to keep Indiana — and America — moving in the right direction.”
The meeting was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at the nearby Indiana State Library. Lawmakers began streaming into the underground tunnels of the government campus center — and underwent security scans by Secret Service agents — just after 9 a.m.

Members of the Braun administration exited the tunnels at 11 a.m. Indiana Senate Republicans began filtering out from their gathering at 12:20, while the House GOP caucus left at 1:40 p.m.
Some exiting lawmakers were enthusiastic about the visit, including Rep. Ryan Lauer, R-Columbus, who extolled Vance’s virtues and called him an “absolutely wonderful family man.”
The vice president last visited Indiana in August to meet with Braun, Bray and Huston and rally support for early redistricting. Neither the governor nor legislative leadership signaled any firm commitment to the proposal at the time.
Later that month, dozens of GOP lawmakers from Indiana’s House and Senate traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about a variety of topics, including redistricting. Bray and Huston met in person with Trump during that visit.
Braun has since repeatedly floated the idea of a November special session for early redistricting. The next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January, around the same time that Indiana’s window to file congressional bids opens.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one this week — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (9-1-4, 2-1-2 CUSA) earned their first home Conference USA victory defeating Jacksonville State, 2-0.
 
NEWARK— Amid a black night sky Freshman goalkeeper Sophia Hall was bound to stand out in her vibrant pink kit. Instead, it was her play in goal that caught the attention of the Delaware crowd at Stuart and Suzanne Grant Stadium Thursday night.
The Blue Hens led Jacksonville State by a goal with a little more than 20 minutes remaining in the game. The Gamecocks set up for their fifth corner of the match and booted it to the top of the box. Gamecock defenseman Reina Herndon got a running start on her touch and fired a powerful blast to the top left of the net. Hall leaped and dove through the air to meet the ball stretching her arms all the way out to deflect the ball away from harm.  
The tipped ball hit off the top of the post and bounced back into play. Hall got to her feet quickly to prepare for another game saving play, but her teammates had her back. The UD defense blocked a few Jacksonville State kicks before they could reach the Pennsylvania native in net, helping lead UD to a 2-0 victory against Jacksonville State.
Hall has made an immediate impact for the Blue Hen’s defense 14 games into her blossoming career. In her first season as a Blue Hen, Hall has 54 saves (third in CUSA) and a save percentage of .831 (second in CUSA). She’s been in goal for every minute of every game and recorded her sixth shutout putting her in a three-way tie for sixth in program history for shutouts in a single season.
Hall’s defensive performance was the catalyst for UD’s second goal of the evening. Following the defensive stand, the Blue Hens pushed on the counterattack moving the ball through the left side of the midfield to the right side in their offensive zone. 
The ball reached the foot of sophomore Brooke Vogel with one defender blocking her way. Vogel blew past the defender, set up her shot with the goalie bearing down on her and rocketed the ball to the back left corner of the net. 
Vogel’s third goal of the season provided the Blue Hens a comfortable cushion with about 17 minutes remaining in the game. Fellow sophomore Gabby Riley started the scoring with her second goal of the season in the early minutes of the second half. Riley’s goal came off a corner kick that managed to evade a touch by either team, sneaking through the mass of players into the back left of the net.
The Gamecocks’ led the game with 17 shots — six on target — but UD’s defense was stout, keeping the Gamecocks off the scoreboard. The Gamecocks are winless in conference play this season and hold an overall record of 6-6-3. They’re currently 11th in the conference standings, two spots away from making the conference tournament.  
UD’s win was its first home win against a CUSA opponent in program history. It was also head coach Kelly Lawrence’s 20th win at UD.  
The Blue Hens remain at home for two more games against Kennesaw State and the leader in the CUSA standings, Liberty. As of now, the Blue Hens are fourth in the CUSA standings fighting for a spot in the conference tournament.
UD will need to finish as one of the best eight teams in the conference to make the conference tournament in its inaugural CUSA season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MR128677-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 15:57:00.367241

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) tapped Sen. Michael A. Jackson (D-Calvert, Charles & Prince George’s) as the next superintendent of the Maryland State Police Friday, replacing Col. Roland L. Butler who is set to retire Nov. 1.
Before he was elected to the legislature, Jackson spent 22 years in the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office, the last eight, from 2002-2010, as elected sheriff. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2014 and appointed to the Senate in 2021, winning reelection to the seat in 2022. He serves on the Budget and Taxation Committee.
“He’s one of our best members,” Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) said of Jackson’s work on the commitee “I’m thrilled for him. It’s a good opportunity for him. That makes me sad because he’s a really good friend and he’s really good on Budget and Tax.”

Butler took the helm at the State Police in early 2023, shortly after Moore’s inauguration. He became the first Black superintendent of the State Police in the agency’s history.
In a statement Friday afternoon, Moore applauded Butler for 31 years in law enforcement, calling him a “true public servant.”
“During Colonel Butler’s tenure at the helm of State Police, Maryland has become a national leader in crime reduction and public safety gains. He leaves behind a profound legacy as he enters retirement,” Moore said. “And I also know Senator Michael A. Jackson—an exceptional public servant in his own right—will build on the foundation Colonel Butler laid.”
Butler took the job after a lengthy career in the State Police, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau. But he faced a difficult confirmation battle, as a group of Black lawmakers argued that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers.
At the time, Jackson was one of four senators, all from Prince George’s County, to vote against Butler.
Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle a Justice Department investigation that found written and physical hiring tests used by the department discriminated against Black and female applicants.
The investigation in that began in 2022, before Butler’s tenure, and the funds were to be divided between 48 failed applicants. President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has since signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
Butler plans to retire Nov. 1, Moore said, and Jackson will take over Nov. 12. Lt. Col. Daniel C. Pickett will serve as superintendent in the interim.

It’s the second time House Speaker Pro Tempore Kate Hogan and Senate Assistant Majority Whip Julian Cyr have filed legislation (S 1504, H 2450) that would phase out the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals that do not break down fully in the environment and are linked to harmful health issues like thyroid disease, liver damage, some cancers and immune system suppression.
The bills gained favorable reports last session from the Joint Committee on Public Health and Health Care Financing, but died in House Ways and Means Committee last session. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that more than 99% of people in the U.S. have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood, according to Laurel Schaider, a senior scientist at Newton-based Silent Spring Institute who spoke at a State House briefing on Thursday.
PFAS are often used in nonstick, stain-resistant, waterproof and grease-resistant products. Well owners and users, farmers and firefighters from across Massachusetts have testified before the Legislature in recent years and gathered at the State House Thursday to discuss the illnesses and other issues that have resulted from water and soil contaminated with PFAS and firefighting gear designed with PFAS in it. 
“I think there’s two hurdles here. One is that we’re talking about complex policy related to environmental science, and the more that we learn about PFAS, the more we understand its ubiquity,” Cyr told the News Service. “As you build a statutory and then a regulatory scheme around it, this isn’t easy policymaking.”
“We continue to see that the manufacturers of products that contain PFAS have opposed these efforts in numerous states. Massachusetts is not immune from some of that opposition,” Cyr continued. In part that’s why the bill targets specifically how people are most exposed to PFAS, not how it’s present in industrial applications, Cyr said. 
The Legislature in 2024 passed a few measures, according to Hogan, including those phasing out PFAS in firefighter protective gear and increasing funds to MassDEP to provide support for PFAS testing.
Other lawmakers have filed varying forms of legislation this session aiming to address different PFAS-related issues. A delegation of Massachusetts lawmakers visited Maine in August in an attempt to better understand how the state tackled contamination caused by PFAS specifically related to sewage sludge on farms. 
“Massachusetts, we like to be in the vanguard of public health, of environmental health and safety. We are no longer in the vanguard. I think there are 13 or 14 other states that have passed some form of legislation related to PFAS. So we’re losing ground a bit,” Cyr said. 
Alaska, New Jersey and New Hampshire also recently passed laws specifically addressing PFAS used in firefighting equipment. States including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont have passed varying laws phasing out the use of PFAS.
The Massachusetts bill would establish a remediation fund to assist entities attempting to clean up PFAS from their water supply, as well as direct the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to include PFAS monitoring requirements. It’s based on recommendations from the PFAS Interagency Task Force, which Hogan and Cyr chaired and that came out with a report in 2022.
“We’re trying to keep our bill current,” Hogan said, naming biosolids and ambient air as additional PFAS-related issues she anticipates ahead. “What we’ve set forth will really be foundational to moving forward and to dealing with all of the aspects of PFAS that are going to keep making their way into the general public and our conversations about PFAS.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68e7e4225e6fe.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 14:57:30.273642

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers in at least 16 states this year introduced bills to regulate the use of automated license plate readers responsible for collecting large amounts of data on drivers across the country.
But just three states — Arkansas, Idaho and Virginia — enacted laws this session that establish or amend rules for law enforcement agencies using the high-tech camera systems and the manner in which license plate data should be stored. And this month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have restricted use of such data.
The new Arkansas law, which was signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in April, also allows nongovernmental entities, such as private landowners and commercial business owners, to use license plate cameras on the condition that the data is deleted after 60 days. State agencies and parking enforcement can store license plate data for up to 150 days.
Measures in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are still under consideration. While the Pennsylvania bill outlines a permitting process for state agencies interested in installing license plate cameras, the measures in Massachusetts and New Jersey aim to strengthen privacy protections by ensuring only authorized employees can access driver data.
Comprehensive data privacy laws go into effect in 8 more states this year

Automated or automatic license plate readers, also known as ALPRs, are high-speed camera and computer software systems that automatically capture license plate information as vehicles drive by. These readers, which are typically mounted on street poles or the roofs of police cars, also record the location, date and time that license plates are captured.
ALPRs have been used by law enforcement agencies for more than 20 years. The camera systems are typically used as a tool for traffic accident and crime investigations. 
Despite the technology’s popularity, privacy and technology groups have raised concerns over data storage and appropriate uses of ALPRs. 
License plate readers collect and store large amounts of data, which is susceptible to data breaches and hacking, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Several law enforcement agencies and officers have also used the technology to target immigrants and could track people seeking reproductive health care, according to an analysis from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.
Lawmakers in at least 10 states — Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Utah — introduced ALPR legislation this year that didn’t advance.
This month, Newsom vetoed a measure that would have restricted how and when police agencies use and share data collected by ALPRs. The bill, which was approved by the legislature amid reports police were misusing the data, also would have required agencies to undergo random audits by the state and to delete some collected data within 60 days.
In his veto message, Newsom said the measure “does not strike the delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring public safety,” citing examples of how the bill’s provisions could impede criminal investigations.
In New Jersey, Democratic legislators introduced another bill in June that would prohibit law enforcement agencies and individuals from sharing license plate information during interstate investigations into people seeking reproductive health care services, such as abortion, that are legal in New Jersey.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s fiscal debates usually circle the same questions: whether to cut taxes, which ones, and who pays the price. Lately, rapid growth in residential property values has thrown the property-tax formula out of balance. Instead of commissioning a serious study of how to fix it, some state leaders and candidates have floated proposals to cap or even eliminate property taxes. The idea sounds attractive on paper, but in practice it would destabilize the institutions most South Dakotans depend on: local schools, city services and county governments.
At the heart of the matter is a misunderstanding of the causes of the pain some homeowners are experiencing. There is little indication that total property taxes have taken an inordinate jump in recent years. Instead, an increase in home values has apparently distorted the formula for allocating property taxes between residential, ag and commercial property.
Meanwhile, state government lives mostly on sales taxes and federal transfers. Yet it is state officials and politicians, some with little to no experience in local governance, who are calling for property tax cuts while leaving their own revenue streams untouched.
This disconnect raises a larger question: What kind of reform does South Dakota really need? Businessman Toby Doeden, a political newcomer who wants to be governor, has suggested that he would “DOGE” state government, an acronym for Department of Government Efficiency that evokes the idea of slashing wasteful programs. But while such rhetoric resonates nationally, it misses the mark in South Dakota.
Unlike Washington, South Dakota’s state government isn’t awash in bloated agencies or ridiculous programs. Instead, it more closely resembles a struggling family-run shop: lean, underfunded, reliant on dated systems, and often vulnerable to inefficiencies or fraud. What the state lacks is not austerity but modernization. Outdated processes slow delivery of services. Fragmented structures increase costs. And the absence of coordinated, professional oversight leaves opportunities for improvement untapped.
A more constructive project would look less like DOGE and more like modernization and consolidation. Imagine a task force of seasoned executives from some of South Dakota’s best-run companies taking a hard look at state operations. With a mandate to find efficiencies, improve service delivery, and apply modern technology, such a group could identify changes that truly move the needle. The likely results: streamlined systems, smarter spending, and improved outcomes for citizens.
That is why proposals like Gov. Larry Rhoden’s 2024 bill to cap property-tax growth, which is now state law, or Doeden’s talk of eliminating property taxes feel misguided. These measures target the wrong level of government. Property taxes sustain local governments, which must balance budgets each year while maintaining schools, roads, and public safety.
When Pierre restricts their revenue without offering alternatives, the result is predictable: local officials are forced to cut programs or raise fees, shifting the burden in less transparent ways.

There is, of course, a more obvious option, one that almost no politician dares to talk about. South Dakota has too many governments. With 66 counties, hundreds of townships, and more than 150 school districts, the state maintains a costly system of governments with redundant and unnecessary facilities and employees. Consolidation of counties or school districts could lower administrative costs and deliver services more efficiently. Yet such structural reform demands courage, political will, and a willingness to confront entrenched local loyalties.
For now, state leaders and politicians prefer easier sound bites: cutting property taxes without tackling the underlying system. The contradiction is glaring. While protecting their own sales-tax revenue, state officials are restricting the lifeblood of local governments. The unanswered questions loom large: When revenues fall short, will the state step in with replacement funding? Or will school boards and city councils be left to close libraries, shorten school years, or defer infrastructure repairs?
Perhaps the better path for local government outsiders would be to first gain hands-on experience in local government. Let them run a school district or a county commission, grapple with balancing budgets, and decide which programs to cut when dollars run thin. Only then will they appreciate the complexities behind the talking points.
The real opportunity in South Dakota is not to starve local governments of revenue but to rethink how government at all levels operates. Modernization, efficiency, and consolidation, not blunt tax cuts, hold the key to a stronger, leaner state. What South Dakota needs is not a DOGE project, but a serious conversation about how to align its government structure with the realities of the 21st century.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A special election to fill an Arkansas House seat left vacant by a lawmaker’s resignation will be held June 9, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared Friday.
Rep. Carlton Wing, a North Little Rock Republican, resigned on Sept. 30 to become CEO and executive director of Arkansas PBS, necessitating the special election.
Sanders previously set June 9 for a special election to fill the Senate vacancy created when Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, died Sept. 2.
At least two Democrats and one Republican have said they intend to run for Wing’s vacant seat. Four Republicans have said they’ll run for the Senate District 26 seat left by Stubblefield.
Sanders’ proclamation on Friday set the party primary elections for March 3, the same day as other state primaries.
State law requires the governor to call a special election to fill a legislative vacancy as soon as possible after the seat is vacated. The law also requires the special election to be held within 150 days unless it is impractical or “unduly burdensome” to do so, which Sanders said it would be.
Sanders made the same determination in setting the primary and general election dates to fill the Senate seat and drew criticism from some Republicans and the state Democratic party, who said the dates deprive District 26 residents of a voice in the legislature’s fiscal session in April.
A resident of the Franklin County portion of District 26 filed a lawsuit Monday, asking a Pulaski County judge to move up the special election to December so the district’s voters can be represented in the 2026 fiscal session. Lawmakers likely will consider funding for construction of a controversial state prison in Franklin County during the session.
The filing period for candidates in the House race will begin at noon on Nov. 3 and end at noon on Nov. 12, according to Sanders’ proclamation. The political parties must issue certificates of nomination by noon on April 10, and the candidates must file the certificates by 5 p.m. on April 13.
Any Independent candidates for the special election must submit their notices of candidacy, political practices pledges, affidavits of eligibility and petitions to the Secretary of State’s office by noon on April 13.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Senate President Nicholas Scutari became the latest state lawmaker to call for an independent monitor to oversee the work of a state anti-corruption unit that has routinely seen cases tossed because of alleged prosecutorial missteps.
Scutari’s call comes a week after a Superior Court judge dismissed charges against more than a dozen correctional officers accused of misconduct and other charges brought by the state Attorney General’s Office’s public integrity and accountability office, commonly called the OPIA, over inmate beatings at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, New Jersey’s lone women’s prison.
“It is clear from the track record of the office that greater oversight and accountability are needed,” said Scutari (D-Union) in a statement. “The credibility of law enforcement is at stake. The public needs to have confidence in the ability of the office to carry out its responsibilities fairly, effectively and with adherence to the law. An independent monitor will help restore trust in the OPIA.”

Last week, Superior Court Judge Christopher J. Garrenger called the indictments against the correctional officers “unconstitutionally vague” because they did little to differentiate between the actions of each defendant, and cited a laggardly pace that ran afoul of New Jersey’s speedy trial rule.
Garrenger dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot reraise them at a future date, though the Attorney General’s Office is appealing his decision.
The dismissal was only the latest black eye for the OPIA. In 2022, judges dismissed charges brought by the office against a Lakewood rabbi accused of misappropriating more than $200,000 in school funds and a separate indictment against Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler, who was accused of providing police escorts to his own funeral home. A Superior Court judge dismissed revived charges against Rabbi Osher Eisemann last year.
In both cases, judges said prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence. Charges against a Paterson officer accused of shooting an unarmed man were dismissed for a similar reason when, 18 months in, prosecutors revealed evidence showed the man had a gun the morning of or the night before the shooting.
Also in 2022, a judge dismissed charges against a separate correctional officer accused of having ties to organized crime after prosecutors said investigators had failed to record an interrogation, as state law and the Attorney General’s Office require.
Racketeering charges against South Jersey powerbroker George Norcross and a bevy of allies — perhaps the OPIA’s most public case — were dismissed in February after a state judge said prosecutors had failed to state the elements of a crime. The office has appealed the dismissal.
The Attorney General’s Office did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
Scutari’s call for independent oversight of the state’s anti-corruption unit is notable — he is the state’s highest-ranking legislator — but it wasn’t the first.
At least six state senators belonging to both parties have called for stricter oversight or investigations into the office, as have New Jersey NAACP President Richard Smith and New Jersey AFL-CIO President Charles Wowkanech.
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), a former Union County sheriff and a vocal critic of the OPIA, has called for an investigation into the office and introduced legislation that would require it to more quickly review misconduct cases.
Then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal created the public integrity and accountability office in 2018 as a response to court decisions that weakened federal bribery and corruption laws and to boost public confidence in police oversight amid rising scrutiny of fatal police shootings.
In addition to corruption cases, the office investigates allegations of civil rights violations by authorities, reviews internal affairs complaints, and evaluates wrongful conviction claims.

The Detroit-based nonprofit Mothering Justice — which centers its work on the needs and rights of mothers and families, from paid sick leave to affordable child care — hosted the grand opening of their new center in Detroit’s Eastern Market neighborhood on Thursday evening. Community members, friends and family members, and Mothering Justice staff gathered to share their hopes for the new, larger space. 
“We are welcoming you here. Please come back, please visit, bring your friends,” Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Mothering Justice, said in an opening speech. “This space is living with all of the energy of all the movements and all of the causes that we are working for, for the liberation that we will see in our lifetime.”
While Mothering Justice is a national organization, their home has long been in Detroit — and that is intentional, Atkinson said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When you talk about issues that are affecting moms, you can’t not think about economic and health issues and Detroit is ground zero for how moms have been mistreated, overlooked, underrepresented,” she said. “We have one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the country, and also a lot of poverty. So when we’re talking about hitting those issues head on, we need to be in community, because we believe that the wisdom of the people who are affected by the issue is also what is going to change the world.”
“In 2025, we remain rooted in resistance. We will be ready for what’s to come,” said Liz Dupee, the team’s deputy director for strategic partnerships, as she welcomed guests into the space. “Our message is loud and clear: We won’t back down.”

Much of the work that Atkinson and her staff tackle involves the input of mothers in the community, especially mothers of color. Some of that involves qualitative research, led by Dr. Keiondra Grace, who noted how important it is to have a dedicated home for the work that she and her colleagues do. 
“I do a lot of interviews and focus groups and things like that. And so having this space is really helpful because then we can bring folks in,” she said, referencing an upcoming focus group on understanding how potential cuts to social programs like SNAP under the Trump administration are impacting mothers. 
It follows an October 2024 focus group, where mothers shared fears about those very cuts and how it could make things worse financially for them and their communities. 
“I’m really excited to talk at the end of the month to really understand, now that we are here in this space of, these things are likely going to happen, states don’t have money in the budget to really cover some of the things,” Grace added, “what they’re thinking and how they’re going to make ends meet, how they’re finding sources of resilience and joy, in spite of that.”

Other members similarly expressed excitement about having access to the space.
“We have access to what we need. We have full storage, and it just feels more comfortable,” said Toyja Bridges, an outreach coordinator who runs sessions known as Cocoa Conversations to connect with mothers in the community. “It’s just that one less thing that we don’t have to worry about, so it keeps you kind of focused on what’s important.”
“I’m excited to bring mamas here. I’m excited to have one-on-ones here,” said Christina Hayes, an organizer who manages work on ballot initiatives put forward by Mothering Justice. 
As she works towards a potential state-level ballot initiative on paid family leave, she noted the many considerations for that goal, from finances to ballot signatures. But the new home for Mothering Justice, she said, will be key to getting the community input that she needs to make it happen. 
But Atkinson also noted that the new office is not just helpful for research and advocacy — it’s also set up to be a place where mothers feel welcome. There is a kitchen, as well as a room specifically set up for kids to play, a very intentional setup. 
“This space means a lot for us,” Atkinson said. “It’s our first physical home since COVID. And having a place where moms can come, whether they work here or they’re just involved in the movement in some way, is really important because it just allows for collaboration, like a safe space and your babies can be loud here.”

In 2024, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy filed charges against the Food Land Pharmacy of Woodbine, alleging that on July 18, 2023, a Harrison County home-health worker noticed that the medication she was giving her patient did not match the description on the pill bottle.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In October 2023, the board alleged, the pharmacy failed to update its records by removing a “duplicative therapy” for a customer and as a result, the pharmacy dispensed the wrong strength of his medication for three months.
Around that time, another patient was allegedly given a lower-strength medication than was prescribed. The board also alleged that in July and August 2023, Food Land Pharmacy employed Sabine Guinn as a pharmacy technician despite Guinn’s lack of a registration as a pharmacy technician. The store failed to determine whether Guinn had the required registration before putting her to work in the store, the board alleges.
As part of a settlement agreement with the board, the store agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and have all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians undergo additional training in patient safety and medication errors.
Also in 2024, the Board of Pharmacy alleged that pharmacist Christopher Steele of Underwood had incorrectly filled prescriptions for at least four patients in 2023. Steele told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the errors occurred at the Food Land Pharmacy where he worked.
Steele agreed to settle the disciplinary case by paying a $1,000 civil penalty and having his license placed on probation for one to two years.
Second set of charges filed in 2025
Earlier this year, the board charged Food Land Pharmacy with 10 additional regulatory violations — an exceptionally large number of violations for a pharmacy of that size.
The charges include failing to follow board rules related to recordkeeping, failing to follow board rules related to temporary pharmacy staff, failing to follow proper procedures related to controlled-substance registrations, failing to follow proper procedures for a change in the pharmacist in charge, failing to follow board rules related to accountability of controlled substances, failing to follow rules related to system security and safeguards, and failing to comply with the required drug utilization review process for a patient.
According to the board, those charges are tied to five separate complaints received by the board in the spring of 2024, and are tied to allegations of poor recordkeeping and lack of oversight concerning controlled substances.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, the pharmacy’s representatives recently agreed to surrender the business’ pharmacy license.
Food Land lawsuit led to major court decision
Court records show that Steele’s hiring at Food Land resulted in a significant court decision on the scope of a state law that legislators passed in 2022 in an effort to discourage price gouging by staffing agencies working for health care entities.
Shortly after the legislation was signed into law, a staffing agency called PharmServ Solutions sued the Food Land store, alleging the store had asked PharmServ to provide a pharmacist for six days in early 2022. PharmServ routed Steele to the job, after which Food Land allegedly hired Steele as a permanent employee of the store’s pharmacy. PharmServ then sued Food Land, alleging the store was refusing to pay an agreed-upon fee of up to $30,000 for Steele’s hiring.
Food Land argued the new price-gouging law prohibited employment agencies in the health care field from charging fees when temporary workers were hired by the agency’s clients on a permanent basis.
PharmServ argued the law didn’t apply since Food Land was not a “health care entity” as defined by the legislation. A Harrison County judge disagreed and dismissed the lawsuit while ruling that the new law applied to Iowa pharmacies and pharmacists.

Former Gillette librarian announced the settlement of her lawsuit against Campbell County and conservatives on the library board days before a key legislative meeting.
The post Fired Wyoming librarian hopes $700,000 settlement deters conservative lawmakers. They say it won’t. appeared first on WyoFile .","The Gillette librarian who this week settled a lawsuit against Campbell County over her July 2023 firing for a $700,000 payment says she hopes Wyoming lawmakers take note of the hefty sum.
Terri Lesley sued in April, alleging the Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees violated her First Amendment right to free speech and dismissed her in retaliation for her opposition to efforts by local conservatives to control where LGBTQ-centered books appeared in the library.
“My hope is that this will be a deterrent,” Lesley told WyoFile on Thursday, “that we can shut down all these censorship efforts in Wyoming and beyond.” 
But two Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers who want the Legislature to weigh in on library materials statewide were quick to dismiss the idea that the hefty settlement should serve as a warning. The settlement does not include an admission of guilt by the county or trustees, they said, and is a separate matter from their legislative efforts.
The lawsuit Lesley settled this week was one of two she’s brought since her firing, with the second coming against members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director.
That lawsuit remains ongoing. Both suits were filed in federal court.
The Gillette News Record broke the story Wednesday and it quickly became a national news story. That news came just days ahead of a pivotal legislative committee hearing in Wyoming’s ongoing political debate over who should control access to library books. Lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee will vote Monday on whether to bring a bill to the 2026 legislative session that would impose steep fines on public libraries and schools that leave books containing sexual material in places accessible to minors. 
Lesley, her lawyers, and a group of Wyoming advocacy organizations, librarians and other bill opponents see the court settlement as vindication of their stance against such laws.

“This case is about accountability and the rule of law,” Azra Taslimi, one of Lesley’s attorneys, told WyoFile. “It’s about what happens when government officials cross a constitutional line and try to prevent and punish a public servant for doing her job. Ms. Lesley was fired for standing up for the First Amendment, and the $700,000 settlement speaks volumes. It says the censorship has consequences that are legal as well as financial.”
Taslimi, who said her firm has worked on cases on behalf of librarians in other states, described efforts to regulate the material available in Wyoming  libraries as part of a nationwide push by conservative politicians to censure LGBTQ literature.
“These bills are not about protecting children,” Taslimi said. “They’re about controlling what people can read, think and talk about. What these bills are really trying to do is criminalize inclusion and erase stories that make some politicians uncomfortable.”
Lawmakers undeterred
In text messages to WyoFile, two House lawmakers from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, who have been prominent advocates for regulating young people’s access to some books, indicate the lawsuit is unlikely to dissuade their efforts.
Rep. Anne Lucas, a Cheyenne Republican, Freedom Caucus-endorsed lawmaker and architect of the legislation now in front of the Judiciary Committee, told WyoFile the lawsuit settlement did not give her any pause in pushing forward. 
“The Library isn’t admitting any wrongdoing,” she wrote of the settlement agreement, and “by accepting it, Ms. Lesley agrees.” 
Lucas described the lawsuit as “an employment case, not a first amendment case and has nothing to do with legislative considerations.”
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, whose wife Sage Bear is a library trustee and was a defendant in the lawsuit, accused Lesley of being out for money, not standing on principle. 
“It is clear that the terminated librarian was more concerned about fleecing her prior employer than the supposed altruistic motive of standing up for LGBTQ rights,” Bear wrote. 
“I don’t believe the county’s insurance company or their attorneys should have settled this case, but I understand the business decision to attempt to keep costs of frivolous litigation minimized,” Bear wrote. Instead, he called for reform to Wyoming’s tort laws, which govern civil lawsuits and allow people like Lesley to sue for damages. 
Until lawmakers pass such reforms, “the left will always take advantage,” he wrote. 
The library book bill currently under consideration would likely open the door for more lawsuits against the government, but from people on the political right. The legislation creates a pathway for citizens to sue schools and libraries they believe are violating the rules. 
For her part, Lesley described standing up to political pressure for two years before her firing, including that brought by Sage Bear, as personally difficult but driven by obligations to her work and community. The same was true of her decision to sue, she said. 
“It has been very hard,” she told WyoFile. “But I felt like I had to do it, that I had to stand up for the First Amendment. It’s what libraries are about.” 
Lesley had worked in the Campbell County library system for nearly thirty years before she was fired.
Conservatives behind book regulating measures have pushed past legal warnings before. In Campbell County, the library trustees fired Lesley despite an explicit warning against doing so from a deputy county attorney in March 2022. In hindsight, the attorney nearly predicted this week’s settlement years before it became reality. 
“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in Lesley’s lawsuit.
On Thursday, Rep. Bear continued to uphold the efforts of Campbell County conservatives, which resulted in the contested books ultimately being moved into the adult section of the library after Lesley’s firing. 
“Gillette public libraries are the first in the nation to stop the left’s onslaught on the innocence of children by moving books that sexualize children to the adult section of the library,” Bear wrote to WyoFile. “Is $700,000 too much to pay to save our children?”
But Lesley, who still lives in Gillette, said she does not believe the Freedom Caucus speaks for most Wyomingites on the issue. 
“I think they are representing a minority,” she said, describing herself as a fourth-generation resident of the state. “It’s a live-and-let live kind of state, and I just don’t see the people I know signing on to this.”

The librarian has received an outpouring of support from around Wyoming since taking her stand against the efforts to remove library books that began in Gillette in 2021, she said. At the special meeting where Lesley was fired, hundreds of people showed up to support her, while a few dozen residents attended to back the board, according to Gillette News Record reporting at the time. 
Legislative debate
Lawmakers have also seen mounting public opposition as Monday’s bill has moved through the interim period. In Casper in August, they faced a packed meeting room, the majority of whom were there in opposition to the bill, though it also drew supporters. Testimony at that meeting included a Methodist pastor who read lawmakers sexually explicit passages from the Bible — arguing their legislation would censure that religious text from children’s eyes as well.

In Cheyenne on Monday, the Judiciary Committee will not take further public testimony, having sat through hours of it in Casper. The Legislative Service Office’s website already lists four proposed amendments, and lawmakers are likely to bring more on the spot. Ahead of the meeting, advocacy groups have continued to call on their members to write lawmakers in opposition to the measure.
“Terri Lesley stood up for freedom, families, and the First Amendment, and she was proven right,” Nate Martin, a Laramie school board member and director of one such group, Better Wyoming, told WyoFile. “Now, as lawmakers consider a statewide ban along the lines of Campbell County’s, and they’re getting a thousand individuals contacting them in opposition to the bill, they’re finding out that the people of Wyoming don’t like book bans any more than the courts do.”
Local political activists, namely the Bennett family, did not just push for Lesley’s firing, they also sought to have her prosecuted. The Bennetts in 2021 pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to prosecute Lesley for providing obscene material to minors.
Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes, according to that still-active lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet state statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
The bill in front of the Joint Judiciary Committee would circumvent that language, which is derived from the legal test established by a pivotal 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case. In that case, Miller v. California, the justices found that literature or other content that carried those broader values could not be regulated as obscene without violating the First Amendment. 
Monday’s draft bill instead would insert into Wyoming law a list of definitions of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. 
The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus.” But critics say it does not take in the value or purpose of the work as a whole — like the more graphic passages of the Bible, which play into larger themes of the religious text. 
It would instead, Lesley said, allow conservative activists to go in and cherry pick sections of texts that offend them, without considering what value those books may bring young readers.
The current draft bill carries a suggestion from the Legislative Service Office — the state attorneys who draft bills and guide lawmakers on how to avoid conflicts with existing or constitutional law. 
“The Committee may wish to consider the use of the existing definition for ‘obscene’ as the designation of sexually explicit material,” LSO staff attorneys wrote in the bill draft. They are referring to the language derived by the Miller case, and cited by the county prosecutors who declined to criminally charge Lesley.

Administrators and teachers at the Danville School say closure could harm students with learning disabilities, who they say are underserved by nearby private high schools and would face long travel times to other public schools.

Danville residents are poised to vote in December on whether to shutter its high school grades at the Danville School and instead pay tuition for students to attend other schools, following a petition submitted to the school board Tuesday.
The petition has set the district on a collision course with a potential outcome public school faculty say would be devastating for the region’s most vulnerable students. The school board proposed a Dec. 6 special meeting for the vote, though the meeting won’t be officially set until next month. If the vote is successful, Danville School’s grades 9 through 12 would close by June 30.
The district would then pay tuition for those high school students to attend public or private schools, according to the language of the petition.
The potential closure of Danville’s high school presents troubling implications for public school students in the area, and has underscored long-held contentions around whether the region’s public and private schools share the same responsibility to serve students with disabilities or with other academic achievement barriers — a population on the rise in Vermont.
“They don’t have to take your kids,” David Warren, a Danville School social studies teacher, said Tuesday about two larger neighboring private schools. “And how do I know? Because we’ve been giving kids from those schools here in Danville a second chance.”
Danville School Principal Natalie Conway wrote to the school board in advance of its Oct. 7 meeting that the high school closure would leave “our area of the (Northeast Kingdom) a public high school desert.”
The closest high school would be St. Johnsbury Academy, followed by Lyndon Institute, both private institutions and designated by Vermont law as “independent schools” that are eligible to receive public dollars as tuition from school districts lacking public schools serving those grades. 
Since 2022, Vermont State Board of Education rules have required schools that accept public dollars to educate students eligible for special education services. However, Danville public school leaders and faculty have said they believe students with disabilities would go underserved by the closure — a claim that their counterparts at St. Johnsbury Academy refute.
“Students from all walks of life and all abilities who need a second chance, a smaller school, or more individual attention and support find a home in Danville School,” Conway said in her letter. “Students with disabilities find a home at Danville School.”
‘Imagine the costs’
The Danville school district, like many in the state, finds itself on shaky ground as Vermont works toward a major overhaul of its public education system.
Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law in July, calls for a vast consolidation of the state’s 119 school districts and a reorganization of how the state funds education.
A redistricting task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and other experts, is tasked with crafting new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system in time for next year’s legislative session, which begins in early January.
But many fear the law’s implementation could mean the closure of small schools, pointing to required minimum average class sizes of at least 18 students for grades 9 through 12.
The petition, Danville board members wrote in a letter to the state’s redistricting task force after the Tuesday meeting, “is a direct result of great uncertainty due to Act 73 and your task force’s mission.”
Danville School hosts about 344 students from kindergarten through high school from Danville and surrounding towns, with roughly 70 students in the high school grades, according to district board Chair Clayton Cargill.
For the past month, the school board members have weighed whether to get ahead of changes envisioned by the new education law.

Their district is a member of the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union, which includes the Cabot and Twinfield school districts. Both of those districts also operate a K-12 school, with high school grades even smaller in size than Danville’s.
The uncertainty around Danville School’s future spurred a financial analysis, presented by board member Eric Hewitt during a September school board meeting. The analysis suggested that tuitioning out Danville’s high school students may produce a lower tax rate than if it were to continue operating its high school grades.
But that analysis has since been questioned by other board members and community members.
Cargill said in an interview Wednesday that the analysis did not take into account high school-aged students in Danville whose families currently pay for private school and would take advantage of a tuition system.
There is also the expense of ensuring that the district’s obligations to students with disabilities are being met, Danville high school’s principal noted in her letter. 
The next closest public high schools, Hazen Union and Lake Region Union, are each at least a 30-minute drive away from Danville School, Conway wrote.
“Imagine the costs associated with this transportation for general and special education students,” she wrote. “Imagine the costs for us as a (Northeast Kingdom) community associated with students who struggle to attend school dropping out at higher rates than we already experience.”
A state senator’s opinion
Nearby school boards have had similar discussions about potentially closing their high school grades. For Danville and Cabot, those discussions were prompted by a warning from Vermont Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, the chamber’s minority leader, according to their school board chairs. Those warnings were first reported last week by Seven Days.
Beck, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy, warned school district and community leaders that lawmakers would likely seek to limit a district’s ability to offer its students the choice of attending a private school after a school closure in the next phase of educational reform.
Beck pointed to specific language that had been in an earlier version of the legislation requiring school districts that close a school to designate just three public schools to receive their students.
The Cabot School District had previously considered circulating a survey to residents about closing their schools and opting for school choice. But Cabot school board Chair Chris Tormey, said in an email this week that the board has decided to hold off on the survey “until we find out next year how Cabot School will be placed within the new statewide map.”
Audience members at the Danville board meeting were split on the urgency of making a decision about the high school. But several attendees zeroed in on accusations that Beck had unduly influenced the petitioners by spreading false information.

Warren, the high school social studies teacher, said the motivation behind the petition was “flat out wrong,” that the Act 73 process would not necessarily lead to the high school’s closure.
“Despite what you hear about small schools, we do offer a quality education. And about this decision, the politician that is behind it, in my opinion, is a coward, and worse, a bully,” Warren said.
Cargill said at the meeting that he felt he had been misled by Beck. 
“I paraded this information around town, and told people this information, and I feel lied to in the situation,” he said. “I feel like I’m part of a problem here.”
Beck refuted claims that he had a conflict of interest, and said in an interview Wednesday that he was merely offering his opinion to his constituents.
“People can certainly disagree with me, that’s fine, but I was straightforward,” he said. What he has been telling school district leaders like Cargill “is that I don’t think that you have forever to have this conversation.”
“I don’t think I misled or lied to anybody,” Beck continued. “It’s the opinion I conveyed last summer and it’s the opinion I still have today.”
‘We don’t do that’
Danville School faculty argue their school plays an outsized role in serving students with intellectual disabilities and from poorer backgrounds.
And without Danville’s high school grades, “there are going to be a fair number of students who will not be provided the opportunity for the free and appropriate education that they also deserve,” Beth Nishball-Williams, a special educator at the Danville School, wrote in a letter to the school board.
“Where do our autistic, intellectually disabled, multiple handicapped students go?” Nishball-Williams wrote. “Where do our students with social anxiety, speech and concerns, depression, or trauma go?”
That claim is partly borne out in public data, released last month by the Agency of Education in response to requests from the redistricting task force about the concentration of students with individual education plans, or IEPs, in different schools and school districts.

Twenty-two percent of Danville School students are on IEPs, while 49% are eligible for the federal free or reduced lunch program, indicating they live in households earning less than 185% the federal poverty level, according to data from the Agency of Education for the 2023-24 school year. 
Twenty-five percent of students from other school districts who attend Danville School are on IEPs, while 62% are on a free or reduced lunch program, according to that data. Data from previous years was not available.
Meanwhile, only 8.7% of St. Johnsbury Academy’s student body are on IEPs, according to that data, while just over 14% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
Lyndon Institute has higher percentages — 19.52% of the school’s student body are on IEPs, while just under 22% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
The data suggests that the academy is not enrolling students with disabilities. St. Johnsbury Academy officials contend that the opposite is true — that their low percentage of students with IEPs shows that they’re making progress toward the mandates in Act 173, Vermont’s 2022 special education law that sought to increase effectiveness of support services.
Academy Headmaster Sharon Howell said it was “patently false” that they are not serving students with IEPs, and said “the fact that we have fewer students on IEPs is not an indicator of failure. It’s actually a success story.”
Mathew Foster, the director of student services at St. Johnsbury Academy, said the data discrepancy is due the fact that some students are designated as being on 504 plans versus IEPs. The 504 plan categorization is another federal designation for students who need special support for learning, and does not follow the same procedures and requirements that an IEP would.
Howell said the academy’s philosophy is to shift their enrolled students with IEPs toward 504 plans or other in-house support services.
“Our philosophy is we want students to be able to do as well as they can, to be able to move into general education classes when that’s appropriate, so not just be stuck in individualized services classes in content areas, but to actually join some of the some of the gen-ed classes, if that’s appropriate,” she said.
Data provided by the academy for the 2023-24 school year shows a number of publicly funded students — about 24% — enrolled at the school are on IEPs, 504 plans, or “other support plans.”
Lyndon Institute officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Administrators and teachers at the Danville School nonetheless say their school is the fallback serving those students in the region.
In her letter, Danville School special educator Nishball-Williams wrote that “the truth is not everyone will be successful” at the two nearby private schools. She said she works with students from most of the surrounding towns that tuition out their students.
“I know this first hand because in the past five years I’ve had students on my caseload from Barnet, Peacham, Walden, Cabot, Lyndon, St. Johnsbury, Concord and Sheffield, as well as Danville,” Nishball-Williams wrote.
Caledonia Central Supervisory Union Superintendent Matt Foster said the nearby academies “don’t have to, nor (do) they, gear to try to meet the needs” of all students.
“There is flexibility at the academies where they are able to basically say, ‘We don’t do that’ with certain populations,” Foster said.
“Those aren’t my schools, so I can’t say what exactly they’re doing or not doing at this point in time,” he added, “but they definitely have a history of saying there are certain students that they don’t feel equipped to be able to take.”
‘An existential crisis’
The petition delivered at Tuesday’s meeting was organized by Peter Mantius, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy.
“It’s my hope that every voting resident shows up at our special meeting fully informed and capable of voting on maybe the most important decision this town is going to make in a generation,” Mantius said during the meeting.
Mantius did not respond to a request for comment, but said during the September board meeting and in an op-ed published in the Caledonia Record that he and others had concerns similar to Beck’s — that the Legislature may soon block the district’s ability to adopt school choice.

Hewitt, the Danville School board member, was asked during Tuesday’s meeting for his position on potentially closing the school. He said he wanted more clarity on what comes of the redistricting task force.
“The question is, how is the redistricting community committee viewing us, Danville, in our current situation,” Hewitt said.
The school board, in its letter to the task force, asked members for clarity.
“We are at risk of making a very reactionary decision that will change this town considerably in
unforeseen ways,” the board’s letter reads. “With the lack of certainty or clarity around what will happen to a school like ours, which is in a remarkably unique situation in the state, we are forced to assume and plan for the worst case scenario, and do everything in our power to prevent it.”
Cargill expressed similar concerns before the meeting.
“We’ve been operating a pretty successful high school that we’re proud of throughout all these years,” Cargill said in an interview last week. “I think that’s the truth, but with what the state is forcing now, we’re sort of sitting in an existential crisis.”

,DC,2025-10-10 17:17:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/substantial-layoffs-federal-workers-launched-trump-administration-amid-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Friday it had begun mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns and one that could significantly reshape the size and scope of the government. White House budget director Russ Vought posted on social media mid-day that Reductions in Force, the technical name for layoffs, had started.“The RIFs have begun,” Vought wrote.  Vought didn’t share any other details on social media and a budget office spokesperson only said that the layoffs would be ""substantial"" after States Newsroom asked for information about how many federal workers and which departments would be impacted. The government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to pass a short-term spending bill.President Donald Trump has signaled for the last couple weeks that if Democrats didn’t help Republicans advance the stopgap funding bill in the Senate, he would take action. “I’ll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on,” Trump said Tuesday. “If this keeps going on it’ll be substantial and a lot of those jobs will never come back.”Trump said Thursday that he would cut funding approved by Congress for programs he believes are supported by or generally benefit Democrats, but he didn’t provide any more details during a Cabinet meeting. Trump has also floated the idea of not providing back pay for furloughed federal employees, though he hasn’t made any firm determinations about whether he may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that guarantees back pay for all federal workers after a shutdown ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimated before the shutdown began that some 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed. Others have continued working but without pay.Thune blames ‘far-left activist base’ for shutdownVought’s announcement came just as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wrapped up a joint press conference on Capitol Hill, where they called on Democrats to vote to reopen the government. “We have a majority of United States senators — 55 out of 100 senators are voting to open up the government,” Thune said. “We need five bold, courageous Democrats with a backbone who are willing to take on their far-left activist base and join us in passing this.”Thune largely rejected the idea floated by some Republican lawmakers that the chamber should get rid of the 60-vote threshold for advancing major legislation, which has so far blocked the House-passed stopgap spending bill from moving toward final passage. “There are folks out there that think that is the way we ought to do things around here, simple majority,” Thune said. “But I can tell you that the filibuster through the years has been something that has been a bulwark against a lot of bad things happening to the country.”Thune added the legislative filibuster, which is different from the talking filibuster that most people are familiar with, is necessary to protect the rights of the minority political party and give it a voice in running the government. Johnson nixes vote again on military payJohnson, R-La., remained consistent during an earlier press conference that he will not bring the House back into session to vote on a bill to ensure on-time pay for military members during the shutdown. He’s repeatedly said the best way to avoid delayed paychecks for federal workers is for Democrats to advance the House-passed stopgap spending bill. The stalemate over government funding largely revolves around whether congressional leaders will be able to find bipartisan compromise and enact legislation to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which are set to expire at the end of the year.Democrats argue lawmakers need to broker an agreement now, before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Republican leaders contend they’re willing to talk after the government reopens, but they haven’t provided any commitments and have been tight-lipped about what they’d be willing to consider. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a morning press conference before the layoff announcement that Republicans must compromise on health care. “What we’ve said to our Republican colleagues is we have to address the health care crisis that they’ve created decisively — that means legislatively and that means right now,” Jeffries said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)This weekend, festivals celebrating Acadian and Creole culture will take over the Lafayette area, but some Canadians won’t be coming. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, says their absence is because of rhetoric from the White House, and he’s asking President Donald Trump for an apology.
Since taking office in January for his second term, Trump has made several comments about Canada becoming the 51st state and has chastised the country in his ongoing international trade war. Just this week, in a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cracked a joke about a “merger” of the two countries. 
During a recent trip to the country to promote Louisiana tourism, Nungesser said many Canadians upset by Trump’s remarks told him they’re staying away from the U.S. — and Louisiana. Nungesser is now asking the president to apologize to Canadians in hopes of stopping the loss of tourism and diplomatic relations.
“They just pretty much said that they’re not coming back until he’s either out of office or he apologizes,” Nungesser said.
This weekend is the start of the Grand Reveil Acadien, or “Great Acadian Awakening,” near Lafayette, Louisiana. The nine-day festival happens every five years and celebrates the Acadians, descendants of early French settlers who came to Louisiana from Canada in the 1700s. It typically attracts many tourists from Canada, but some will not be making the trek this year because of Trump.
At least one tour company with plans of bringing four charter buses full of people canceled, according to Randal Menard, the president of the non-profit that puts on the festival.
“ After the tariffs and the president’s comments, he let us know that people were dropping like flies,” Menard said.
Trump’s trade war risks undoing Michigan’s hard-earned progress

Nungesser hasn’t heard back from the president and admits that an apology might not fully fix the issue. But he doesn’t know what else to do.
Tourism from Canada is down 20% to 30%, he said, and data from Canada shows a 25% drop in U.S. visits in July compared to last year.
He said the U.S. has become an unpopular destination for Canadians.
“Airlines still have the flights, but they’re not advertising travel to America,” Nungesser said.
As for this weekend, Grand Reveil Acadien will go on and will be flooded with Louisiana French music and the smells of good ol’ Louisiana cooking. But locals will celebrate without many of their Canadian cousins, said Menard.
“I mean, we’re gonna miss their presence. The program will go on, but it’s not gonna be the same without their participation,” Menard said.
He hopes their absence will only be temporary.

,DC,2025-10-10 17:10:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump undertakes a MAGA-centric makeover of US civics education,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-undertakes-maga-centric-makeover-us-civics-education,,"WASHINGTON — A slew of conservative groups will lead a new coalition to spur civics education and push the subject in a more patriotic direction, the U.S. Education Department announced last month, raising alarms for some traditional civics and education groups that were not included in the initiative.The America First Policy Institute, a think tank with close ties to the president, is organizing and coordinating the America 250 Civics Education Coalition made up of more than 40 national and state-based groups, including prominent conservative advocacy organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA.The vast majority of the groups in the coalition promote a vision of U.S. identity that downplays historical wrongs associated with race and gender and projects the country as an exceptional force for good. Many are well-known conservative groups that have promoted President Donald Trump’s political agenda.The coalition lacks many of the more traditional civics education groups who say their nonpartisanship is a fundamental element of civics education, leading to concerns from those groups that civics education is really the initiative’s goal. “Our organization serves students in every state and over 80% of counties,” said Shawn Healy, the chief policy and advocacy officer at iCivics, a group that promotes public support for civics education. “You can’t do that if your curriculum is shaded red or blue — it has to be fiercely nonpartisan.”The coalition will have nothing to do with school curricula, a department official said last month, acknowledging that the agency legally cannot dictate what schools teach. And it will not receive any federal funding from the department, the official added.But the agency has taken other steps that appear designed to steer curricula in a more partisan direction.The same day the coalition launched, the department announced it would be prioritizing “patriotic education” when it comes to discretionary grants. The agency said patriotic education “presents American history in a way that is accurate, honest, and inspiring.”Earlier in September, the department said it would invest more than $160 million in American history and civics grants — a $137 million increase in the funds Congress previously approved.Civics as cultural battlegroundCivics — a branch of social studies that focuses on rights and obligations of citizenship and the basic mechanics of government — has been a bipartisan priority, though it’s become a hot-button issue within education culture wars regarding how and what is taught as America grapples with its complicated history. Many on the political right, including Trump, have long bristled at how that history is taught. Going back to his first presidency, Trump has sought to exert control over the subject.After retaking office in January, he reestablished the 1776 Commission — an advisory committee meant “to promote patriotic education.”“Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains,” notes the executive order first establishing the commission during his first term. The commission released a 41-page report in January 2021 that drew criticism from historians and educators, including the American Historical Association.In a statement signed by 47 other organizations, the association wrote that the report makes “an apparent attempt to reject recent efforts to understand the multiple ways the institution of slavery shaped our nation’s history.” Trump formed the commission after The New York Times published the 1619 Project, which aimed to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.” Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA sign up In its September announcement, the department said the coalition “is dedicated to renewing patriotism, strengthening civic knowledge, and advancing a shared understanding of America’s founding principles in schools across the nation.” The coalition will include more than 100 events and programs across the country over the next year as part of the administration’s celebration of the country’s 250th anniversary. The coalition is set to feature a 50-state “Trail to Independence Tour,” a “Fundamental Liberties College Speaker Series” as well as “Patriotic K-12 Teacher Summits and Toolboxes” aimed at supporting “patriotic teaching nationwide.” The America 250 Civics Education Coalition includes right-wing organizations like the Heritage Foundation — the architect of the sweeping conservative policy agenda known as Project 2025 — as is America First Legal, a conservative advocacy group founded by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. Turning Point USA, co-founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September, is also part of the initiative. PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that has drawn questions among researchers and scholars regarding the accuracy of its content, was also listed as a member of the coalition.Education Secretary Linda McMahon was the chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute between her roles in the first and second Trump administrations. She had to sign an ethics waiver to participate in the coalition, according to the department official, who did not provide further details on what exactly this entailed. ‘News to us’While conservative political organizations were made part of the coalition, leading civics education groups were not even aware of it before its public launch.“Certainly, it was news to us about this coalition being formed,” Healy, of iCivics, said.Healy added that his group encourages the America 250 Civics Education Coalition “to be more pluralistic in orientation” and that the organization is “eager” to have a conversation with the coalition about what they’re doing.iCivics, a nonpartisan organization founded in 2009 by the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, launched CivxNow. The latter group describes itself as the country’s “largest cross-partisan coalition working to prioritize civic education in the United States.”CivxNow’s nearly 400 members comprise a broad swath of mainstream civics education groups. “It’s our fundamental belief, both as an organization and as a coalition, that civic education has to be fiercely nonpartisan and nonideological,” Healy said. But only one group — Constituting America — is a member of both CivxNow and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition. Momentum for civicsOthers in the civics education field said the added attention the initiative brings to the subject will be positive.The coalition “provides an opportunity for everyone interested in civic education and patriotic education to do something right now,” said Donna Phillips, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Civic Education, pointing to “decades where there hasn’t been enough, or any, attention to civic education.” Phillips, whose organization is a member of CivxNow, said she hopes “the civic education field more widely can benefit from the momentum behind the need for this and that we can all find a place within this momentum and this moment.” Hans Zeiger, president of the nonpartisan Jack Miller Center, described the administration’s initiative as the “latest development in what we take to be a growing movement for civics in the country.” Zeiger, whose organization aims to empower college professors to work on civics education and is a member of CivxNow, said his group is “very interested in growing the national civics movement, and glad that there are people all across the political spectrum getting involved in the push for civic education.”“It is always a good thing to have national dialogue on civics education,” the National Council for the Social Studies said in a statement. The council, part of CivxNow, added that they “strive for balanced conversations that will continue to elevate high quality social studies standards.” Teachers unions criticize coalition  The two major teachers unions, which are politically aligned with Democrats, blasted the coalition as unserious, and noted the lack of traditional civics groups.“We have decades of research on what works in civic education,” Mary Kusler, senior director at the National Education Association’s Center for Advocacy, said in a statement to States Newsroom. “The proposal they are peddling lacks the rigor and respect our students deserve — which is evident by the lack of any respected civics or civil rights organizations as signers.”Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement the 250th anniversary of the nation should have been “an opportunity for parents, teachers, historians and students to learn, celebrate, critique and think critically about our democracy.”“Instead, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition rushed to create programming based on a single Trump-approved, ideological narrative, excluding the very people who know our history best: civics teachers and historians,” she said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Gov. Newsom introduced CARE Court to bring more people experiencing severe mental illness into treatment. It has helped fewer people than he projected, but a new law will make more people eligible for it.


One of Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s marquee mental health programs may broaden its reach despite persistent questions about the number of people it’s helping and whether it’s achieving the goals he set out for it when it launched.
Newsom today signed a law that expands eligibility for CARE Court to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder. Under the law’s previous constraints, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders were eligible.
Newsom in a written statement called the law and its expansion an important part of his administration’s efforts to bring people with serious mental illness into treatment. 
“California doesn’t sit on the sidelines while people fall through the cracks,” he said. “We don’t stand by while people spiral on our sidewalks or cycle through emergency rooms and jail cells — we step up. We built CARE Court to connect people to treatment, dignity, and accountability — because care and accountability belong at the center of how we serve our communities.”
Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022, creating a program that allows family members, first responders, doctors and others to petition the courts on behalf of people with severe psychosis who couldn’t care for themselves. 
Once a petition is accepted, individuals are presented with a voluntary treatment plan, which can include counseling, medication and housing. If they refuse, a judge can, in theory, order them to participate in a treatment plan.
Almost two years in, CARE Court has struggled to fulfill Newsom’s initial promises. A recent CalMatters investigation found that the program has so far reached a few hundred people, far short of the thousands originally projected. 
The new law, by Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat, sailed through the Legislature with nearly unanimous bipartisan support, no votes against and just a handful of abstentions. 
“The beauty of CARE Court is that it holds both institutions and individuals accountable, ensures individuals get the care they need and gives judges a clear role in overseeing and guiding the process,” Umberg said in a written statement today. “This bill focuses on implementation by listening to and learning from counties about what’s working and what’s not, in order to meet the goals of the original CARE Court legislation.”
But the bill faced plenty of criticism in the community, with counties questioning how they will implement an expanded program on a tight timeline and disability rights advocates raising concerns about the effectiveness of a program they consider “unimplementable.”
“We have to tell the truth,” said Lex Steppling, a founding member of All People’s Health Collective. “This is not workable. It’s not going to be workable. And I personally believe the cracks in the foundation are getting bigger and bigger and it’s going to collapse.”  
Steppling saved his harshest criticism for “the state’s self-described ‘liberal and progressive’ politicians,” who he said were too afraid of the Newsom administration to oppose the bill.
Wide estimates on CARE Court expansion
Umberg’s legislation could expand CARE Court enrollment, though it’s unclear by how much. Umberg’s office doesn’t have an estimate of how many more people will be eligible for the program under the new parameters. San Diego County said the new rules could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%.
“We’re trying to focus on the right populations,” Umberg said. “I do think it will expand it, but not dramatically.”
Monica Porter Gilbert, a mental health policy advocate with Disability Rights California, said the lack of clear information from the state about how the program has been implemented thus far is a big part of the problem. 
“It feels concerning to massively open the gates to expand eligibility for the program when we really have no evidence that the program is having a positive impact,” she said.
Umberg initially wanted to expand CARE Court in a way that would have made even more people eligible for it. An earlier draft of his legislation would have included all mood disorders with psychotic features. But critics, including the County Behavioral Health Directors Association, warned that “massive expansion” would lead to people flooding into CARE Court faster than counties could provide services. As a concession, Umberg eventually limited his bill to bipolar disorder. 
Newsom’s mental health overhaul
In addition to expanding eligibility, Umberg’s bill also eliminates what he said are some “inefficiencies” from the CARE Court process. That includes combining two early court hearings into one, he said, thereby reducing the amount of time participants have to spend in court and saving administrative resources. 
The legislation also allows the criminal justice system to refer someone directly into CARE Court if they are charged with a crime and are deemed incompetent to stand trial.
Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association, said her organization opposed the new law. She worries that counties won’t have the staffing or housing resources necessary to handle an influx of people. And they are still working out kinks in a system that is still relatively new, she said. 
At the same time, she said, county behavioral health departments are also pivoting to address dozens of other new initiatives, including Newsom’s 2024 mental health housing bond known as Proposition 1 as well as CalAIM, the governor’s overhaul of Medi-Cal for mental health services.
“We need to allow counties to implement the very many things that have been put on the table,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/032923-NEWSOM-MENTAL-HEALTH-OVERHAUL-AP-AH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678
