(Getty Images)Opposition to a bill targeting “human sexuality” instruction continued Wednesday at the Indiana Statehouse, where critics argued that parents already have access to — and authority over — such coursework for their kids.
On the table before the House Education Committee, too, was legislation to further address widespread chronic absenteeism among Hoosier students.
Up first was Senate Bill 442, which requires any instruction and learning materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board. 
Basic information about the curriculum would have to be published in a “conspicuous” place on the school’s website. That includes a list of classes, by grade level, “in which any instruction concerning human sexuality will be taught,’ and whether that  instruction “will be provided by a male or female instructor.”
The school’s parental consent form — which lets parents remove their children from sexual education classes — would also need a link to that information. A grievance procedure would additionally need to be in place for parents to call out non-compliant schools.

Critics of the bill emphasized, however, that Indiana parents already have the right to remove their child from sex education classes.
Currently, school boards also have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.
“A parent can contact the teacher and say, ‘What’s the curriculum?’ And the teacher has to tell them … and then (parents) can already opt their child out of whatever education that they don’t feel is appropriate,” said Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute. “I’m wondering why we’re doing this when it already exists.”
But bill author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, questioned if school boards “are actually having conversations” about related curriculum. He reiterated Wednesday that his proposal “respects both local control and parental rights” and “just says materials used in sex ed must be approved by the local school board.” 
Byrne said the bill stems from concerns brought to him by teachers and parents and intends to “help parents better decide whether they want to opt their child out” of sex ed courses.
He gave a similar argument before the Senate education committee earlier in the session. His bill advanced from that panel — and from the full chamber — along party lines.
“We all know conversations on sex ed are more sensitive than other subjects because families have different values, different ideals, about what is appropriate to talk about and when it’s appropriate to talk to their child, or when it’s appropriate for their child to hear about it,” Byrne said.
“We don’t have any state standards for sex ed, so teachers don’t have a lot of direction,” he continued. “I didn’t want to force anything at the state level. But as a former school board member, I think putting local school boards in the driver’s seat on this issue makes good sense. They are elected by the voters, after all, so I think this is a good bill.”
More opposition against sex ed measure
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Byrne introduced a similar bill in 2024 that advanced from the Senate but died in the House without a committee hearing.










I'm wondering why we're doing this when it already exists.


– Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute


This year’s bill has some tweaks: non-public schools are excluded; and a new provision, added in the Senate education committee, updates reference to “sexually transmitted diseases” in the existing sex education statute with “sexually transmitted infections.”
The House Education Committee heard testimony on Byrne’s proposal but is not expected to take a vote until next week — just before the deadline for bills to advance from committee.
Two amendments to the bill are pending.
One offered by Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, seeks to require sex ed instruction to include a presentation on “human growth and development during pregnancy” that includes:

a “high-definition ultrasound video,” at least three minutes long, “showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other vital organs in early fetal development;” and
a “high-quality computer-generated rendering or animation” showing “the process of fertilization and each stage of fetal development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy from fertilization to birth.”

Democratic Rep. Ed DeLaney, also of Indianapolis, questioned whether lawmakers are confusing what this new term ‘human sexuality’ is.
“I think I’m in support of this particular amendment, but I’m worried about where we’re going here,” he said. “Are we opening the door here to a broad discussion of, ‘Let’s call it everything about sex except the sex act?’ That’s what’s troubling me here. … Where’s the line here as to what we can’t talk about, what we can talk about?”
DeLaney offered his own amendment to the bill to better specify what would be required of school boards and “get rid of telling the parents whether the teacher who’s going to teach the class is male or female — I find that personally offensive.”

Byrne held that parents should know information about the teacher so they can decide if their child should participate in the instruction.
“A young child or young boy … they may behave differently depending on whether it’s a male or female teacher,” he said. “And if you think about a daughter, do I want a man teaching those subjects to her?”
Democrats — along with Rep. Becky Cash, R-Zionsville — separately asked what would happen if materials, or even the class’ teacher, changed during the academic year, since the postings are due in July. Byrne replied that “locals can figure that out … they’ll be able to navigate that.”
Roughly 30 minutes of public testimony, mostly from school and teachers groups, was critical of the bill. Samantha Bresnahan, a senior policy specialist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, cautioned, for example, whether the bill would apply to a wide range of subjects beyond sex education, including literature and science classes. 
“This could create confusion about which courses need to be approved and reported on, and have a chilling effect for education on a wide range of subjects,” she told the committee.
Only Micah Clark, representing the American Family Association of Indiana, spoke in favor, saying the bill “informs parents of what will be taught on a potentially sensitive subject, and ensures that elected school board members have reviewed whatever might be taught on this topic.”
Continued support for chronic absenteeism interventions
House lawmakers additionally considered Republican Sen. Stacey Donato’s measure to beef up the state’s absenteeism statute.
Senate Bill 482 has multiple parts, including a new definition in state code for chronically absent, specified in the bill as missing 10% or more of the school year, regardless of whether it is excused.
Another provision allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken. 
Indiana officials say chronic absenteeism rates are improving, but there’s still more work ahead

A final section of the bill would prohibit K-8 students from expulsion “solely because that student is chronically absent or habitually truant,” said Donato, of Logansport. Current law permits students in those grades to be expelled for missing too much school.
The Senate measure mirrors House Bill 1201, which unanimously passed the House but has yet to get a Senate hearing. A House committee vote on Donato’s bill is likely to come next week.
Multiple school advocates who testified Wednesday supported Donato’s effort.
“This bill acknowledges that a one size fits all approach simply won’t work,” said Cindy Long, assistant executive director for the Indiana Association of School Principals. “It gives schools the tools they need to support students, engage families and take additional action when necessary, without penalizing our youngest learners for struggles beyond their control.”
Chris Lagoni, of the Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association, said his organization also backs the proposal, but recommended other language be added to the bill to address students who use school transfers “as a way to escape accountability.” 
“We’d like to really work on focusing and getting kids to school,” Lagoni said. “If they can make it to school, they can make it to work. … And (we want to) continue to look at, and make sure, that students aren’t using the opportunity to transfer to another school to escape the process of trying to improve their attendance.”

The law, named the Alabama Public Employee Paid Parental Leave Act of 2025, will go into effect on July 1.
The legislation passed the House 94-2 on March 20. The two votes against it were male representatives that claimed parents could use their accrued sick leave or “catastrophic” sick leave for parental leave. According to the Alabama State Department of Education, teachers earn one sick day per month for 10 months. 
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, a longtime supporter of paid parental leave who carried Figures’ bill in the House, said during debate on the House floor last month that it takes more than 10 days to recover from having a baby.
“Having a baby is a normal function. The catastrophic leave is for that, catastrophic and for unusual circumstances,” Shaver said in March.
The legislation does not make parental leave an accruable benefit. According to the Legislative Services Agency, the leave will cost $10,750 for parents that take eight weeks and $2,600 for those that take two weeks. 
Figures sponsored a bill last year for educators that was changed to remove male employees’ leave and leave in the case of a miscarriage and stillborn. The Senate passed the bill, but then-Senate President Pro Tem Greg Reed, R-Jasper, prevented it from being sent to the House, something any senator can do after the 26th legislative day. 
“Paid leave is an essential tool for workforce and economic growth, providing education and state employees with the opportunity to care for their newborn or newly adopted child without worrying about unnecessary financial strain,” Figures said in a statement.
According to the statement, providing paid parental leave to public employees was a recommendation included in the Final Report of the Governor’s Study Group on Efficiency in State Government as a way to increase the recruitment and retention of public employees.
“This is a proud day for Alabama families, and I want to thank Sen. Vivian Figures and Rep. Ginny Shaver for championing this effort from the very start,” Ivey said.
Shaver sponsored the House version of the bill. She echoed Ivey that the bill supports Alabama’s values.
“By providing paid parental leave for state employees and education employees, we are not only recognizing the fundamental importance of family, but also investing in the well-being and stability of our workforce,” Shaver said in a statement.

(Photo courtesy NM Forestry)National fire weather forecasters warn that most of New Mexico will face above-normal fire potential this month, and those conditions will worsen until at least until the monsoon season begins in July.
The National Interagency Fire Center issued its April wildfire outlook Tuesday, presenting a series of maps showing New Mexico with snow pack far below normal, along with severe drought and above normal average temperatures expected throughout the summer. 
Those factors combine to make the state, particularly the western two-thirds, at high risk of wildfires beginning in May, according to forecasters. 
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

So far in New Mexico this year, 222 wildfires have started, affecting 31,675 acres. Humans caused the vast majority of those fires, according to the Southwest Coordination Center. The Mogote Hill Fire near Wagon Mound, which burned an estimated 15,000 acres, ranks as the biggest New Mexico fire so far this year. 
Last week, New Mexico State Forestry released daily wildfire awareness tips, including how and when to safely burn debris. 
The above-normal wildfire potential occurs amid federal cuts to the United States Forest Service, including probationary employees who often had wildfire suppression training. 
Proposed federal lease terminations also include two New Mexico wildfire dispatch centers covering one-third of the state, though U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office recently told Source New Mexico that he had received “assurances” that the dispatch centers would stay open. 
A Heinrich spokesperson noted, however, that his office was still awaiting  official confirmation about the dispatch centers from the General Services Administration. The Heinrich spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday as to whether that official confirmation had yet arrived.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crews-work-to-secure-line-on-mogote-hill-fire_nm-forestry-division--e1742232848376.webp,,,2025-04-02 14:07:38.307298

Other components of the Lightning Plan, however, fall short in protecting public health.","Aerial shot of power plant and industrial buildings on the bank of the Allegheny River in Springdale, a town 18 miles north of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. (Courtesy of Getty Images)On January 30, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced his “Lightning Plan,” a comprehensive proposal meant to address Pennsylvania’s energy future and promote a wide array of energy projects in the Commonwealth. Elements of the plan were reflected in Shapiro’s proposed 2025-2026 budget, released in February, and are discussed in EHP’s new white paper: “Pennsylvania’s Shale Gas Boom: What the Shapiro Administration Can Do to Better Protect Public Health.”
The “Lightning Plan” proposes an “all of the above” approach to securing Pennsylvania’s energy future, parts of which may benefit the health of Pennsylvanians. Climate emissions reductions, faster approval and tax credits for renewable energy projects, and standards that incentivize the next generation of energy will all help to improve public health.
  Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks about his energy plan Wednesday, March 13, 2024, in Scranton (Commonwealth Media Services photo)
The plan also calls for rebates and incentives for consumers to buy new energy efficient appliances and other goods that reduce energy use. Energy efficiency is always a good approach – the cheapest, cleanest, and healthiest kilowatt-hour is the one not used. We applaud any steps that will support a just transition to a renewable energy economy and support jobs for the Commonwealth.
Other components of the Lightning Plan, however, fall short in protecting public health. As in the past, the Shapiro Administration continues to define “clean energy” broadly to include fossil fuels, such as shale gas. Shale gas is used as feedstock in certain hydrogen, petrochemical, and aviation fuel plants operating or proposed in Western Pennsylvania and other areas of the state. The incentives in Shapiro’s plan give these industrial complexes the ability to add to Pennsylvania’s existing pollution problems.
When it comes to energy, there must be a reckoning with how we define “clean.” Because of what we know about pervasive infrastructure leaks and climate risks associated with unburned methane, any claim that fracked gas is a realistic climate solution is patently false. Pollution from shale gas operations hastens climate change, producing more devastating storms, floods, heatwaves, fires, and insect-borne diseases – putting public health at risk for all Pennsylvanians and, indeed, for people across the globe.
Meanwhile, families who live in proximity to the vast network of gas wells, processing plants, compressor stations, pipelines, storage facilities, petrochemical operations, and other infrastructure continue to be exposed to pollution that raises the risk of health harms. Research shows associations between shale gas development and an array of health impacts, including poor birth outcomes, asthma exacerbation, heart failure and high blood pressure, stress and mental health issues, and cancer. 
At least one study also suggests that continued shale gas development has weakened, rather than strengthened, the local economy and contributed to reductions in population and jobs. Furthermore, there has historically been little to no meaningful government engagement with communities when making decisions about the infrastructure they will host, even though their residents will bear the brunt of those decisions in the form of adverse health impacts.
Ultimately there needs to be consideration for public health ramifications with any of these proposed energy actions. A major part of that consideration must be meaningful engagement with the communities hosting energy infrastructure to ensure equity in decision-making processes and to prioritize public health in places where it is most at risk.
For years, frontline residents have had little to no say in the construction of shale gas facilities in their communities – including where, how, or if it happens. In response to their concerns, they have received, at best, iterations of greenwashed lip service, most recently with CNX’s “Radical Transparency” initiative.
The Shapiro Administration must also take the lead in promoting a just transition to renewable energy. With its strong roots in manufacturing, its expertise in technology and medical research, and an existing workforce that is energy-oriented, Pennsylvania has what it takes to become a renewable energy leader, creating sustainable jobs, reducing health impacts and health care costs, and saving lives.
 Gov. Shapiro has an opportunity to show courageous leadership in a way none of his predecessors have since the beginning of the shale gas boom: by meaningfully engaging with nearby communities any time energy infrastructure is proposed and by making sure that “clean” means “safe” for the vast majority of Pennsylvanians.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Wednesday a measure banning drivers from using cellphones behind the wheel outside of hands-free or voice-activated modes.
Reynolds was joined by more than 50 people in her office Wednesday, many of whom were related to people who had died because of distracted driving. The governor recognized the names of many of the people who lost their lives due to distracted driving incidents before signing the measure into law.
“I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to their families for being here today and for their tireless advocacy,” Reynolds said. “I can’t imagine how hard it’s been to tell and to retell your stories, but your courage will save lives. So, on behalf of all the families across our great state, thank you.”
With the bill’s signing, the measure, which is an expansion from Iowa’s current law banning texting while driving, will go into effect July 1. Law enforcement officers will give warnings for violations from July through the rest of 2025. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, using handheld personal electronic devices while driving will result in a fine of $100. If the incident results in an injury, the fine is raised to $500, and incidents that cause death will raise the fine to $1,000.
The governor said that Iowa has become the 31st state in the country to have a “hands free” law on the books, and that neighboring states like Minnesota and Illinois have seen major decreases in car crashes since enacting similar laws.
“I’m grateful, because this legislation will save lives,” Reynolds said. “According to a recent study, a 10% reduction in distracted driving in Iowa will prevent over 1,200 crashes, 700 injuries and six deaths, as well as over $50 million in economic damages.”
The measure had received support from Reynolds at the beginning of the session, when she mentioned the proposal in her January Condition of the State address. Part of the governor’s push came in part after meeting the family of Roland Taylor of Terril — a victim of a distracted driving crash in 2023. The governor said she signed the measure into law, nearly two years to the day of the crash “in his memory, and we’d do the same for every Iowan killed due to distracted driving.”
Angie Smith, the daughter of Taylor, said she and her family met Reynolds at the Clay County Fair in 2024 and talked to her about her father’s death.
“My mom stated to the governor, ‘We need to do something about a handsfree bill,’ and it caught her attention, and it was very emotional for the governor also,” Smith said. “So (she) reached out to us and has been pushing and supporting ever since.”
Smith said “there’s not a better way that we could have honored dad today,” saying Taylor would have been proud to see the law being signed and save lives.
“When the governor called me personally last week and said … that it was passed, I just broke down in tears,” Smith said. “And I called mom immediately, so happy to just know that this is going to save someone else’s life, hopefully that these families will not have to go through this.”
Senate File 22 was an effort that advocates have pushed lawmakers to pass for almost seven years. While in previous sessions the measure failed in the Iowa House, the chamber passed the 2025 bill in a 84-11 vote in late March.
Peter Bengtson, the father of Ellen Bengtson, who was killed by a distracted driver while biking in 2020, said that the years of the bill failing to advance felt like a “kick to the gut,” but that the law being signed Wednesday was a “good first step” toward preventing distracted driving deaths. He said the law will allow law enforcement officers to start educating and informing people about the dangers of using phones while driving, and is an important start in stopping preventable deaths on Iowa roads.
“This is an experience you don’t want to have,” Bengtson said. “You don’t want to be on the side of the situation where you lose a loved one, and I can’t imagine you want to be the person behind the wheel who knew that you made a bad choice and you killed other people or maimed them. …This is an epidemic beyond compare for public safety.

FAU’s trustees in February picked a new president: Adam Hasner, a former GOP state lawmaker and executive of a for-profit prison group that manages 16 ICE detention centers across the country.
Hasner served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2002 to 2010, taking the role of House majority leader during his last three years in the chamber. Between 2016 and his appointment at FAU, he was executive vice president for public policy at the GEO Group, where he oversaw 60 consultants representing the company’s interests in D.C., according to his resume.
The $4 billion company’s stock value doubled after Election Day, according to ProPublica.
Following a two-year-long presidential search, FAU’s trustees picked and the state university system’s Board of Governors confirmed Hasner as the new president, with a base salary of $875,000 and a potential performance bonus of $150,000, according to his contract.
“When I step onto this campus, if I were to be the eighth president of this university, my commitment to you, sir, and my commitment to this board and my commitment to this entire university community is that I am not involved in partisan politics,” Hasner told trustees during the Feb. 10 meeting when they picked him. “I do not believe that it is politically red or politically blue to be a university president.”

‘Incredibly concerning’ and ‘unbelieveable’
The university of more than 31,000 students describes itself as a Hispanic-serving institution and the number-one Florida public university in terms of campus ethnic diversity.
Details of the paperwork FAU submitted to ICE, such as the number of officers it intends to deputize, have not been published.
Paula Muñoz, executive director of Florida Student Power Network, said that, considering Hasner’s background with GEO Group, she wasn’t surprised FAPD could be the first campus department to deputize its officers to act as immigration enforcement agents, which requires them to undergo a 40-hour online training.
“It’s incredibly concerning. It’s something that should not be a part of the education or institutions,” Muñoz said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “They should be worried about how to make sure that students are feeling safe on campus.”
The pending agreement raised concerns for FAU junior Nicholas Ostheimer in light of the detention of nearly a dozen students and faculty across the country. He led the student protests against Hasner’s selection as president.
“It’s unbelievable and it’s an insult to our community and an attack on our freedoms,” Ostheimer told the Phoenix.
Push for as many ICE agreements as possible
Meanwhile, the DeSantis administration is pushing for cities and counties to enter into the agreements that the governor has characterized as the maximum level of collaboration and has said will lead to street-level enforcement. So far, Florida cities, counties, and state agencies have entered into 194 agreements with ICE, although some of the agreements are aimed at apprehending people without legal status already in jails and prisons.
In early March, the chief of Pinellas County Schools Police signed and submitted paperwork to enter into the task force model agreement with ICE without the knowledge or authorization of the school board and superintendent, which he later told the board he had done because he thought he had to comply.
The school district didn’t know about the agreement until the Phoenix contacted a spokesperson for comment.
FAU and ICE didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A new team in North Carolina Auditor Dave Boliek’s office would examine state agencies’ spending and job openings under a Republican-led bill.
The proposal, Senate Bill 474, contains echoes of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or “DOGE” — the White House team led by Elon Musk that has eliminated wide swaths of the federal bureaucracy. But it would not have the power to solely cut jobs or spending — rather, it would send a report to legislators by the end of the year recommending any offices or jobs that should be dissolved.
The auditor’s new team — sporting an acronym of DAVE — would be allowed to use A.I. “and other appropriate tools” to look at state spending. Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), the bill’s main sponsor, said it would allow his office to look at whether taxpayer dollars and resources “are effectively deployed.”
Boliek, a Republican who was elected in November after defeating former Democratic Auditor Jessica Holmes, argues that the bill just affirms authority that his office already has — just with more resources. And it “lends credibility” to North Carolina’s governance, he said.
“This bill really formalizes the work that needs to be done,” Boliek told senators on the new Regulatory Reform Committee Wednesday. That work needs to be “based on data, not emotion,” he added.

Democratic lawmakers expressed wide-ranging concerns with the legislation. They said the bill risked politicizing a process that should be focused on objective measures, could use A.I. in a non-transparent way and could result in an even slimmer state workforce that many say is understaffed and that’s already struggling to fill vacancies.
“Behind every one of these jobs, we have a reason, a community, a team,” said Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham), who called the bill, and Musk’s DOGE, “job destroyers.”
Boliek pledged that his office would act in a nonpartisan way if the bill became law. And he acknowledged concerns with A.I., but said it was a good test case for its use in government.
“The fact is, we’ve got to start somewhere in the state of North Carolina using A.I.,” Boliek said. “Because it’s coming. There’s no better place than the state auditor’s office to get started with that.”

Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employees Association of North Carolina, said there was “genuine concern” among state workers.
“(This bill) presupposes that a conversation of government efficiency is about employee efficiency,” said Watkins, suggesting that lawmakers instead scrutinize contracts that spend taxpayer dollars.
North Carolina government has about 14,000 total vacancies, according to state officials. The head of the government’s HR office has said it can take six months to fill a single role; and lawmakers say they continue to hear complaints that wages are too low.

(Photos courtesy NMDOH)The New Mexico health department on Wednesday said obesity rates for third graders decreased for the fourth consecutive year.
The report from NMDOH’s Obesity, Nutrition and Physical Activity Program uses data from 40 schools across 21 counties, and assessed close to 2,950 students, according to a news release, which also noted that participation in the data collection is voluntary.

a decline in the past year in obesity rates for kindergarten students from 18.2% to 17.3%
a decline in obesity rates for third graders in the same time period from 27.5% to 24.1%
Boys’ obesity rates were 6.5% higher than girls.
Ongoing highest obesity prevalence among American Indian students at 27.6% of students

“We collect and analyze obesity data so we can invest our resources in areas that lack infrastructure for safe physical activity and opportunities to buy affordable healthy food,” Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “Obesity in children highlights inequities in our community infrastructure and access to resources.”
According to the report, department’s childhood obesity surveillance program — established in 2010 — uses “body mass index (BMI) percentile and a standardized measurement protocol to monitor childhood obesity over time, identify at-risk groups, guide state and local prevention efforts, and inform appropriate resource allocation.”
Despite the improvements, the report notes that obesity remains a significant problem in New Mexico, particularly for children, with obesity increasing significantly between kindergarten and third grade.
“Childhood obesity is a complex issue that is influenced by weight bias, socioeconomic status, food insecurity and community infrastructure,” the report said, noting that in 2023, close to one-in-four (24.7%) school-aged children in New Mexico lived in poverty, compared to nearly one-in-six (15.7%) nationally in 2023. That makes “New Mexican children more at risk for obesity than children in other states,” the report said, and children with obesity are more likely to develop: high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, sleep apnea and depression.
The health department program says part of its strategy to combat childhood obesity includes programs in seven counties and one Tribal community to expand activities such as farm-to-school food programs, exercise activities and nutrition programs.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved legislation to make it a crime to interfere with first responders working a scene after the sponsor removed language that critics said violated free speech rights.
HB 224, sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, makes it a misdemeanor to loiter within 25 feet of a first responder after getting told to leave the scene or to interfere with either paramedics or law enforcement who were dispatched to the area.
“We are seeing more and more of this,” Treadaway told the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. “Since I left four years ago a lot of this, when I was policing, we did not see.”

As originally filed, the bill included language that potentially criminalized people for verbally harassing or directing abusive language at first responders.
A substitute that Treadaway filed removed that section and required first responders to instruct people not to approach or leave the scene. If they refuse or return after they are told to leave, and remain within 25 feet of the first responder, they are then subject to arrest if they interfere with first responders while they are working a scene, or if they threaten them.
Those who violate the provisions in the bill are subject to a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
The radius for the crime was originally 100 feet. The substitute changed it to 25 feet. The original version also stated that those who loiter within 25 feet of a first responder after they were told to leave and interfere in the situation or make disparaging verbal comments or abusive language could then be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. The language was removed.
The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee considered the legislation after the committee hosted a public hearing in March prior to the spring recess.
Some still had concerns with the limit pertaining to distance.
“Is there anything that is going to tell the community that they are going to have to stay back 25 feet?” asked Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery.
Treadaway said that officers are trained to move a crowd back from a scene further than 25 feet and make it clear they cannot move any closer.
“We have this whole court system in our country that allows redress,” Treadaway said.
He said that individuals can use the court system to challenge the actions of law enforcement.
“If the officer is doing his job, he is videotaping everything, he is not going to put someone in jail that he has got to go before a judge,” Treadaway said. “We have this whole court system in this country that allows redress, so if you feel like you want to challenge it, just like a ticket, that is what we have a court for. Either you can pay for your ticket, or you can argue your case. An officer feels the same way.”
The bill moves to the full House.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will surge FBI assets across the country to address unresolved violent crimes in areas with high Native American populations, including crimes related to missing and murdered Indigenous people.
The FBI will send 60 personnel, rotating in 90-day temporary duty assignments over a six-month period. A news release described the effort as “Operation Not Forgotten” and said it will be “the longest and most intense national deployment of FBI resources to address Indian Country crime to date.”
Justice disparities on South Dakota reservations need attention, US attorney general says

FBI personnel will support field offices in Albuquerque; Denver; Detroit; Jackson, Mississippi; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Salt Lake City. The FBI will work in partnership with other federal and tribal law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions, the Justice Department said, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit.
The territory of the FBI’s Minneapolis office includes South Dakota. The U.S. attorney for the state, Alison Ramsdell, said in the news release that “these additional resources will aid in our effort to hold offenders accountable and achieve justice on behalf of victims.”
At the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the FBI’s Indian Country program had approximately 4,300 open investigations, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the news release.
“Crime rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are unacceptably high,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the release. “By surging FBI resources and collaborating closely with U.S. attorneys and tribal law enforcement to prosecute cases, the Department of Justice will help deliver the accountability that these communities deserve.”
FBI director Kash Patel said in the news release that “the FBI will manhunt violent criminals on all lands” and also “find those who have gone missing.”

The number of firearm deaths among children and teens in the United States have jumped 50% since 2019. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A significant majority of North Carolina residents oppose laws that would allow people to carry concealed handguns without a permit, according to polls released in recent days by Elon University and the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.
Though it was conducted several months ago, the Everytown for Gun Safety survey, released Wednesday, found that a large majority of likely North Carolina voters (77%) were against removing permit requirements from concealed carry laws.
Global Strategy Group conducted a survey of 800 likely voters in North Carolina between September 4 and September 9, 2024 for Everytown for Gun Safety. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.
The Elon University poll, released last Thursday, found that 54% of respondents opposed dropping the concealed carry permit while only 34% support such a change.
The Elon poll was conducted March 3 through 11, 2025, with a sample of 800 North Carolina adults and a margin of error of +/- 4.04%.
Poll director Prof. Jason Husser told NC Newsline he found it particularly noteworthy that a large percentage of Republicans had concerns about permitless carry and that less than half (48%) favor removing the requirement. While he noted that the survey did not explore the question in depth, Husser opined that “many of the Republicans who have these permits feel like it was not that invasive or intrusive to have the process — they already went through it, and don’t really see a need to change it.”
The analyses come as state legislators are debating Senate Bill 50 and House Bill 5, two measures aiming to enact what supporters call “constitutional carry” — the idea that individuals should be able to carry concealed weapons without permits due to their Second Amendment rights.
Current North Carolina law requires individuals to obtain a permit from their local sheriff’s office and undergo an eight-hour training course in order to carry a concealed firearm.
In addition to the bulk of North Carolinians opposing permitless carry, the Everytown polling found that 66% of gun owners did as well.
85% of women are against permitless carry, as are 66% of men, the Everytown survey found.
There was a similar trend when considering political party. 96% of Democrats, 77% of independents, and 60% of Republicans oppose permitless carry, according to the Everytown poll.
In each category surveyed across partisan, gender, racial, and education groups, more people were against permitless carry than in support.
“The data couldn’t be clearer — North Carolinians don’t want to live in a state where untrained, potentially dangerous individuals can carry hidden guns in our communities. This isn’t just a policy issue; it’s a matter of public safety,” said Wendy Brooks, a volunteer with the North Carolina chapter of Moms Demand Action, Everytown Survivor Fellow, and gun owner.
At the North Carolina state legislature, Senate Bill 50 passed the Senate on March 20 and is now in the House, while House Bill 5 awaits approval from another committee in the lower chamber.
On Tuesday, the House Judiciary 2 Committee approved House Bill 193, a measure that would allow handguns in private schools.
“If North Carolina lawmakers truly want to represent their constituents, including gun owners and Republicans, they should reject this reckless attempt to dismantle the concealed carry permitting system and instead focus on real solutions that will keep communities safe,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gun-deaths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-04-02 13:09:31.233605

U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, in a news release issued Tuesday, cited Martin’s actions since being named interim U.S. attorney as the reason for the hold.
“For the past nine weeks, Ed Martin has consistently undermined the independence and abused the power of the U.S. Attorney’s office in DC – openly threatening and intimidating political opponents, dismissing charges against his own clients, firing public servants for their roles in legitimate investigations, and using his office as a cudgel to chill dissent and free speech,” Schiff said. “No one embodies Donald Trump’s personal weaponization of the Justice Department more than Ed Martin.”
Martin did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday morning.
Martin, who grew up in New Jersey, has spent most of his adult life in Missouri since attending St. Louis University Law School. After almost two years as chief of staff to Gov. Matt Blunt from January 2006 to November 2007, Martin twice ran unsuccessfully for office.
Martin sought the Third District seat in Congress in 2010 and was the Republican nominee for Missouri attorney general in 2012.
Martin was originally tapped by President Donald Trump to run the Office of Management and Budget. But in January, Trump shifted Martin to the D.C. prosecutor’s office.
Martin, who resigned in January after 10 years as president of Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, worked as a defense attorney for people charged with crimes for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Since taking office in an interim appointment Jan. 22, Martin has drawn criticism from Democrats who accuse him of making political decisions about prosecutions.
In early March, 10 senate Democrats complained about Martin to the D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The complaint said he had dismissed criminal charges against his own clients and threatened  prosecution against government employees to intimidate them, the Hill reported.
In a news release, Schiff said he was blocking Martin’s nomination because of his “troubling conduct in his months as Interim U.S. Attorney in the same role.”
The nomination must get passed the Senate Judiciary Committee before going to the Senate for confirmation. 
“For the past few weeks, Ed Martin has been a one-man wrecking ball,” Schiff wrote Tuesday on social media. “Threatening political opponents, firing public servants, and using his office to chill free speech. His nomination must be blocked.”

Andy Beshear is taking the Kentucky legislature to court over a new law that limits the executive branch's authority to enact regulations. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has gone to court to block what the lawsuit calls the “latest power grab” by the GOP-controlled legislature.
At issue is a new law that curbs the executive branch’s authority to make regulations. The bill was a priority for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity which is pushing the measure in multiple states and the U.S. Congress.
In a complaint filed in Franklin Circuit Court on March 28, attorneys for the Office of the Governor and the Public Protection Cabinet wrote House Bill 6  is unconstitutional because it essentially hands over control of a state executive branch function and power — issuing and implementing regulations — to the legislature. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs write the debate over HB 6 on the House floor “clearly shows the legislative branch is intentionally violating the strict separation of powers” in the Kentucky Constitution. Attorneys pointed to comments made by Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, on the House floor last month in which Roberts said “they better ask us for permission before they engage in executive branch lawmaking.” 
Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd held a hearing on the case Wednesday morning to consider the plaintiffs’ request to temporarily block the law. The Lantern has not yet confirmed whether the plaintiffs’ request was granted or denied Wednesday.
A request for comment sent to a spokesperson for Republicans in the Kentucky House of Representatives was not immediately returned. 
The Republican-controlled legislature passed HB 6, dubbed the REINS Act or Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, over a veto by Beshear in the final days of this year’s legislative session. The legislation went into immediate effect on March 27 because of the bill’s emergency clause.
HB 6, primarily sponsored by Rep. Wade Williams, R-Madisonville, would prevent executive branch agencies from filing, amending  or repealing regulations unless the regulations meet one of six prerequisites. Wade in a previous statement touted the bill as a way to put “common sense boundaries on the regulatory powers of unelected government employees.”
Those prerequisites include that the regulation will not cost more than $500,000 over two years to implement; is needed immediately to “to meet an imminent threat” to public health, safety, or welfare; is needed to prevent the loss of funds or meet a deadline established in laws or regulations; or is needed relating to the licensure of health facilities and services. 
The lawsuit names Emily Caudill, the regulations compiler for the Legislative Research Commission, as the defendant. Attorneys for the governor wrote HB 6 gives Caudill the power to determine whether regulations can be filed including when the legislature is not in session. 
The governor also says HB 6 restrictions could prevent the implementation of laws passed by the legislature this year, such as  creation of a Parkinson’s Disease registry that state officials estimate could have an upfront cost of at least $635,000. Another law that the complaint states could be impacted is a move to license retailers who sell nicotine which has regulatory costs that could reach into the millions of dollars, exceeding the limits in HB 6.
The passage of HB 6 was applauded by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity-Kentucky (AFP-KY), a part of a network of political groups affiliated with businessmen Charles Koch and the late David Koch.
AFP-KY State Director Heather LeMire said in a statement that while the governor can “grandstand,” his lawsuit claims are off base. 
“If the governor or his administration had read the law, they would know that it has a stipulation for regulations that come out of legislation for the executive branch to promulgate these regulations, as well as a generous stipulation for the governor’s emergency powers,” LeMire said. “It is clear that Governor Beshear wants to avoid accountability and make policy, but that is the job of the legislature. If he is set on being a policymaker, we welcome his resignation so he can run for the General Assembly in November of 2026.”
She said the legislature gives the governor the power to issue regulations through a specific chapter of state law.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0351-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 13:09:31.233605

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Seven years ago, we were in a tight spot. 
My wife, daughters, and I were sharing a house in central New Hampshire with my parents, and even that frugal living arrangement wasn’t enough to make it affordable for any of us after a while. The property taxes were too high and climbing (even in our tight-fisted red town), the cost of upkeep became prohibitive, and there were too many years of paychecks going in the wrong direction. Amid that tense mess, my dad passed away — of course it was his heart — and my sister and her family ended up selling their place next door and taking over the old house, in part so my mom could stay. We all agreed it was the best option of the few available to our extended clan. Meanwhile, the four of us — the family within the family — found a starter home we felt like we could afford and began again in a new town with new schools for the girls. It wasn’t the softest landing, for any of us.
We were unmoored. 
The first year in that new life was tough, and we almost lost everything. My wife and I were both working full time but carrying a lot of credit card debt. The minimum payments combined with the mortgage, utilities, and other standard living expenses left us with nothing at the end of the month. If you didn’t know us, if you weren’t there, it would be as good a guess as any that the debt was a result of us living beyond our means. After all, every family has to live within a budget, and every family needs to learn how to trim the fat.
The thing is, there wasn’t any. The thousands in debt wasn’t the result of vacations; we never took any. It wasn’t for nights on the town or Amazon splurges. It is just how much extra it cost, added up over the first 15 years of our life together, to keep a young family of four afloat in New Hampshire. It was for urgent home and car repairs that we didn’t see coming, school clothes and supplies for the girls, all of those incidental bills that turn ledgers red.
In the end, we felt our only option — after exploring all of them — was to do precisely what the experts say you should not do: We cashed out part of my 401(k) to pay off the debt. For us, the choice amounted to sink now or struggle later. In other words, there was no choice at all.  
I’m sharing all of these personal details, and uncomfortably so, not because I think my family’s story is unique but because in most ways it isn’t. In America, it is so very expensive to have nothing. And that is why political debate in this country strikes me as a kind of madness. We have created a system that exerts endless economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and the big myth is that whoever you perceive to be below you on that class ladder is the primary, and undeserving, beneficiary of your hard work, your taxes, your struggle. But they are not. And I have to believe — or at least hope — that all of you will see that one day, whatever political party you support.
The whole of the American political establishment — long owned by the actual beneficiaries of that downward economic pressure — serves as the architect for the grand illusion. But the American right takes the cake — has long taken the cake — for subterfuge and misdirection, and it’s a bitter bite. 
In this state, they say:
Don’t ask about the $1.17 billion in lost tax revenue for New Hampshire due to all those ill-advised business tax cuts. The real problem is the transgender women and girls entering our public bathrooms and playing on our school soccer fields.
How can you talk about the N.H. GOP’s repeal of the interest and dividends tax in service to the rich, and the loss of another $150 million-plus toward public services, when we are so clearly under attack by murderous migrants?
Sure, your property taxes are high and getting higher, but don’t blame New Hampshire’s aversion to progressive taxation. The problem, you see, is that school districts are spending all of your hard-earned money on smut and critical race theory lessons.
Speaking of schools, pay no mind to how the Republican voucher program is diverting public money to private and religious schools, amid questionable transparency, and adding to the struggles of our beleaguered public schools. But do you know what you should worry about? People who have very little — those ne’er-do-wells enrolled in Medicaid and SNAP — taking advantage of the system. That’s a much bigger deal than billionaires like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg endlessly profiting from a system largely built by and for people just like them.
And don’t worry: Those forever-do-wells will totally have your back once the IRS is too gutted to come after them, environmental regulations no longer stand in the way of their manifest destiny, and the rich-guy tax cuts are extended. The first drops of that multiplied wealth in the top 1 percent might not trickle down to the rest in this lifetime, but just you wait. I mean, if you can’t trust a billionaire and his economic enablers, who can you?
In the years since my wife and I tapped our future to salvage our present, we have never regretted the decision. We’re still here, after all. But the pressure points never go away, and new ones are added. There will be a reckoning when we retire, if we can retire, and the debt pattern is repeating with our daughters through no fault of their own. We worry, constantly, about college costs (even for in-state tuition), the extremely high price of housing, and the direction of a state whose political majority chases every trumped up political issue that comes down the pike while avoiding or worsening the ones that really matter.
As I said, there is nothing particularly unique about our story, except maybe for one thing: We were lucky. Crazy lucky. We’re still standing because we had a small retirement plan to tap, but one little thing could have sent us reeling again in a heartbeat — a lost job, a health issue, even a major home repair would have done it. Would still do it. And now, with state and federal cuts to services underway, I know that a lot of people just like us are about to feel the crushing weight of that final straw.
Why is it so hard to get by when you’ve done everything right, or tried anyway? Shouldn’t paying the bills be a little easier, just a little bit, in the richest country in the world?
If those questions don’t form the immovable center of our politics, I have no idea what it is we are doing.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/grandillusion-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

Just ask organizers of this year’s 401Gives online fundraising event, which has already shattered its previous record and hit its $4 million goal six hours ahead of deadline, United Way of Rhode Island announced Wednesday morning. 
Now in its sixth year, the 36-hour event aims to leverage collective and coordinated fundraising to help Rhode Island’s nonprofits. As of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, with six-and-a-half hours until the 6 p.m. end of the event, nearly 17,000 donors had contributed to one or more of the 640 participating nonprofits, according to the online fundraising dashboard. That’s a $300,000 increase over the $3.7 million collected during the 2024 401Gives event, and $1.14 million more than had been received at this time a year ago, according to United Way.
“We’ve surpassed our goal and are still raising the bar,” Cortney Nicolato, United Way’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “Rhode Islanders have come out in full force to support their local nonprofits and to get behind the causes that are important to them. We go into every 401Gives with extreme optimism, and right now we’re seeing a level of giving that’s simply incredible. I can’t wait to see where we finish later today.”
The record breaking amount of fundraising and participation — from donors and nonprofit beneficiaries — comes as nonprofits nationwide continue to scramble to keep services running and employees paid amid federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. 
Michael Cerio, a United Way spokesperson, attributed the record-level generosity of Rhode Islanders directly to the uncertainty that federal policies have created for nonprofits.
Over 90 participating nonprofits have raised at least $10,000 apiece since the fundraiser began Monday morning. The 640 beneficiaries include 129 first-time participants, according to United Way. Rhode Island Current is among the returning nonprofits raising money through the 2025 event.
Foster Forward, which has led fundraising among nonprofit recipients for several years, continues to lead the charts in donations received, with nearly $335,000 from 350 donors as of midday. The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center in Newport and the Audubon Society of Rhode Island rounded out the top three, with $150,800 and $103,00 raised, respectively. The Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education led in the number of donations, with 474 donors just before noon Wednesday.
The 36-hour event continues through 6 p.m. Wednesday. To donate, and for more information, visit www.401gives.org.

(SHAWN THEW/EPA/BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY IMAGES)Five years ago, the CEO of one of the largest pain clinic companies in the Southeast was sentenced to more than three years in prison after being convicted in a $4 million illegal kickback scheme.
But after just four months behind bars, John Estin Davis walked free. President Donald Trump commuted Davis’ sentence in the last days of his first term. In a statement explaining the decision, the White House said that “no one suffered financially” from Davis’ crime.
In court, however, the Trump administration was saying something very different. As the president let him go, the Department of Justice alleged in a civil lawsuit that Davis and his company defrauded taxpayers out of tens of millions of dollars with excessive urine drug testing. The DOJ alleged that Comprehensive Pain Specialists made such a “staggering” sum from cups of pee that employees had given the testing a profit-minded nickname: “liquid gold.”
Davis and the company denied all allegations in court filings and settled the DOJ’s fraud lawsuit without any determination of liability. Davis declined to comment for this article.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has said he will target fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and his Republican allies in Congress have made combating fraud a key argument in their plans to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides health care for millions of low-income and disabled Americans. During an address to Congress last month, Trump said his administration had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” without citing any specific examples of fraud.
“Taken back a lot of that money,” Trump said. “We got it just in time.”
But Trump’s history of showing leniency to convicted fraudsters contrasts with his present-day crackdown. In his first and second terms, Trump has granted pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes or of interfering with fraud investigations, according to a KFF Health News review of court and clemency records, DOJ press releases, and news reports. At least 13 of those fraudsters were convicted in cases involving more than $1.6 billion of fraudulent claims filed with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Department of Justice.
  John Estin Davis, former CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists, who was convicted of health care fraud, was granted clemency by President Donald Trump in 2021. At the same time, the Department of Justice was suing Davis for allegedly orchestrating a much larger health care fraud scheme. Davis and CPS later settled the lawsuit without any admission of wrongdoing. (Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
And as one of the first actions of his second term, Trump fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government.
“It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,” said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney and law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.”
Elberg said considerable fraud in Medicare and Medicaid exists largely because the programs’ “pay-and-chase models” prioritize paying for patient care first and tracking down stolen dollars second. To prevent more fraud, the programs would likely need to be redesigned in ways that would be slower and more cumbersome for all patients, Elberg said.
Regardless, Elberg said the president’s claimed focus on fraud appears to be a pretext for slashing spending that has been legally appropriated by Congress. Trump has empowered the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which he established and named by executive order, to make deep cuts in federal budgets, halting some medical research and aid programs in addition to cutting spending on climate change, transgender health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
“What’s been the focal point to date of the administration is not what anybody has ever referred to as health care fraud,” Elberg said. “There is a real blurring — a seemingly intentional blurring — between what is actually fraud and what is just spending that they are not in favor of.”
Jerry Martin, who served as a U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee under President Barack Obama and now represents health care fraud whistleblowers, also said Trump’s focus on fraud appeared to be “just a platform to attack things that they don’t agree with” rather than “a genuine desire to root out and combat fraud.”
Even so, Martin said some of his whistleblower clients have been emboldened.
“I’ve had clients repeat back to me ‘President Trump says fraud is a priority,’” Martin said. “People are listening to it. But I don’t know that what he’s saying translates into what they believe.”
The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
A billion-follar fraud case and needless eye injections
Presidents enjoy the unique authority to erase federal convictions and prison sentences with pardons and commutations. In theory, the power is intended to be a final bulwark against injustice or overly harsh punishment. But many presidents have been accused of using the pardon power to reward powerful allies and close associates as they leave the White House.
Trump issued about 190 pardons and commutations in the final two months of his first term, including for some health care fraudsters convicted of schemes with astonishing costs.
For example, Trump granted a commutation to Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted in 2019 of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. After he was sentenced, DOJ announced in a press release that “the man behind one of the biggest health care frauds in history will be spending 20 years in prison.” Trump freed him 14 months later.
Trump also granted a commutation to Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who was serving a 17-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million. Melgen falsely diagnosed patients with eye diseases, then gave them unnecessary care, including laser treatments and painful eye injections, according to DOJ and court documents.
“Salomon Melgen callously took advantage of patients who came to him fearing blindness,” said a DOJ news release after Melgen was sentenced in 2018. “They received medically unreasonable and unnecessary tests and procedures that victimized his patients and the American taxpayer.”
DOJ: $70 Million Spent on ‘Excessive’ Urine Testing
Despite the flurry of pardons and commutations at the end of Trump’s first term, the leniency he showed Davis was unique. Davis was the only convicted health care fraudster to receive clemency while the Trump administration was simultaneously accusing him of more fraud.
As CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists from 2011 to 2017, Davis oversaw a rapid expansion to more than 60 locations across 12 states, according to federal court documents.
He was indicted in 2018 for using his CEO position to refer Medicare patients in need of medical equipment to a conspirator in return for kickbacks paid through a shell company, according to court documents. He was convicted at trial in April 2019 of defrauding Medicare.
Three months later, the DOJ filed a fraud lawsuit against Davis and CPS that piggybacked on the claims of seven whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that CPS collected more than $70 million from federal insurance programs for urine drug testing, most of which was “excessive,” and that an audit of a sampling of the tests had found at least 93% “lacked medical necessity.”
  A urine sample is displayed at the Comprehensive Pain Specialists laboratory in 2017. The Department of Justice has alleged in a fraud lawsuit that samples like this one were tested excessively, sometimes up to 51 times. CPS denied all allegations and settled the lawsuit without admitting any liability. (Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
Typically, government insurance programs pay for urine testing so pain clinics can verify that patients are taking their prescriptions properly and not abusing any other drugs, which could contribute to an overdose. Patients could be tested as little as once a year or as often as monthly depending on their level of risk, according to the DOJ lawsuit.
But Comprehensive Pain Specialists performed “myriad urine drug testing on virtually every CPS patient on virtually every visit” then conducted “at least 16 different types of tests” on each sample, and sometimes as many as 51, according to the lawsuit.
Trump commuted Davis’ sentence for his criminal conviction in January 2021 as the DOJ was finalizing a settlement in the civil lawsuit. The commutation was supported by country music star Luke Bryan, according to a White House statement.
Months later, with President Joe Biden in office, CPS and its owners agreed to repay $4.1 million — less than 10% of the damages sought in the suit — and the case was closed.
In the settlement, Davis agreed not to take any job where he would ever again bill Medicare or other federal health care programs. He was not required to personally repay anything.
Martin, who represented one of the whistleblowers who first raised allegations against Davis and CPS, said the leniency that Trump showed to him and other health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations during his second term.
“There are a lot of rank-and-file people who are operating at the lowest point in their professional careers, where they’ve seen a lot of their work essentially be water under the bridge,” Martin said. “That’s got to be really demoralizing.”

(Photo courtesy of David Hinckley)Party leadership of the centrist United Utah Party announced on Wednesday they have plans to merge with the Utah Forward Party. 
They announced in a news release issued Wednesday morning that a formal agreement for the merger will be presented at a joint organizing convention later this month, scheduled for April 26. 
Party leaders say the move would be “unprecedented.”
“If consummated, it is believed to be the first ever merger of political parties in the state of Utah,” the release stated. 
The announcement comes less than a month after a Republican state senator, Sen. Dan Thatcher, of West Valley City, unaffiliated with the GOP and instead joined the Utah Forward Party — a centrist party that has the slogan “Not left. Not right. Forward.”

Party leadership said “discussions about a possible merger have been taking place for many months and have been recently accelerated, building on the momentum of the news” that Thatcher was switching parties. 
“Since 2017 the UUP has been a home to disenfranchised voters and candidates who bravely opted out of an obviously dysfunctional two-party system,” said Utah Forward Party Chair Adam Teuscher. “They’ve worked tirelessly to give voters a quality third option. They believe that electeds should put the interests of their constituents over those of party bosses. Forward stands for the same, but we do so as part of a 50-state movement.”
While Teuscher said the United Utah Party “blazed this path,” through the merger, “we hope to widen it.” 
United Utah Party Chair Ladd Johnson also applauded the merger as a strategic move to further the centrist movement. 
“The United Utah Party’s long-term vision has always been to start locally and build-up a grass-roots political movement in Utah before eventually joining together with similar movements from other states,” Johnson said. “The proposed merger with the Forward Party is an important and exciting step in furthering that vision.”
Johnson added that the United Utah Party’s membership will bring “the experience, excellent platform and approach, and dedicated leaders” to combine “with the talent, energy and national presence of the Forward Party.” 
According to state voter registration statistics, the United Utah Party had about 2,210 active registered party members as of Monday, while the Utah Forward Party had 200. That’s compared to 933,827 members of the Republican Party, which dominates much of the state, and 241,633 Democrats.

Johnson told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Wednesday morning that even though the United Utah Party currently has more local members than the Utah Forward Party, the merger is proposed to join a growing national movement. 
“When (the Forward Party) formed in Utah, we didn’t join them immediately, and we were sort of just checking in and seeing how things are going, but we’ve worked closely with them,” Johnson said, adding that the two parties co-hosted candidate events during the 2024 election. “As they continue to grow nationally, we just felt the timing is really good. Let’s do this. We feel like it’s an hour of need for our country, and so we’re excited to be part of a bigger movement.” 
Johnson added that “we’ll still keep all of our Utah values and policies and hard work here, but now we can more easily speak to national matters as well.” 
While the United Utah and Forward Party’s registration numbers are small compared to the GOP, Johnson also noted that because the Utah Republican Party holds closed primaries, there are potentially thousands of Utahns who believe in their more moderate platform but don’t register so they can still weigh in on Republican primaries. 
“We’ve got tens of thousands of supporters who don’t register with us because they want to vote in the Republican primary, and we’re fine with that,” Johnson said. 
He pointed to United Utah candidate Michelle Quist’s bid for attorney general last year. In that race, Quist got 7.16% of the vote, equal to 103,831 votes. Republican Derek Brown won with 57.8%, with 838,445 votes. 
“So we’ve got a lot of support out there, but it’s never going to show up in registered party members until we get rid of the closed primaries,” Johnson said. 
Utah independents fell short this election. Will the movement fizzle — or grow? 

The decision to merge — or not — ultimately falls to party members, however. During the organizing convention on April 26, members will vote on whether to execute a memorandum of understanding. 
According to the terms of the MOU, a combined interim executive committee would be appointed from existing party leadership to oversee the merger process in accordance with state law. 
Johnson said United Utah party leadership have “taken the temperature” of party members’ appetite for the merger, and “everyone that I’ve talked to is very enthusiastic about it,” though he acknowledged it’s somewhat “bittersweet.” 
“There’s been a lot of blood, sweat and tears put into this party to get it up and running and keep it running,” Johnson said. “So it’s kind of like a founder selling his business. It feels a little bittersweet, maybe to some people. But my expectation is that the members will support it, just based on the anecdotal conversations I’ve had.” 
Johnson added that Utah’s third-party members and candidates are now “just really excited that we’ll have a bigger platform to attract more folks to be able to work with us.” 
In their efforts to shake up a two-party system, Johnson said over the years Utahns have told him, “We really like what you’re doing, (but) it would be great to be part of a national movement.” 
“So for those people who maybe haven’t joined us yet, this may be the item that brings them on board officially,” he said. 
Party leadership encouraged Utahns to get involved ahead of the state organizing convention.
“While voting to approve the merger will be limited to those who were legacy party members prior to the date of this announcement, the public is invited to attend,” the parties said in the news release. “We welcome all Utahns broadly interested in election reform and the independent political space.”

enables us to continue to deliver the highest quality of care to our patients.” Cigna, in turn, had alleged that Bon Secours wanted a rate increase equaling 30% over five years, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
The dispute had been dragging on since August of 2024, fueling concern from patients insured through Cigna as they watched and wondered if they would still be able to see their preferred provider at Bon Secours facilities should negotiations fail.
But a state law enacted in 2024 allows health care providers to continue treating patients at least 90 days after the provider disconnects from the insurer’s network. Pregnant people can continue receiving care during the postpartum period, under this measure. Patients with a life-threatening condition may receive up to 180 days of care after their provider goes out-of-network, and people being treated at in-patient facilities may continue to be cared for by their provider until they are discharged.
The following Bon Secours hospitals in Virginia are impacted by the health system’s renewed agreement with Cigna:
Hampton Roads:
Bon Secours – Mary Immaculate Hospital
Bon Secours – Maryview Medical Center
Bon Secours – Southampton Medical Center
Bon Secours – Harbour View Medical Center
Richmond:
Bon Secours – Memorial Regional Medical Center
Bon Secours – Rappahannock General Hospital

Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency for Kentucky ahead of expected storms and possible tornadoes over the next four days.
Beshear warned of “severe storms that are intense and long-lived” and a risk of tornadoes, hail, flooding and high winds across Kentucky.
Under his emergency order, Kentucky Emergency Operations Center, transportation officials and the Kentucky National Guard will be ready to respond if they’re needed.
“Tornadoes are expected, and I know that’s tough to hear. And we are most concerned about the area of Western Kentucky that has gotten hit far too much, as well as a wider area of Western Kentucky,” Beshear said in a statement. “Remember, these can be strong tornadoes, EF-2 and greater. We’re really concerned about people’s safety, especially in the overnight, because when storms or tornadoes hit while people are asleep, that’s sadly when we’ve lost the most people. So, everybody out there, be really careful.”
What’s expected?
West Kentucky and Western Kentucky are at the highest risk for tornadoes and other storms, according to the National Weather Service. Central Kentucky is under an “enhanced risk” and Eastern Kentucky is under “marginal” risk, according to NWS.
Starting Wednesday night, Western and West Kentucky can expect “a major outbreak of severe storms with strong, long track tornadoes, very large hail and damaging winds,” according to the National Weather Service. Winds could reach 70 miles per hour.
On Thursday and Friday, West Kentuckians in Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, Ballard, McCracken, Graves and the surrounding areas may experience flash flooding, “rapid rises on area rivers,” heavy rain and severe storms, according to NWS. Paducah is under a flash flood warning through Sunday and may see record-breaking rainfall.
NWS predicts up to 15 inches of rain in West Kentucky, with Western and Central Kentucky expecting a maximum of 10 inches.
Louisville is under a flood watch through Thursday.
Tips for safety
The National Weather Service recommends these safety tips during the type of storms Kentucky is bracing for:

Find shelter during the storm. Have a plan to go somewhere safe if you need to.
Do not drive through standing water.
Keep a flashlight, shoes and cell phone near your bed while you sleep. Make sure your phone is charged and weather alerts are turned on.
During a tornado, get as low as possible — the lowest room in the home, under a table. Get under something heavy and sturdy to protect yourself from debris.
During a tornado, stay away from windows and doors.

A bill regulating usage of artificial intelligence in elections received a hearing last week and is awaiting executive action.
Senate Bill 25, brought by Sen. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, adds definitions and disallows so-called “deepfakes” within 60 days of an election. There is an exception — if the media is marked as being artificially generated or edited, they would be allowed and the bill has a long list of stipulations depending on the media type.
“This isn’t something attacking free speech,” Ellis said in a March 25 hearing before the House State Administration Committee.
Candidates have two options for dealing with deep fakes — they’d be able to file an injunction and have the option of filing a complaint with the commissioner of political practices.
The injunctive relief for a candidate targeted by a deep fake is supposed to be immediate, with the bill going so far as to say it “must be expedited by the district court and given preference over all other matters currently before the district court upon showing of present or ongoing harm.”
A second offense would be a misdemeanor. The bill did generate some discussion over the specifics of the exceptions, with Ronda Wiggers of the Montana Broadcasters Association providing some soft opposition.
Her opposition boiled down to who would be accountable for running the material. The bill contains language that says “the person, corporation, committee, political party, or other entity knew or should have known (the material) is a deepfake of a candidate or political party on the ballot.”
Wiggers said she’d like to see that language removed.
“So we would like you to strike the words ‘or should have known,’ that’s all,” Wiggers said. “So that we don’t have to try to figure out how we should have known that something was a deep fake.”
There are 20 states with laws on the books regarding artificial intelligence in elections, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. It’s a rapidly developing field and there’s worry it will continue to be an issue in upcoming elections.
SB 25 seeks to address the problem before it becomes one in Montana, like much of the tech and artificial intelligence legislation this session.
“I don’t know how much of that is going on in Montana, but it’s a real problem in this country,” said Sen. Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, at a press availability Tuesday. “And I think we’re trying to get out in front of all those kinds of bad behaviors when it comes to AI.”
Elections have changed, Flowers said. Campaigns are getting “icky” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan added.
“We’ve opened the flood gates, and campaign spending and the social media component is outrageous and is used more and more and more by campaigns,” Sullivan, D-Missoula, said. 
She said the technology to make “deepfakes” of candidates is accessible to a lot of people.
“I would anticipate people would absolutely use that if they could. We should absolutely outlaw it,” Sullivan said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1428262683-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said in his opening statement at a hearing Wednesday.The Democratic attorneys general who brought the lawsuit against the federal agencies had requested a nationwide injunction, arguing the mass firings were illegal and harmed states financially, but Bredar only applied the order to the plaintiffs’ jurisdictions.Bredar has previously issued a temporary emergency order mandating agencies reinstate employment for all 24,418 fired probationary workers, according to government figures, but expressed reluctance at a March 26 hearing to extend his order nationwide. The breakdown of fired probationary employees by state is unclear and the total number could be from the states involved in the lawsuit or other states or both.Departments and agencies named as defendants in the lawsuit must now return the probationary workers’ jobs to status quo by 2 p.m. Eastern on April 8, Bredar ordered. The agencies also “shall not conduct any future reductions in force (“RIFs”) — whether formally labeled as such or not” involving the affected probationary employees unless the process follows the law, Bredar wrote.The enjoined defendants include:The departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense (civilian employees only), Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Small Business Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development.The order will remain in place while the case is pending.The states allege the mass firings led by Trump and Musk harmed them because the federal government did not provide the legally required advance notice that gives states time to prepare “rapid response activities” — including unemployment and social services — ahead of an influx of unemployed residents.Bredar highlighted in a memorandum opinion accompanying his order Tuesday that 31 states did not join the lawsuit, writing that nationwide injunctions are required in “rare” instances, and that “this case is not one of them.”“The Court’s injunction is not national in scope because it is possible to substantially stop the harms inflicted on the states that did sue without extending judicial authority over those that didn’t,” Bredar wrote.",,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

It passed after the Alabama House Ways and Means Education Committee delayed it last month due to concerns about how the benefit in the bill compares to the existing benefit for state employees. Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, said he worked with the sponsor and lawyers while the Legislature was on break last week.
“I made it very clear I am in 100% support of this bill and of workers’ comp for teachers,” he said. “There were just a couple of tweaks that needed to be made.”
Faulkner’s main concern was the appeals process for educators when they are injured on the job. In an amendment, Faulkner said the biggest change was spelling out the appeals process in the bill instead of referencing a part of the Alabama code. 
“We have that in the bill, the exact process, so people can see what the appeals process looks like,” Faulkner said.
The amendment was adopted unanimously.
Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, who carried the bill for Givhan in committee, said they had been “working through those (questions) and maybe all of these questions have been answered.” 
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the committee, said last month the bill needed more work. On Wednesday, Garrett said he was pleased with the changes.
“Thank you again for all the work you guys have done on the break,” Garrett said.
The bill moves to the full House.

Laura Kelly don't appear to be on the same page in terms of the new state budget adopted by the House and Senate. The package could leave state government in the red by $461 million within three years based on current revenue estimates and proposed spending. Nine months into the fiscal year, Kansas has taken in $165 million more in tax revenue that predicted in November. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Substantive income and sales tax reform in Kansas continued during March to carve new channels in the state revenue stream, officials said.
Adjustments to state retail sales tax policy by ending application of a 6.5% sales tax on grocery items contributed to a $89 million decline in collections during the first three quarters of the fiscal year compared to this point in the previous fiscal year. The sales tax, and associated compensating use tax, has delivered $2.6 billion to the state during the fiscal year starting July 1.
The Legislature and Gov. Laura Kelly agreed last year to eliminate a personal income tax bracket and lower the highest individual income rate to 4.58% retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. That was combined with a reduction in the state’s corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% effective Jan. 1, 2024.
The Kansas Department of Revenue reported the state took in $88 million less year-to-date in corporate income taxes than at this juncture one year ago. That decline exceeded projections of state analysts by more than $11 million.
Shrinkage in corporate income tax collections has been eclipsed, however, by the surprise $200 million increase in individual income tax collections through March compared to the previous year. State analysts underestimated growth in individual income tax revenue by $187 million.
Three-fourths into the fiscal year, Kansas state government was more than $110 million up in terms of corporate and individual income tax revenue.
Overall, the Department of Revenue said Kansas received $6.9 billion in revenue from all tax sources in the current fiscal year. That represented a $47 million, or 0.7%, increase from the previous fiscal year. Kansas has taken in $165 million more in tax revenue through the initial nine months of the fiscal year than predicted by state financial analysts.
The consensus revenue group, comprised of individuals from the Department of Revenue, Kansas Department of Administration, Kansas Legislative Research Department as well as economists from University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Wichita State University, scheduled a meeting April 17 to evaluate economic conditions and make changes to state revenue projections.
The Legislature sent the governor last week a new state budget that could put Kansas in a $461 million budget hole within three years.
On KCUR’s Up To Date program Monday, Kelly said she was apprehensive about the Republican-led Legislature’s spending plan and compared it to the approach taken by Gov. Sam Brownback more than a decade ago when income taxes were aggressively slashed. The result was a five-year calamity that prompted state budget cuts and an increase in the statewide sales tax. The Legislature repealed, over Brownback’s objection, much of his tax program in 2017.
“With the budget they’ve passed, we will be way underwater,” Kelly told KCUR.
The governor said the Legislature could modify the budget legislation when it reconvened April 10 or gather for a special session after new state revenue estimates were released.
Kelly vetoed a bill Monday that would have left in place the previous year’s state budget if the Legislature and governor failed to agree on a budget deal.
She said she wouldn’t sanction Senate Bill 14 because it could freeze the budget in a manner not contemplated “through periods of war, famine, pandemic, recession, the Dust Bowl and even the Great Depression.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, and Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said they planned to rally votes necessary to override Kelly’s veto of SB14.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation efforts targeted at the Mexican gray wolf have shown positive results, according to recent studies, but last weekend’s death of a female wolf has been called “tragic” by experts and advocates.
The death of wandering wolf “Ella” was reported over the weekend by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after she was spotted last week near Mount Taylor, close to Grants above Interstate 40. She had wandered outside of the Marquez Wildlife Area —  a protected area that covers about 15,000 acres in McKinley and Sandoval counties and where wolves are encouraged to remain. Interstate 40 is the northern boundary. The area is part of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area that encompasses parts of New Mexico and Arizona and where wolves are released into the wild to repopulate.
The wildlife service reported that her body was found on Sunday and told Source NM that her death is under investigation, as is protocol for every known deceased wolf. Due to the investigation, a spokesperson for the wildlife service said they are not releasing details about the wolf’s cause of death or the exact location she was found.
Ella was a member of the Sawtooth pack in New Mexico, according to Aislinn Maestas, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who added that “every Mexican wolf in the wild contributed to recovery of the subspecies,” further emphasizing the disappointment conservationists have voiced over Ella’s death.
She was one of about 160 Mexican gray wolves living in the wild in New Mexico, according to a recent census.
“Ella’s death is a profound loss—not just for her species, but for all of us who saw in her journey a glimpse of what recovery could look like,” Claire Musser, executive director of the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, said in a statement. “She was young, instinct-driven, and full of possibility. By venturing north, she was reclaiming space that wolves once called home. Her story deserves more than mourning—it demands action to ensure other wolves have the freedom to thrive where she could not.”
Sally Paez, staff attorney for New Mexico Wild, told Source NM that she understood Ella was relatively young and around the age where she would be looking for a mate to establish her own pack, adding to the impact of her death. She said Ella was particularly interesting because she wandered outside of the Marquez Wildlife Area.
“Research has shown, and just common sense and experience — traveling around other parts of New Mexico and then Northern Arizona and Southern Colorado — there’s other places that are really suitable wolf habitat where we don’t currently have wolf populations,” Paez told Source NM. “This is a wolf who, I think, was traveling through areas that could provide good wildlife corridors.”
Paez said the Mount Taylor area provides a good area for wolves because of its “wild ecosystem,” elk herds and restoration work.
“I think it was really exciting that she was already drawn to a place that we know is good habitat and where we’d like to see wolf populations thrive,” Paez said. 
According to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a five-year evaluation of the Mexican wolf population showed growth surpassing experts’ targets.
Maestas added that the Mexican wolf population has had nine years of growth and there is an estimated minimum 286 wolves in the wild, including New Mexico and surrounding states. 
“Genetic management efforts are showing results,” Maestas told Source in an email. “These achievements are cause for celebration and give hope that recovery of the Mexican wolf is not only possible, but on the horizon.”

Cory Booker on April 1, 2025 broke the record for talking on the Senate floor as he challenged the Trump administration","Sen. Cory Booker's 25-hour-plus speech broke a record previously held by a South Carolina senator who tried to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act. (John Partipilo)

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.

Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

(University of Maine image)Three years after they began, negotiations over a proposed power contract for an offshore floating wind farm in the Gulf of Maine have come to an abrupt halt, with the developer citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape that have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.”
In a March 28 filing at the Public Utilities Commission, the PUC staff explained that Pine Tree Offshore Wind LLC has requested that the talks be temporarily suspended.
The request is not a total surprise, due to rising material costs worldwide and efforts by President Donald Trump to dismantle the nascent domestic industry. But it still represents a blow to Maine’s long-term efforts to position floating offshore wind as a major new source of clean energy and economic development.
Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office, said in an emailed statement that the office “understands and respects Pine Tree Offshore Wind’s request to pause negotiations for the state’s research array, in reflection of current uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.
Offshore wind, including the research array, is an important part of Maine’s long-term energy future, and GEO will continue to work on responsible offshore wind research and development to advance economic and environmental benefits for Maine.”
When asked specifically why it was putting talks on hold, Pine Tree Offshore Wind declined to comment and referred questions to the GEO.
Maine must deploy and test full-size versions of this platform design far offshore, in a so-called research array. After three years of negotiations, state regulators had been planning to decide by late March if a proposed contract for utilities to buy power from a 12-platform wind farm was in the public interest.
The proposed research array, 30 miles off Portland, was expected to be a critical stepping stone to a commercial-scale wind farm in the Gulf of Maine.
Maine is playing a long game on offshore wind. But its standing with global investors and developers could hinge on what happens with the test hull and research array contract over the next year or so.
Without the contract, Maine will lose its best chance to compete in floating offshore wind, according to Chris Wissemann, chief executive officer of Diamond Offshore Wind, which plans to build the array. Diamond is a subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp., and is part of related subsidiaries called New England Aqua Ventus LLC and Pine Tree Offshore Wind LLC. Diamond has invested $20 million so far pursuing that goal, he said.
“If the research array is not approved early this year,” Wissemann told The Maine Monitor last January, “Maine’s leadership in offshore wind is lost, I believe, probably forever. The industry will conclude that Maine won’t do anything. Too much time has gone on.”
Maine is not the only state facing headwinds on offshore wind development. Utility companies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts also announced this week that they would delay contract negotiations amidst federal uncertainty.
“This is a reaction to the uncertainty and hostility that’s coming from the federal government,” said Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “Nobody knows if they’re going to get any kind of permit at all.”
For supporters of offshore wind energy, the discouraging news regarding the research array contract was offset somewhat this week, following news that the University of Maine on Sunday had launched a second prototype of its patented floating wind turbine platform. Researchers put the 52-foot wide, quarter scale hull in the water at Bar Harbor, the Bangor Daily News reported. The platform will be towed to a test site off Castine.
It has been 12 years since UMaine tested a one-eighth scale version of the platform at the same location. Since then, the UMaine team has worked to refine the 380-ton concrete, semi-submersible design, which would be built at full scale when a 12-turbine research array is finally developed, now planned for sometime in the 2030s.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The state could not take a person out of consideration for becoming a foster or adoptive parent based on their “sincerely held moral and religious beliefs” on gender identity and sexual orientation under a bill passed by a House subcommittee Wednesday.
While supporters of Senate File 473 said the measure would increase Iowa’s pool of prospective parents, others said the measure could put LGBTQ+ youth and families at risk for discrimination. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services could not require a prospective foster or adoptive parent to accept policies that conflict with their moral and religious beliefs related to LGBTQ+ people in order to be eligible for licensing or to be an individual child’s caretaker.
The bill also states a person cannot be precluded as a choice for becoming a child’s foster or adoptive parent based on their beliefs including factors like “the person’s intent to guide, instruct, or raise a child in a manner consistent with the person’s sincerely held religious or moral beliefs.”
Matthew Tate-Smith, the parent of four adopted children and foster parent of 14 children alongside his partner, said families like his could face discrimination in the foster and adoption placement process for their gender identity or sexual orientation. But he said more importantly, the bill could put children in this system at risk.
“What’s especially alarming is that this bill could place LGBTQ foster kids with prospective parents who might want to engage in the debunked practice of so-called ‘conversion therapy,'” Tate-Smith said. “… These kids deserve supportive and affirming homes and families that will welcome them with open arms, instead of attempting to fundamentally change who they are. Simply put, this is not in the best interest of foster children.”
“Conversion therapy,” sometimes referred to as “reparative therapy,” are practices that attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity and expression. Medical organizations have overwhelmingly found that these practices are unscientific and are not recommended for children’s behavioral health treatment, and a 2020 study in the American Journal of Public Health found LGBTQ+ youth who were subject to conversion therapy were more likely to attempt suicide.
But advocates in favor of the bill said that the measure was needed to ensure that families with religious beliefs that do not affirm LGBTQ+ identities are not excluded from the pool of adoptive and foster parent applicants. Lance Kinzer with the 1st Amendment Partnership, a religious rights organization, said the measure was needed in light of policies in other states like Oregon where a prospective parent was denied certification after stating her religious beliefs would prevent her from they affirming a child’s gender identity or sexual orientation if they are transgender or attracted to the same gender.
Kinzer noted the Iowa legislation would still allow the department to take into account the “sincerely held moral and religious beliefs” related to LGBTQ+ identities of the child and their family of origin when determining the best placement for the child.
“What’s happening in other states is that people are being told not merely that they may not be the best placement for, say, a gender dysphoric 15-year-old, but because of their religious beliefs, they can’t foster any child, even a 15-year-old who attends their own congregation, who agrees with their religious beliefs,” Kinzer said.
Jim Florence, an adoptive parent of two children, said this issue is happening in Iowa, claiming he faced discrimination while going through the foster parent licensing process.
Florence said the discrimination occurred during the placement of two boys who they fostered that were adopted by a same-sex couple.  One of the children had told staff that “he wanted a mom and a dad, not two dads,” Florence said, and after he and his wife told the contracted organization and Iowa HHS that they believed the placement was not in the child’s best interest, he said they were “accused of forcing our religious beliefs on these children” and had their foster care license placed on hold.
He said the bill would prevent these situations from occurring in the future.
“The state’s responsibility is to consider a child’s beliefs and values when placing them in a foster or adoptive home,” Florence said. “As Christian parents, we try to protect these children’s Christian convictions. We advocated for the children’s rights to an adoptive home with similar beliefs and values to their own. Ultimately, the desires of the same-sex couple were given preference. Not only were we discriminated against, the fundamental rights of a child were ignored.”
The bill moved forward with support from Reps. Steven Holt, R-Denison, and Craig Williams, R-Manning. Holt reiterated the bill would take into consideration the beliefs of the child and family of origin when making a foster or adoptive care placement.
“This is removing the viewpoint of discrimination that currently exists against people of faith,” Holt said. “I think it is protective of both sides of the equation.”
Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the bill, saying that it was essential for children to be placed with families that will provide support regardless of their identity.
“Foster children are children in crisis, and their needs have to be put first,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “Children must be in environments that have affirming care, and not somebody who’s trying to change them, but to help them.”

Gretchen Whitmer discusses the Fiscal Year 2025 Education Budget at Educare in Flint. | Kyle DavidsonFollowing a string of ice storms which tore through the northern Lower Peninsula over the weekend, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is expanding her initial state of emergency and deploying the Michigan National Guard to help clear roadways and areas overcome by debris. 
On Monday afternoon, Whitmer declared a state of emergency in for Otsego, Oscoda, Montmorency, Presque Isle, Emmet, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Mackinac and Alpena counties, expanding the declaration to include Alcona and Antrim counties on Tuesday.
By declaring a state of emergency, Whitmer has made all state resources available in cooperation with local response and recovery efforts in the area of emergency. It also authorizes the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division to further coordinate state efforts, following the governor’s activation of the State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday. 
In addition to the two teams assigned to clear debris, the Michigan National Guard has responded to a request from the MyMichigan Medical Center in Alpena to stand up a temporary shelter to support emergency room overflow. 
With many counties experiencing widespread power outages and fuel shortages, Whitmer’s office said temporary fuel depots are necessary. Signing an executive order, Whitmer has temporarily suspended restrictions on commercial driver hours as well as seasonal load restrictions to ensure there is a consistent flow of gasoline, distillate and propane alongside the transport of equipment to address transportation and supply needs.
According to a report from MLive, 90,000 homes and businesses were left without power at the storm’s peak.
While Whitmer was initially scheduled to give an address in Washington D.C. on Thursday centered on American manufacturing and national defense, the governor has postponed her speech to remain in Michigan and coordinate emergency response efforts. 



The governor’s office also shared the following updates on resources for Michiganders impacted by the storms:

Utility crews are continuing to restore power to the impacted areas. 
The Mackinac Bridge is closed due to concerns about melting ice falling onto cars. The bridge will reopen once it is deemed safe by authorities.   
The Michigan Department of Transportation is working with county road commissions to clear state trunklines and secondary roads. 
Approximately 20 shelters have been stood up in the area which are being run by the Red Cross. Residents are encouraged to dial 211 for local information. 
Food is provided by the Salvation Army and local food banks at shelters. Residents are encouraged to dial 211 for local information. 
300 oxygen tanks are being delivered to Montmorency County with two oxygen refill stations sent to address concerns for residents. One refill tank will be at the Emergency Management Services building in Indian River, and another at the MyMichigan Medical Center in Alpena. Residents who require oxygen refills will need to come to the locations for assistance.  
Southern Baptist, Team Rubicon and World Renew Volunteer Organizations have been mobilized to assist with clean up.

House Bill 443 proposes asking North Carolinians to approve a constitutional amendment that would restrict the governor to a preselected list of candidates for Council of State vacancies determined by the political party of the departing official. This would apply to all Council of State officers with the exception of the lieutenant governor, for whom there is not a mechanism to appoint an interim replacement.
The bill’s requirements mirror those that the General Assembly created for interim state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals vacancies in Senate Bill 382, the Hurricane Helene relief bill that substantially shifted power away from elected offices held by Democrats passed shortly after Governor Josh Stein’s election.
Under those requirements too, Stein is required to pick from a predetermined list of three potential nominees selected by the previous judge’s political party — a restriction Stein is now suing to block, arguing that it violates the state constitution’s broad grant of authority to the governor to make appointments. The state similarly requires that interim U.S. Senators appointed by the governor are members of the same party as their predecessor.
Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), presenting H.B. 443 in the absence of its lead sponsor, Rep. Kyle Hall (R-Forsyth), said this bill proposes a constitutional amendment instead of a statutory change in part to avoid the legislature changing the law for political advantage due to “particular circumstances.”
“It’s a transparent process for replacing people in that you can see who was recommended to the governor and the governor picks from from that group of individuals,” Hall said. “It would maintain at least until the next election, the party affiliation, if you will, of the person that the voters last chose for the office.”
Mark Swallow, a representative with Democracy Out Loud, raised concerns about the bill in public comment, arguing that the state’s constitution should be “more apolitical than political.”
“In considering this as something that’s going to be put into our constitution, our North Carolina constitution, it seems like there should be a very deliberate, very bipartisan type of action,” Swallow said. “We would think this is more of a statute or a bill than a constitutional amendment.”
Gambling proposal draws opposition
More contentious was the debate over House Bill 424, which would legalize betting on card, tile, and dice games in some private spaces such as residences and community clubhouses.
Multiple representatives as well as John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, raised concerns that ambiguity in the bill could expand the scope of legal gambling far more than intended, warning that private enterprises may try to take advantage of loopholes to run what are essentially casinos.
Due to the contention around the bill, members on the panel proceeded to a voice vote, ultimately giving it a favorable recommendation by a 7-3 vote. The constitutional amendment proposal passed by voice vote. HB 443 will proceed to the Committee on State and Local Government for further discussion, while HB 424 now heads to the House Rules committee.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-02 11:10:24.718005

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state. Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.
Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Autumn Bertels is an accomplished, wheelchair-mobile biology student at the University of Kansas who will graduate this May.
But after requesting accommodations for a chemistry lab due to lab tables being too tall, she was met with delays and excuses. She could only fully participate in one of 11 labs during the semester.
Now, Bertels is the 2025 Ms. Wheelchair Kansas titleholder, which will allow her to advocate for the wheelchair community and educate others throughout the state about accessibility in higher education. 
“Everyone has the right to equal opportunity, quality and access of education, and there are so many ways that we can do this,” Bertels said. “Everyone has a right to education, and you shouldn’t have to be a disabled person to combat these challenges.”
Ms. Wheelchair Kansas has uplifted women like Bertels for 20 years with a contest to select the most well-rounded, confident and wheelchair-mobile contestant to serve as a statewide role model. The organization’s mission is to provide the opportunity to compete in a pageant regardless of disability. 
CEO and 2004 titleholder Carrie Greenwood says this was the ultimate goal in bringing the contest to Kansas.
“We got here one year and one title holder at a time,” Greenwood said. “I had no idea that it would last this long and that it would really become my passion. Or that we would impact so many people in our state. It’s worth it to empower all the ladies who are here.”

The contest has grown steadily each year. Thirty-eight women have competed for the adult title, with winners making more than 500 appearances in more than 65 cities across Kansas. They added the Little Miss title in 2015 and the Junior Miss title this year. Most recently, 2024 titleholder Tamara Blackwell became the first Kansan to win the national title.
“I have had the privilege to sit in rooms and be before people that I have never thought I would,” Blackwell said. “I am so elated because that’s been able to push Ms. Wheelchair Kansas in the spotlight, and I hope that it helps only shine a brighter light to show the beauty that lies within the community. That we are intelligent, that we are equipped, that we may be in chairs, we may be different, but there’s nothing wrong with being different. And I just love that.”
Bertels said she wants to use her platform to cultivate better accessibility and education about disabilities at other college campuses in the state. She will also serve as a mentor for the two younger titleholders and compete at the national level in August.
“We live in a time where accommodations aren’t readily available to those who need them,” she said. “My Little Miss is also focusing on education as well, which is really great for both of us to work on.”
Isabel Einwich, Junior Miss 2025, was motivated to advocate for better awareness in education for those with disabilities. She says it took a broken elevator for her school administrators to realize they didn’t have an emergency plan for students in wheelchairs.
“It shouldn’t have to take a broken elevator to raise these questions. I hope to continue sharing my story and having opportunities to bring more attention to school issues surrounding disabilities through education,” Einwich said. “I just hope we can get to a point where we hear much less of that phrase, “Oh, we didn’t think about that.’ ”
Everyone involved — whether contestants, parents or volunteers — agree that the community has driven the organization’s growth and success. Greenwood believes these contestants are essential to the broader Kansas community.
“I ask everyone and anyone to get involved in this organization. It shows the value of diversity and working for a common purpose,” Greenwood said. “When you put your heart into something it will always succeed. And our title holders, they are what’s made this organization a success. They are the backbone of what we do, and they represent women and young girls who are wheelchair mobile so well.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0334-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-02 10:06:41.272891

Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings [&#8230;]","Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in rural South Dakota, says private Medicare plans jeopardized the company's finances while impeding patient care. So last year, Brookings dropped four contracts it had with Medicare Advantage companies. (Robb Long for KFF Health News)Rural hospital leaders are questioning whether they can continue to afford to do business with Medicare Advantage companies, and some say the only way to maintain services and protect patients is to end their contracts with the private insurers.
Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in South Dakota. Merkley worried the losses would spark staff layoffs and cuts to patient services. So last year, Brookings Health dropped all four contracts it had with major Medicare Advantage companies.
“I’ve had lots of discussions with CEOs and executive teams across the country in regard to that,” said Merkley, whose health system operates a hospital and clinics in the small city of Brookings and surrounding rural areas.
Merkley and other rural hospital operators in recent years have enumerated a long list of concerns about the publicly funded, privately run health plans. In addition to the reimbursement issue, their complaints include payment delays and a resistance to authorizing patient care.
But rural hospitals abandoning their Medicare Advantage contracts can leave local patients without nearby in-network providers or force them to scramble to switch coverage.
Medicare is the main federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. Participants can enroll in traditional, government-run Medicare or in a Medicare Advantage plan run by a private insurance company.
In 2024, 56% of urban Medicare recipients were enrolled in a private plan, according to a report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a federal agency that advises Congress. While just 47% of rural recipients enrolled in a private plan, Medicare Advantage has expanded more quickly in rural areas.
In recent years, average Medicare Advantage reimbursements to rural hospitals were about 90% of what traditional Medicare paid, according to a new report from the American Hospital Association. And traditional Medicare already pays hospitals much less than private plans, according to a recent study by Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer at the National Rural Health Association, said Medicare Advantage is particularly challenging for small rural facilities designated critical access hospitals. Traditional Medicare pays such hospitals extra, but the private insurance companies aren’t required to do so.
“The vast majority of our rural hospitals are not in a position where they can take further cuts to payment,” Cochran-McClain said. “There are so many that are just really in a precarious financial spot.”
Nearly 200 rural hospitals have ended inpatient services or shuttered since 2005.
Mehmet Oz — doctor, former talk show host, and President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — has promoted and worked for the private Medicare industry and called for “Medicare Advantage for all.” But during his recent confirmation hearing, he called for more oversight as he acknowledged bipartisan concerns about the plans’ cost to taxpayers and their effect on patients.
Cochran-McClain said some Republican lawmakers want to address these issues while supporting Medicare Advantage.
“But I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to really know what direction that’s all going to take,” she said.
Medicare Advantage plans can offer lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for some participants. Nearly all offer extra benefits, such as vision, hearing, and dental coverage. Many also offer perks, such as gym memberships, nutrition services, and allowances for over-the-counter health supplies.
But a recent study in the Health Services Research journal found that rural patients on private plans struggled to access and afford care more often than rural enrollees on traditional Medicare and urban participants in both kinds of plans.
Susan Reilly, a spokesperson for the Better Medicare Alliance, said a recent report published by her group, which promotes Medicare Advantage, found that private plans are more affordable than traditional Medicare for rural beneficiaries. That analysis was conducted by an outside firm and based on a government survey of Medicare recipients.
Reilly also pointed to a study in The American Journal of Managed Care that found the growth of private plans in rural areas from 2008-2019 was associated with increased financial stability for hospitals and a reduced risk of closure.
Merkley said that’s not what he’s seeing on the ground in rural South Dakota.
He said traditional Medicare reimbursed Brookings Health System 91 cents for every dollar it spent on care in 2023, while Medicare Advantage plans paid 76 cents per dollar spent. He said his staff tried negotiating better contracts with the big Medicare Advantage companies, to no avail.
Patients who remain on private plans that no longer contract with their local hospitals and clinics may face higher prices unless they travel to in-network facilities, which in rural areas can be hours away. Merkley said most patients at Brookings Health switched to traditional Medicare or to regional Medicare Advantage plans that work better with the hospital system.
But switching from private to traditional Medicare can be unaffordable for patients.
That’s because in most states, Medigap plans — supplemental plans that help people on traditional Medicare cover out-of-pocket costs — can deny coverage or base their prices on patients’ medical history if they switch from a private plan.
Some rural health systems say they no longer work with any Medicare Advantage companies. They include Great Plains Health, which serves parts of rural Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and Kimball Health Services, which is based in two small towns in Nebraska and Wyoming.
Medicare Advantage plans often limit the providers patients can see and require referrals and prior authorization for certain services. Requesting referrals, seeking preauthorization, and appealing denials can delay treatment for patients while adding extra work for doctors and billing staff.
“The unique rural lens on that is that rural providers really tend to be pretty bare-bone shops,” Cochran-McClain said. “That kind of administrative burden pulls people away from really being able to focus on providing quality care to their beneficiaries.”
Jonathon Green, CEO of Taylor Health Care Group in rural Georgia, said his system had to set up a team to deal solely with coverage denials, mostly from Medicare Advantage companies. He said some plans frequently decline to authorize payments before treatments, refuse to cover services they already approved, and deny payment for care that shouldn’t need approval.
In these cases, Green said, the companies argue that the care wasn’t appropriate for the patient.
“We hear that term constantly — ‘It’s not medically necessary,’” he said. “That’s the catchall for everything.”
Green said Taylor Health Care Group has considered dropping its Medicare Advantage contracts but is keeping them for now.
Cochran-McClain said her group supports policy changes, such as a federal bill that aims to streamline prior authorization while requiring Medicare Advantage companies to share data about the process. The 2024 bill was co-sponsored by more than half of U.S. senators, but needs to be reintroduced this year.
Cochran-McClain said rural-health advocates also want the government to require private plans to pay critical access hospitals and similar rural facilities as much as they would receive from traditional Medicare.
Green and Merkley stressed that they aren’t against the concept of private Medicare plans; they just want them to be fairer to rural facilities and patients.
Green said rural and independent hospitals don’t have the leverage that urban hospitals and large chains do in negotiations with giant Medicare Advantage companies.
“We just don’t have the ability to swing the pendulum enough,” he said.

Cory Booker's 25-hour-plus speech broke a record previously held by a South Carolina senator who tried to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act. (Photo: John Partipilo/NJ Monitor)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.

“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”

Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”

Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.

Lacking empathy and understanding of the positive role of public education, the president is calling for the department’s termination. Not surprising, as he has stated his love for “the poorly educated.” The lead mission statement on the DE website [&#8230;]","The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building pictured on Nov. 25, 2024. (Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Political and media blather about the potential demise of the Department of Education (DE) is continuous. Lacking empathy and understanding of the positive role of public education, the president is calling for the department’s termination. Not surprising, as he has stated his love for “the poorly educated.”
The lead mission statement on the DE website is “Fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.” Federal policies and funding have helped create better opportunities for students with disabilities and others that require more resources for their education. Along with anti-DEI initiatives, many students of poverty and color will be denied equal access.
One of the self-created functions of the Department of Education has been the delivery of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). A standardized test titled as “The Nation’s Report Card”, that assesses reading and mathematics nationwide at the 4th and  8th grade levels.
The NAEP claims to offer “a common measure of student achievement” and “offers a window into the state of our K-12 education system and what our children are learning.”
The NAEP’s stated purpose of “is to measure the educational achievement and progress of the nation’s students …” NAEP results have been stagnant for decades. In 1992, 29% of students were considered proficient (or above) readers in both 4th and 8th grades. In 2024, proficiency levels were 31%  for 4th grade and 30% for 8th grade. 
“NAEP results also enable comparisons …, among various demographic groups, and over time.” NAEP test scores have accurately reflected demographic differences of school populations for decades. Schools, districts and states with lower family income levels, lower parent education levels, higher numbers of English language learners and special education students have lower test score averages. Year, after year, after year.
The Nation’s Report Card is a political hoax; not an accurate measure of learning. Presumed to be a reliable measure of school quality; it is not. Differences in test score averages always reflect student demographics.
Educators (especially educational leaders) need to stop pretending that they have considerable influence over test scores. Standardized tests are designed to allow predetermined percentages of rank. If proficiency is set at the 60th percentile (a common standard), only 40% of students can attain proficiency. NAEP reading proficiency levels nationwide have never reached 40%.
Profound improvements in test score averages come about by changing the demographics of the student population tested or by “cheating.” Retaining low level readers in 3rd grade changes the tested population in 4th grade. Removing failing students improves test score averages; regardless of curriculum or instructional method.
In Mississippi, NAEP 4th grade reading scores have increased from 21% proficient in 2013 to 32% in 2024. They attribute this “Mississippi miracle” to 3rd grade reading instruction with increased emphasis on phonics and seem overly proud that still less than one third of their students are considered literate by this measure.
Mississippi began a retention policy during the 2014-15 for 3rd graders with low-level reading levels. Thus, removing 7 to 9% (2019-23) of failing students from the tested population of 4th graders.
It seems reading deficiencies are not the only academic shortcomings in Mississippi. Basic math skills seem to have eluded state policymakers. Simple statistical comparisons should embarrass politicians and educators in Mississippi.
They pretend to have nailed the “science of reading” while lacking evidence linking phonics to improved 4th grade reading scores. There is a clear connection between the percentages of retained 3rd grade students and 4th grade proficiency levels.
There is no evidence that retention improves academic achievement in later grades or that retained students ever catch-up. There have been no sustainable gains in the reading ability of Mississippi students. 8th grade NAEP reading scores have declined, as have ACT scores, since the 3rd grade retention policy was adopted.
However, there is evidence that retention contributes to higher dropout and lower graduation rates. The threat of retention does not raise test scores.
It should be called the “Mississippi mirage.” This false claim of success is just a matter of fudging statistics. An illusion that would not play well on the Strip. Nevada is on tap to follow the same failed 3rd grade retention policy (as Mississippi) in 2029.
Low-level readers are not lazy. They didn’t choose to be in the bottom reading groups in first and second grades. If terminated, the NAEP would be missed only by politicians and media pundits that use test scores to unfairly denigrate public education and at-risk students.
Across the country, including Nevada, there is an obsession with the ill effects of the pandemic on academic achievement. There were no permanent effects on long-term academic outcomes and lives were saved by shutting down in-person classroom instruction. Test scores have mostly rebounded to previous levels with the same demographic gaps.
Spoiler alert for CCSD: Extended school days and longer academic years have never provided an effective solution to closing standardized test score gaps. There is a saturation point for learning. More of the same will not change outcomes.
Test scores have become the accepted measure for school success; despite a lack of evidence that differences in school settings and educational practices appreciably affect individual test scores. There is a continued fascination with comparisons of standardized test scores using the same tired statistical data when annual results are released. It is nonsense.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pb250082_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:59:16.089525

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)The Democratic primary to replace a Lee County legislator who unexpectedly resigned in January is heading to an automatic recount.
Keishan Scott, a Bishopville City Council member, was winning Tuesday by just 10 votes among 2,860 cast. Scott had 1,435 votes to Carl Whetsel’s 1,425, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission.
State law requires a recount when the winning margin is less than 1%.
The special election is needed to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation just three days into the 2025 session.
The district covers all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties.
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November and the recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
Scott, who won his city council seat in 2023 at age 22, did not return to a phone call Tuesday from the SC Daily Gazette requesting comment.
Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and former Bishopville City Council member, told the Gazette he’s “going to let the process take its course.” No matter the result of the recount, he feels like a winner, said the Army combat veteran.
SC House Democrat unexpectedly resigns after easily winning a 5th term

Wheeler’s resignation left the rural district without a representative for this year’s entire regular session, which ends in May.
The special election is set for June 3. The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican William Oden, chairman of the Sumter County GOP. No other Republican filed for the seat traditionally held by a Democrat, so a GOP primary was unnecessary.
Wheeler first won election in 2016 with an eight-way primary to replace Bishopville Democrat Grady Brown, who retired after 32 years in the chamber.
Wheeler told reporters in January he could no longer dedicate the time needed to represent his district. He also said he plans to run for a judicial seat in 2026. State law requires legislators to be out of office for at least a year before running to be a judge.
The primary to replace him happened to be the same day the House’s newest member was sworn into office.
Democrat Courtney Waters officially won a special election last week to fill the seat vacated last fall by former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis. No Republican ran for the heavily Democratic district representing North Charleston.
Waters’ swearing in brought the number of Democrats in the chamber to 35. Republicans hold a supermajority with 88 seats.
Whetsel said he feels confident there will be a 36th Democrat no matter who’s declared the recount winner.
“Myself or Mr. Scott, whoever wins is going to be a good candidate for District 50,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/south-carolina-house.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:59:16.089525

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) After her wrongful death lawsuit against the Salt Lake City Police Department was dismissed last week, Shauna Mayne, the mother of a woman killed by her ex-husband in 2022, says she will appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. 
There, she hopes her lawsuit will spur a change in Utah law that currently gives governments immunity in wrongful death lawsuits — a change her attorney says could result in police departments giving officers better resources and training.  


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



“This was the expected, in fact, desired result,” said Judson Burton, Mayne’s attorney.
Mayne sued the department in March 2024, about two years after her daughter, Amanda “Mandy” Mayne, was shot by Taylor Martin, her ex-husband. In the lawsuit, attorneys argue officers should have done more to intervene when Martin showed up at Mandy Mayne’s workplace and made threats, just two days before the murder. 
However, Utah law prevents lawsuits against a governmental entity for wrongful death, if that death was caused in part by an assault or battery. Now that the case has been dismissed, Burton said he’ll file an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, with the goal of stripping the government of its immunity in these cases. 
With no immunity, Burton said police departments would be forced to implement changes in how they respond to domestic violence. 
“Potential liability brings about a change in behavior,” Burton said. “We’d hope that it brings about a change at a systemic level — that the police officers out there pounding the pavement, doing the hard work of trying to keep people safe, are given the resources and the training they need to properly evaluate the lethality potential every time they’re responding to a case of domestic violence.”  
Martin had a lengthy rap sheet, and had made repeated threats to Mandy Mayne and her family after he returned from a one-year stint in jail, including a text to Shauna Mayne that read “your daughter will be killed,” according to court documents. Those threats were investigated by Taylorsville police. 
Wrongful death lawsuit says SLC police didn’t do enough to stop murder of Lt. Gov.’s cousin

In August 2022, just two days before the murder, Martin showed up to Mandy Mayne’s workplace and threatened her new boyfriend. As police escorted him off the property, he told officers “I’m not going back to jail. … You guys are going to kill me before you get me into those gates,” according to court documents. 
Then on Aug. 17, 2022, between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., Martin shot Mandy Mayne 14 times as she arrived at a bus stop in Taylorsville, headed to work. He then walked down the street and fatally shot himself. 
In the original complaint, attorneys representing the Mayne family alleged that Martin’s behavior in the days leading up to the murder warranted more action from Salt Lake City police officers. The complaint also argues that officers missed multiple red flags that suggested Martin posed a danger to Mayne and her family. And, Mayne’s attorneys say, police failed to properly investigate witness statements, communication from Martin, and to “arrange, facilitate and provide” Mayne with services available to victims of violence.
The Salt Lake City Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit, instead pointing to previous court filings. In a motion to dismiss the case, filed in August, attorneys for the department say the Utah Governmental Immunity Act shields governments from wrongful death lawsuits.

Citing that law, Utah’s 3rd District Court Judge Laura Scott dismissed the case on March 26. Once the court’s final judgement is filed, Burton will file a notice of appeal — the Utah Supreme Court could decide to hear the case, or it might first defer to the Utah Court of Appeals. 
Either way, the dismissal was expected.   
“I understand this is a step forward for our case and am grateful to know that Mandy is one step closer to getting her day in court,” Shauna Mayne said in a statement. “I believe we have a chance to make a real difference in how police approach domestic violence cases. Victims of domestic violence deserve to have their safety taken seriously.” 
Legislature snubs funding for domestic violence health care service, forcing nonprofit to fundraise

If the case is successful, it would be the second time Mayne’s murder was the catalyst for a change in state law, and the way law enforcement officers interact with victims of intimate partner violence. 
The murder highlighted the gaps in how police respond to instances of intimate partner violence, and the lack of coordination between agencies. Mayne was the cousin of Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who in the months that followed the murder, advocated for legislation that required law enforcement around the state to implement a lethality assessment protocol, which identifies the most serious cases of intimate partner violence. 
Nicknamed “Mandy’s Law,” the bill passed in 2023 and has been credited for a dramatic increase in victim referrals to domestic violence shelters and service providers around the state.

SB 40, sponsored by Rep. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, passed 93-1. Known as the Houston-Hunter Act, it would provide liability protection for federally-licensed firearms dealers who choose to participate in the Safer Together Program, where they may accept surrendered firearms from community members.
“They can place their weapon in there and they can walk away,” Bedsole, who carried the Senate bill in the House, said.

He said any federally licensed firearm dealer or gun store can choose to participate in the program.
Bedsole sponsors the House version of the bill, which passed the House 98-2 in February. 
Alabama has some of the highest rates of firearm death in the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,278 Alabamians died by gunfire in 2022, a rate of 25.5 per 100,000 people, the fourth highest in the nation and a larger total than New York States, which has almost four times the population of Alabama. 
The CDC said 840 Alabamians died by suicide in 2022. That ranks Alabama 26th for suicides per capita. In the United States, 54% of suicides were done by gunfire.
Rep. Travis Hendrix, D-Birmingham, a former policeman, shared a story of a co-worker that almost committed suicide.
“If this program was available two years ago, he probably would’ve been in a better situation,” Hendrix said.
Bedsole said the idea for the bill came from a crisis intervention conference he went to in Indiana. He said he met some people from Alabama that told him about the nonprofit program.
“Here’s the heart and passion: If we can save just one person’s life and prevent them from using their own weapon as an act of suicide, then this program is worth it,” he said.
The bill passed with a House Judiciary Committee substitute that mirrored the language of the House bill in the Senate bill. It goes to the Senate for concurrence or a conference committee.

A long-awaited bill, backed by state traffic safety officials and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, to authorize traffic enforcement by automated camera was heard Monday.
However, legislation to study, let alone mandate the traffic infrastructure side of the equation “has never materialized,” Nick Shepack, Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Center, told state lawmakers.
Lawmakers agreed last year to create legislation “on traffic safety infrastructure that creates safety on all streets and focuses on high impact areas as well as authorizes the use of safety cameras,” Shepack said.
“We are missing the first half of the bill,” he said.
The three-hour hearing kicked off a robust discussion about repealing Nevada’s law, adopted in 1999, banning the use of speed and red light cameras. 
Senate Bill 415, heard Monday by the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, would allow local jurisdictions to use automated traffic enforcement, such as red light cameras, if they chose to do so. 
Drivers could face a $100 find for running a red light under the legislation.  
The bill would require jurisdictions that want to use cameras to conduct a 60-day public awareness campaign on automated traffic enforcement. 
For the first 30 days in use, camera-automated enforcement would only result in warnings. 
Andrew Bennett, the chair of Nevada Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety, presented amended language for the bill alongside Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill, the National Transportation Board, and Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft.
The ACLU of Nevada, the Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center and Clark County Public Defender’s officer presented a counter presentation to the bill about the concerns of automated traffic enforcement.  
They noted the use of automated enforcement across the country has been overused in low-income communities and communities of color and opens up the potential for sensitive data to be collected and shared. The legislation, as heard, still comes with too many lingering questions, they told lawmakers. 
“We view this as a half-baked proposal,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada. “This is not ready to move forward. This body routinely engages in study. We say put it to a study. If this body is so compelled, put it to a ballot question.”

McMahill told state lawmakers Monday that while he wasn’t “a proponent of big government” it was the growing number of traffic accidents, and deaths, that changed his mind. 
“I’m not a proponent, really, of traffic cameras, until the last 10 years or so,” he said. “The bottom line is that I’m sick and tired of people dying on our roadways because of the bad behavior of other drivers.”
Roughly 160 people were killed on Clark County roads last year, McMahill said. 
“We’re here today because 3,535 people have lost their lives in Nevada on our roadways over the last decade,” Bennett added. 
The growing number of deaths, he said, demanded urgency. Traffic officials previously told lawmakers during the interim session that the number of fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2022 has increased 36%. 
“The National Conference for state legislators shows that 33 states currently allow the use of this technology in all or specific situations,” Bennett said, adding that automated enforcement “saves lives.” 
“I think there are certain aspects of government that we should not privatize,” Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, chair of the Senate Growth and Infrastructure committee. “I do have some concerns that we are privatizing our law enforcement officers in enacting legislation like this, because that’s what we’re doing.”
The bill would enable local jurisdictions in setting up traffic cameras, though the Nevada Department of Transportation would be tasked with setting up enforcement procedural regulations.
People would be mailed the citation and would have 90 days to respond. They could also contest the ticket if they weren’t driving. 
The citations “are not classified as moving violations and will not impact a driver’s record or license,” Bennett said.  
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen questioned how a $100 fee outlined in the language – a fine people wouldn’t get until months after the fact – would actually prevent people from speeding or running red lights. 
“I mean 100 bucks,” Hansen said. “No demerit. No insurance notification. Because, you know, those are things when you start paying an extra 500 bucks a year, $1,000 a year … that has an impact.”
Bennett said the language was to find a balance between concerns presented by groups like the Fines and Fees Justice Center.
Hansen also questioned how many of the traffic fatalities last year where a driver ran a red light or was speeding stemmed from the driver being intoxicated or on drugs.
Bennett said he wasn’t able to get that information prior to the hearing.
Since the idea of automated enforcement gained traction in Nevada, opponents have warned that some jurisdictions across the country have used red light cameras as a revenue source. 
An amendment to the bill Bennett presented said any additional funds collected from enforcement would be allocated to cover the cost of the program. Any additional funds after that would be used exclusively for engineering improvements in that jurisdiction, he said. 
The legislation also prohibits per-ticket contracts and profit sharing with the vendors.
Nguyen said the bill needs more guardrails to prevent excessive fines and fees. 
”That money still goes to law enforcement,” she said. “It seems like a conflict of interest.”
Sponsors also amended their original bill to add a provision prohibiting governments from sharing information with immigration enforcement agencies. 
Haseebullah said the provision was “a nice gesture” but he is wary of its practical effect.
“It would require us to have information access to everything in their possession, and we don’t,” he said. “I don’t know if relying on the ACLU to put in public records requests to the same bodies hiding this information or charging us sums of money in order to get this data is an effective solution.”
Deter behavior
The bill’s opponents urged lawmakers to refocus on traffic infrastructure, including using items like roundabouts or changing the design of streets, to reduce accidents.
“You make the roads less wide,” Shepack said. “You build in buffer lanes between the crosswalks and the streets. In Vegas we have a huge problem with a bus stop being in the middle of the block. It’s 118 degrees and people have to run across four lanes of traffic. You can put in certain medians to deter this behavior.”
Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft suggested many of those ideas have been “implemented today in unincorporated Clark County and I would dare to say in the other jurisdictions who spoke today as well.”
“That doesn’t mean the work is done,” Naft said. “We have much more to do when it comes to infrastructure. There are billions of dollars we could spend on infrastructure to ensure everyone is safe in our community. Alternatively, we have this route, which does allow a path for some consequence, for some action to be taken when someone violates the law and for some accountability to be had.”

Representatives of the  Southern Poverty Law Center; Faith in Action Alabama and the League of Women Voters of Alabama urged lawmakers to consider bills that allow people to cure their absentee ballot affidavits, eliminate obstacles for people who are formerly incarcerated to regain their voting rights, and stump for the Alabama Voting Rights Act that protects voters from possible voter discrimination.
“Voting should be a simple, convenient process that allows every eligible voter to easily participate,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “But we know in Alabama, far too often, that is not the case.”

The proposals, mostly sponsored  by Democrats, have yet to garner any consideration from the Republican-dominated Legislature.
“I don’t know of any issues of people having trouble voting,” said Rep. Bob Fincher, R-Woodland, the chair of the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee in an interview Monday evening.  “Anyone who is eligible to vote in the state may register.”
The bills have stalled amid fears that states are further restricting access to the ballot box.
“I think nationally, what we are seeing, is an increasing gulf between states that are moving to restrict access to the ballot and making it harder for people to vote, and states that are doing the opposite and making it easier for people to vote, and increasing access to the ballot box,” said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan democracy rights organization.
States that have increased restrictions for voting have focused on laws that prove eligibility.
“Basically, requiring voters to provide new and burdensome documentation or paperwork requirements to prove their eligibility, so states requiring passports or birth certificates, or other documents that many Americans don’t have even if they are a U.S. citizen, or that would require some kind of cost or time to obtain,” Diaz said.
Alabama has had a photo voter ID requirement since 2014. In recent years, it has banned drop boxes for ballots and private aid for conducting elections. Last year, the Legislature approved a measure criminalizing some forms of absentee ballot assistance, a law that was partially blocked by a federal judge last fall.
Civil rights groups are monitoring two fronts, concerned with not only rules and regulations that states are imposing on voting, but also the federal government that has followed laws enacted by states.
The SAVE Act, which is currently working its way through Congress, would require people to provide another set of documentation to register to vote, such as enhanced drivers’ licenses, passports or birth certificates.
It would also hinder efforts of people to register to vote by mail and online, while increasing the frequency that states must update their voter rolls by removing people from their voter registration lists.
“Election workers could go to prison for up to five years if they help to register somebody without the correct documents, even if the registered voter is a citizen,” according to an explainer from the CLC.
“This is not going to save anything,” said Kathy Jones, president of the League of Women Voters of Alabama, at Tuesday’s rally. “It is going to disenfranchise a whole lot of people.”
President Donald Trump also issued an executive order to further restrict voter access by requiring people to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport, to register to vote. It also prohibits state election officials from counting ballots received after the election allowed by state law or having their federal funding withheld.
Diaz said that the Campaign Legal Center filed a lawsuit to challenge the president’s authority to implement additional regulations aimed at further restricting voters’ access to the ballot box.
“The constitution is very clear that the president does not have the authority to set election policies or set voter registration requirements,” Diaz said. “The states have that responsibility, and Congress has the power to set national rules by legislating. The constitution has no role for the president in the establishment of election rules.”
Among the bills that groups prioritized during the event is SB 7, sponsored by Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, called the Alabama Voting Rights Act. The bill is comprehensive meant to address several aspects of voting that have been priorities for voting rights groups.
Hatcher’s bill creates the Alabama Voting Rights Commission that would assume the role that the U.S. Department of Justice performed prior to 2013’s Shelby County v. Holder ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act requiring the U.S. Department of Justice to preclear changes to voting laws in jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices.
The bill would also allow voters to cast absentee ballots without citing a reason like illness or confinement.
It would also allow people who were released in prison to regain their voting rights automatically for crimes considered crimes of moral turpitude after they meet the conditions of their parole absent paying for court costs and fines and restitution.
“If we can have a convicted felon to be president, then why are we setting up barriers to stop people from voting,” said Gregory Scott, pastor of Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Huntsville, who spoke for Faith in Action Alabama during Tuesday’s rally. “That is hypocritical, and if Alabama is to be the kind of state it needs to be, we cannot have that kind of hypocritical work done in this Legislature.”
HB 31, sponsored by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, allows people with a disability, or those unable to read or write, to designate someone to assist them with delivering an absentee ballot application or the absentee ballot itself, to the election manager.
“I know that bill, and I believe that people with a disability should receive assistance,” Fincher said. “We are working with the Secretary of State’s Office to address that issue administratively, so that is the reason that has not been introduced.”
HB 97, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatté Hassell, D-Montgomery, allows people to cure their absentee ballot affidavit if they submit them before the election and the absentee election manager finds an error. Currently, the ballots are set aside and not counted if election officials find a defect with the affidavits.
HB 64, sponsored by Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, would make election day a federal holiday so that people are able to vote without excusing themselves from work.
Thus far, none of the bills have even been considered in their respective committees.
“I think it would give credibility to the state of Alabama,” said Terry Hamilton-Poore, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, of expanding voting rights for Faith in Action Alabama. “Right now, this state is viewed as backwards, and it is not entirely wrong in terms of our politics.”

Faulkner passed a bill in 2019 that required schools to offer computer science courses but did not require students to take the classes.
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said she wanted to know that schools are equipped to teach the classes before requiring students to take it.
“Are we sure that we have the number of teachers that would be able to teach computer science? Now once we’ve got all of that in place, then I think your bill is in order,” Moore said.
Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, echoed Moore. She said she is concerned about how artificial intelligence would be incorporated into the definition of computer science.
“So pushing this computer thing, I’m not sure the right thing,” she said. “We may be on the right track, but I think it goes beyond that.”
Faulkner said that a House Education Policy Committee substitute expanded the definition of computer science to include AI, coding languages and quantum computing. The substitute passed 98-2.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, said that he and Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, who chairs their respective Education Trust Fund committees in the House and Senate, met with State Superintendent Eric Mackey on the computer science classes. He supported the need for a loose definition of computer science.
“It’s got to be fluid, changing, whatnot. So a lot of it is dynamic,” Garrett said.

(Photo provided by Humane Society of the United States)Efforts by local governments to put a kink in the pipeline between midwest puppy mills and Nevada are being derailed by neighboring municipalities that permit retail sales of dogs and cats, say advocates of legislation that would expand the bans statewide.
The bill is sponsored by Assemblywoman Natha Anderson and was heard Tuesday by the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources.
“Eight states, including the entire West Coast and nearly 500 localities, including Clark County, Reno, North Las Vegas, and Mesquite have prohibited the sale of puppies in pet stores,” testified Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals, formerly the Humane Society of the U.S. “Assembly Bill 487 can bridge that divide and allow us to bring our nation one big step closer to that day when puppy mills must no longer exist.”
The City of Henderson allows pet sales at existing stores, while the City of Las Vegas has refused to ban sales, prompting retailers affected by the ban to move across city limits and into pet store-friendly territory. 
Regulations imposed by Las Vegas in lieu of a ban have increased transparency and “exposed just how awful the puppy mill pipeline is,” Goff told lawmakers. “It’s crucial that this should be tackled statewide, rather than a patchwork of ordinances.” 
An undercover investigation by the Humane Society released in January alleges pet stores in Southern Nevada are keeping sick puppies without seeking veterinary treatment, and in at least one case, failing to obey a law requiring regular veterinarian visits for animals for sale.
The legislative measure is named for Cindy Lou, a sick Havenese puppy kept in a pen in the employee bathroom at Puppy Heaven and allegedly denied medical care until animal officials who were tipped off the illness required the store to take her to a veterinarian, where she died, according to the investigation.
“Her story is a heartbreaking example of what happens when profit is placed above animal welfare,” testified Christy Stevens, executive director of Hearts Alive Village, who described horrific incidents of animal cruelty and neglect that were allegedly known to a Las Vegas pet store that continued to sell animals to the alleged perpetrator. “These are not isolated incidents. They are part of a systemic problem.”
Clark County’s largest shelter, the Animal Foundation, as well as the Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals support the measure. 
The legislation would permit pet stores to hold adoption events for shelters and rescues. It prohibits the sale of pets on street corners, parking lots, and other public places. A violation of the proposed law would be a misdemeanor.
The legislation would give the 15 retail stores that sell pets in Nevada a year to adjust their business model. 
The Retailers Association of Nevada is neutral on the legislation, testified executive director Bryan Wachter. 
“The vast majority of pet stores in Nevada already do not sell puppies, but rather thrive as part of the $147 billion pet products and service industry,” Goff testified. 
Pet store puppies are likely to be sick or have behavioral issues, making them more likely to land in local shelters, supporters of the measure said. 
Amy Jesse of Humane World for Animals noted a report from the Centers for Disease Control that traced a drug-resistant, multistate human infection outbreak to “puppies from breeders and distributors sold through pet stores as the outbreak source.” Of 149 retail store puppies, 95% received one or more courses of antibiotics. 
The bill is opposed by pet stores, some of which are named in the Humane Society investigation, including the owner of Petland in Henderson. 
Ken Kirkpatrick, owner of Petland in Boca Park, testified he and his staff have provided pets and peace of mind to Las Vegans since 2001 in a highly regulated environment. He predicted backyard breeding will expand. thanks to demand from families “who can’t adopt from shelters or rescues because they want a specific breed, or they need a hypoallergenic dog.”
Kirkpatrick noted a review of the Animal Foundation’s adoption list revealed 200 dogs for adoption. For a population of 2.5 million people, “it’s really not that many dogs.” 
On Tuesday, the Animal Foundation listed 370 dogs for adoption. Last year, the shelter euthanized more than 3,300 dogs, down from just under 3,900 the previous year. 
Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama, a Republican from Clark County, said her family visited a shelter recently while looking for an addition to the family “and for some reason it was just not a right fit. I wanted a smaller dog, and we ended up at a pet store.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cindylou-1024x642.png,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

College students experience food insecurity at nearly twice the rate of all American households. Photo by Grace Aigner for Minnesota Reformer. While many college students are concerned about where they’ll score a summer internship or scoping out the next good party, fourth-year Minnesota State University student Em Hodge and many people she knows have an entirely different concern: food insecurity.  
“I know a lot of students and friends I’ve worked with don’t know where their next meal is coming from,” Hodge said. “And SNAP could really, really benefit them, but they just make a little too much money,” she said, referring to the federal-state food aid program and its tight eligibility requirement for students.   
“Which is just so unfortunate,” said Hodge, a student lobbyist with Students United. 
Hodge and her fellow students are not alone. College students experience food insecurity at nearly twice the rate of all American households and have been disproportionately underserved by SNAP. 
More than one in five graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota said they worried about having enough food until they had money to buy more, the university’s 2024 College Student Health Survey found. 
Now, some Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers hope to make life a little easier for students like Hodge. With the help of Second Harvest Heartland and a university student lobbying group called Students United, the lawmakers want to loosen Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility requirements to allow more college students to enroll. 
Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St.Cloud, said current policies don’t accurately reflect the needs of today’s college students.
“There’s a very dismissive presumption that college students can survive off of ramen and Natural Light for four years, and then they’ll be fine,” said Putnam, referring to the cheap noodles and beer that have sustained many a college student. “That’s not today’s college student.”

To receive benefits, Minnesota college students must meet one federal SNAP eligibility requirement, like working 20 hours a week, having a documented mental or physical disability or caring for a child 11 years old or younger. Photo by Grace Aigner for Minnesota Reformer.
In 2021, Carolyn Litzell was a non-traditional student in her 30s with a full course load, a part-time job and an unpaid internship while paying bills and tuition. Litzell said SNAP was a bureaucratic nightmare. But she relied on it.
“Six or eight times I re-upped my SNAP, every single time it was rejected and then I would have to appeal through a legal process,” Litzell said. “Now imagine English isn’t my first language or I didn’t have people who were willing to help me get my paperwork.”
The hoops
To receive benefits, Minnesota college students must meet one federal SNAP eligibility requirement, like working 20 hours a week, having a documented mental or physical disability or caring for a child 11 years old or younger. 
Litzell said SNAP eligibility requirements are unrealistic for students.
“Every time you got a new job — and when you’re a student you get new jobs sometimes three or four times a year — you would have to report,” Litzell said. “And the reporting process is, not to be conspiratorial, but I think intentionally obtuse.”
Indeed, Sophie Wallerstedt, spokesperson for Second Harvest Heartland, said a lack of awareness that students may be eligible and the intimidating SNAP application process contribute to students’ underutilization.
What a bill could do
Putnam and lobbyists from Second Harvest and Students United attempted to expand SNAP eligibility in 2023 with a bill that allowed Minnesota state colleges and the University of Minnesota to designate their institution as a SNAP Employment and Training program, effectively making more students eligible for SNAP.
“These are resources to which people are entitled already, and they are being actively neglected,” Putnam said.
The bill passed the Legislature, but was denied by the Biden administration, and the Trump administration is unlikely to change course. 
Putnam said potential federal spending cuts to programs like SNAP — which congressional Republicans are mulling even as Elon Musk’s DOGE takes a chainsaw to the entire government — are worrisome.
Wallerstedt, the spokesperson for Second Harvest, said SNAP cuts would mean increasing strain on campus food pantries. 
The need for campus pantries
Indeed, while a SNAP eligibility expansion remains unsettled, Students United is focused on getting more funding for campus food pantries. 
The Hunger Free Campus Grant, passed in 2021, funds campus food pantries. The University of Minnesota, Mankato State University and Macalester College were among the 2024 grant recipients.
The Office of Higher Education awarded 24 schools a total of almost $450,000 as part of the Hunger Free Campus grant program in 2024.
Michelle Trumpy said state funding is essential to Nutritious U’s ability to purchase and store food. The campus pantry currently serves 1,800 students every month, 400 more students than the previous school year.
A bill introduced to the state Senate on March 13 would fund the Hunger Free Campus Grant through 2027. 
Putnam said the grant provides food and educational resources.
“You don’t see the education that travels with (the food) too, because that’s not as obvious,” Putnam said. “The nutrition discussions, the information about different resources that could be available, all of those things are great.”
Litzell said visiting Nutritious U — the University of Minnesota’s food pantry — was a comfortable experience, which is important for students who might otherwise attach shame to needing the food pantry.
“It was easy to get to, it was easy to get, the line always moved really fast, they were actually super efficient,” Litzell said. “Getting that amount of food felt good.”
Hodge said she wants to see the reliable campus food pantry at Minnesota State expand. 
“I’ve been through some phases where money is tight, so I’ll go to the food pantry,” Hodge said. 
Wallerstedt of Second Harvest Heartland said supplementing SNAP with a visit to a food shelf to get through the lean times is fine as a temporary measure, but it can’t be the only game in town. 
“It should not have to be the only thing that is available to students,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/decisions-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

After I retired I  started volunteering at a local food shelf called VEAP.
VEAP — Volunteers Enlisted to Assist People — is one of the largest food pantries in Minnesota. Last year it provided over 4.6 million pounds of food to over 250,000 Minnesotans. Almost the entire operation is driven by volunteers: scheduling appointments, sorting donations, and running pantry operations to provide food to customers. 
There are almost 500 food shelves across Minnesota, some large like VEAP, and many much smaller. Most depend heavily on volunteers and donations. 
Food shelves are supported by larger organizations called food banks — like Second Harvest Heartland and The Food Group. Food banks partner with grocery retailers, manufactures and farmers to source and warehouse food that they distribute to food shelves in communities across the state. They also depend on donations and volunteers. 
This is a remarkable system, a credit to the people that put time, energy and money into building and maintaining it. 
But right now, it is strained by an incredible increase in demand. 
Reliance on food shelves has skyrocketed since the pandemic. The number of people seeking help at VEAP has more than doubled since 2020. According to the Food Group, that reflects the same trend across the entire state. In 2024, Minnesotans made 9 million visits to food shelves.
Food inflation is certainly one driver. And the end of pandemic emergency SNAP benefits in 2023 took away a primary support — a loss of $100 a month for the average family.
A study by Second Harvest Heartland, in partnership with Wilder Research, found that 1 in 5 Minnesotans are “food insecure,” meaning they don’t have access to the food they need, usually because they can’t afford it. This includes 26% of families with children and 40% of households of color. 
The study also found that food aid — food shelves and/or SNAP benefits — helped more than half of food insecure Minnesotans have enough food to eat. That’s great; we know that we can make a difference for hungry families. 
But it is hard to read this and not ask: How can there be people without enough food in the richest country in the world? 
And be reminded that this is a question we have been asking for decades. 
The development of a broad network of food banks and food shelves started to expand rapidly around 1980. By one account, 80% of the food shelves in the U.S. in 2001 had opened since 1980. 
Why did our nation suddenly need so many food shelves after 1980? Certainly, the economy was a factor, as late 1970s stagflation gave way to a deep recession in the early 1980s. 
But it was also the year Ronald Reagan was elected president and changed the course of American social policy. 
With the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, the U.S. moved toward a more progressive approach to social policy. The highlight of this period was Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society and War on Poverty. Even Richard Nixon proposed a guaranteed family income and universal health coverage (although neither was enacted). 
Reagan stopped this progress, cutting public assistance and food stamps and other social services. 
Progress on advancing social policy has been bumpy ever since. The “Reagan Revolution” had successfully sold the idea that government was the problem. 
Forty-five years later, in our current moment, we can certainly recognize how deeply this message has sunk into the American psyche and how it continues to drive policy debates. 
And so, once again, federal funding to fight hunger is vulnerable to cuts. 
The federal government has long provided funding to states to support emergency food. It’s not a lot of money but has provided a base for the emergency system. Two funding sources have already been cut, a loss of $6.7 million in food intended for Minnesota food banks.  
More critically, of course, is SNAP formerly known as food stamps. Congress is poised to cut over $200 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years. Cutting SNAP at this level would require reducing benefits to families or cutting people completely off SNAP — or some combination of the two. 
The result will be more hunger. 
The incredible success of the emergency food system — a mostly non-profit, volunteer-driven sector — is not enough to make up for hundreds of billions of dollars. 
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try — volunteer, donate, do what you are able to do. 
But problems of this scope need public policy solutions and investments. 
In the 1980s, conservatives liked to say that President Lyndon Johnson launched a War on Poverty and poverty won.
In fact, by the late 1970s the U.S. poverty rate was half what it was in 1960, before the War on Poverty.  
To paraphrase Matthew Desmond from his book “Poverty, by America,”  did we lose the war on poverty, or did we just stop fighting?
Maybe that’s why there are hungry people in the richest country in the world.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/velveeta-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

Ron DeSantis’ penchant for political theater, full embrace of a far-right extremist agenda, and need for attention, it’s not surprising that he would attach himself to the Trump-Musk DOGE project.
Despite the utter chaos the project has created at the federal level, DeSantis recently announced the creation of a Florida version of the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) task force, which he claims will target and eliminate “waste” in state government, save taxpayers money, and “ensure accountability” in Florida.
The Florida DOGE task force will work similarly to the “department” created by President Donald Trump and led by Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who is unelected and unaccountable to the American people. Musk and his minions have orchestrated the slashing of agency budgets since Trump came back into office on Jan. 20.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried’s response to the announcement captures the absurdity of DeSantis’ action.

“Republicans have been in total control of Florida’s government for nearly 30 years, and he wants to talk about government waste?” she said.
“Ron has consistently passed the largest state budgets in Florida’s history, illegally spent millions of taxpayer dollars to run political campaigns to take down Amendments 3 & 4, and just allocated $250 million to fund his political stunt on immigration. Don’t lecture us on wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Fried argues everyone knows “this isn’t about reigning in spending — it’s about Trump endorsing Byron Donalds instead of Casey DeSantis. Maybe Ron should have considered the political consequences before he decided to run against the leader of his party for president.”
DeSantis said the DOGE team will likely shutter 70 boards and commissions this year to cut costs. Meanwhile, the task force will review 900 positions in state agencies to ascertain whether they should be cut.
His intention to have the task force “identify potential wasteful spending in college and university operations” should be viewed as dubious after he signed legislation last year that banned public colleges and universities from using taxpayer money to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
Institutional memory
The governor’s hostility towards Black Floridians and his crusade to eradicate any programs to level the social, political, economic, and business playing fields continue unabated. It’s likely that DOGE will be just another tool to eviscerate any entity deemed a threat to DeSantis’ implementation of an arch-conservative imprimatur on Florida.
There is also the fear that Florida will lose experienced civil servants who not only carry out critical government functions but also carry with them critical institutional memory. As it has played out nationally, the DOGE carousel will distract state employees from focusing on the people’s work.
If past is prologue, this political power move will increase fear among employees that they may lose their jobs, inducing paralysis among the ranks.
Most of all, Florida government’s best employees may seek greener pastures to the detriment to the state’s people.
DeSantis said the task force will use artificial intelligence to reduce “bureaucratic bloat.” He said the DOGE team will be a continuation of the cost-cutting measures he has overseen during his six years in office. The governor boasted that Florida saved $3.8 billion in last year’s budget and has paid down 41% of state debt since 2019.










DeSantis’ plan comes even though Florida has the lowest number of government employees per capita of any state, and the state has about $14.6 billion in cash reserves.


DeSantis’ plan comes even though Florida has the lowest number of government employees per capita of any state and $14.6 billion in cash reserves. Yet DeSantis is looking to slash 740 full-time jobs and scrap as many as 900 more related “off-the-books” positions.
Democrats pushed back by noting that Florida already has in place a voter-approved government efficiency task force created in 2006 that carried “an almost identical mandate;” Florida DOGE therefore itself is an example of unnecessary spending. The effort is really an attempt to flatter Trump and Musk to restore DeSantis to his party’s good graces.
GOP pushback
If Floridians are lucky, the significant pushback verbalized by the leaders of both of Florida’s Republican-supermajority legislative chambers may end up with DeSantis’ cockamamie plan being tossed to the trash pile.
  Sen. Ben Albritton via Florida Senate
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
“Let’s focus on what matters. Let’s pass actual reforms rather than symbolic gestures,” Daniel Perez, the Florida House speaker, told members on the legislative session’s opening day. “Let’s repeal government programs instead of reshuffling them. Let’s swing for the fences and not just try to get on base.”
Perez turned the knife a little deeper when he said that “DeSantis, a self-styled fiscal conservative, benefited from a 70% budget increase for the executive office of the governor over his six years in office.”
Senate President Ben Albritton, a member of the existing efficiency taskforce, said in remarks to the Senate that he was proud that Florida already “has a great framework for accountability,” and that he and other lawmakers had made a substantive number of recommendations “to improve flexibility [and] simplify processes.”
“The fact is we are a state and nation of laws that should be created by elected officials accountable to the people who elected them, not appointed professional staff,” he said.
None of this may matter though, because DeSantis has his eyes firmly set on running for the White House in 2028, which necessitates rebuilding the frayed ties with Trump and his loyal supporters, as well as positioning his wife Casey to run for governor when he sets down in 2027.

Rick Brattin of Harrisonville speaks in May 2024 during the Freedom Caucus filibuster blocking approval of provider taxes essential to funding Medicaid (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).In the spring of 2023, efforts were underway to put the question of restoring abortion access to Missouri voters. Abortion-rights supporters geared up to collect the roughly 171,000 signatures required to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
Per the state’s initiative petition process, then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft wrote a summary of their proposed constitutional amendment. A staunch abortion opponent then running for governor, Ashcroft drafted the first part of his summary of the petition to say: “Do you want to amend the Missouri Constitution to: allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth.”
It was not what the drafters had in mind. They took him to court — and won.
A judge nixed Ashcroft’s summary and wrote a new one.
A Republican-sponsored bill that has cleared the state Senate and received a House committee hearing Tuesday would make it more difficult for judges to rewrite a secretary of state’s ballot summary.
“To me this is a gross overstepping of the judiciary branch,” state  Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville and the bill sponsor, said at Tuesday’s hearing.
In Brattin’s opinion, shared by opponents to abortion rights, the courts wrote a summary slanted in favor of the initiative petition that would become Amendment 3, ultimately passed by voters last November.
Senate Bill 22 allows a group to appeal the secretary of state’s summary. The court can make recommendations, but the secretary of state must revise the language within seven days
If the court finds that summary unfair, the secretary gets five days to write another draft. This process can happen one last time, and upon third revision the secretary gets just three days. Only then, if the court still finds the summary unfair, can a judge rewrite it. The back-and-forth process must take place on a set timeline prior to the general election.
Brattin’s original bill eliminated the court’s ability to rewrite a ballot summary, he said at the committee hearing, but he worked with Senate Democrats to amend it.
“This was (a) compromise,” Brattin said.
For opponents of the bill, the timeline would make it nearly impossible to oppose the secretary of state’s ballot language. The process would need to play out more than 70 days before the election.
“If the time runs out, the challenge is extinguished, and it seems to me like whatever the last language is would stand, even if the court still thinks it’s not fair,” said state Rep. Eric Woods, a Kansas City Democrat.
Sam Lee, a veteran anti-abortion lobbyist, argued courts can expedite cases related to an election. He spoke on behalf of Campaign Life Missouri and testified in support of the measure along with a representative from Missouri Right to Life.
Groups including the League of Women Voters of Missouri, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and the Missouri AFL-CIO testified in opposition to the measure. Many voters echoed Woods’ concerns about the feasibility of the proposed timeline.
“What if today our Secretary of State was a Democrat?” asked Ron Berry, a lobbyist for Missouri Jobs with Justice and a former staffer for Democratic Secretary of State Robin Carnahan. “Would we be here today discussing this bill?”

(Getty Images)Early literacy forms the foundation on which a child’s academic and life success is built. Extensive research shows that children who achieve reading proficiency by third grade are more likely to graduate high school, pursue higher education, and secure stable employment. In contrast, those who struggle with reading at this critical stage often encounter greater obstacles both academically and in life.
As Indiana works to improve early literacy rates, the latest Indiana Reading Evaluation and Determination (IREAD-3) results highlight both progress and persistent gaps demanding urgent attention.
Each year, Indiana’s third graders take the IREAD-3 assessment, which evaluates foundational reading skills such as phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension. In the 2023-2024 school year, 82.5% of students demonstrated literacy proficiency—an increase from 81.9% in 2023. While this improvement is encouraging, overall proficiency levels remain below pre-pandemic rates, underscoring the lingering impact of COVID-19 on early education.
More concerning are the disparities found among student populations. Twenty-seven of Indiana’s 92 counties had proficiency rates below the state average, 5 more counties than in 2023. Special education students had the lowest overall proficiency, with a 31.1 percentage point gap compared to their general education peers, and English learners’ proficiency was over 21 percentage points lower than that of non-English learners. Students from low-income households also showed lower proficiency rates, highlighting the impact of economic disparities on early literacy.
Early childhood experiences
Literacy development begins long before a child enters kindergarten. The first five years are a critical period of brain development, shaping cognitive, social, and emotional growth. High-quality early learning environments, rich language exposure, and supportive relationships with caregivers are essential for early literacy success.
Unfortunately, many Indiana children face barriers to these experiences. Approximately 42% of children under age three live in households with incomes below twice the federal poverty level, and 18% of children under five live in poverty. Financial hardship often brings additional stressors, such as food insecurity and unstable housing, which can hinder early learning. Chronic absenteeism—heightened by the pandemic—remains a significant concern, particularly for students from low-income families, who may face transportation challenges or other obstacles to consistent attendance.
Despite these challenges, Indiana has made strides in providing early intervention services, with high participation rates in developmental screenings, early intervention programs, and home-visiting services, all of which positively impact school readiness and long-term achievement.
Expanding Access to Quality Early Learning
Access to high-quality early childhood education is a proven strategy to foster literacy and close literacy gaps. Research shows children attending such programs demonstrate stronger reading and math skills in later grades.
The state’s On My Way Pre-K program provides access to high-quality preschool for low-income four-year-olds. However, Indiana’s funding for such programs remains among the lowest in the nation. Furthermore, many children, particularly in rural areas, lack access to quality preschool programs. Investment in early education systems benefits not just individual children but also strengthens the state’s workforce and economic future.
Literacy Development
Indiana has taken promising steps to enhance literacy through innovative programs and strategic investments.
A $9.5 million investment from Lilly Endowment Inc. supports literacy through out-of-school time (OST) programs. Led by the Indiana Afterschool Network, this initiative reinforces in-school learning through before-school, after-school, and summer opportunities. Using the Science of Reading framework, the program strengthens word recognition and language comprehension. Launching in 2025, the initiative will provide grants, professional development, and workforce credentials for OST staff to ensure high-quality literacy programming.
Another program having a positive impact on literacy is the Imagination Library of Indiana, which fosters a love of reading among young learners by ensuring access to free monthly books. Through Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, children receive high-quality books at no cost, helping them build home libraries and develop early literacy skills. Research has validated this program’s effectiveness in improving reading readiness and inspiring a culture of literacy in families across the state.
Reach Out and Read Indiana is another evidence-based program dedicated to giving young children a foundation for success. Integrating books into pediatric care, this model provides training and resources to pediatric clinicians to promote shared reading and meaningful family interactions. Research has shown that building strong foundational relationships through reading together can mitigate the negative effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Reach Out and Read strengthens early literacy and relational health, helping children develop resilience and lifelong learning habits.
These initiatives, together with current state efforts, demonstrate Indiana’s commitment to enhancing early literacy through both in-school and out-of-school learning opportunities.
Indiana’s Future
Improving literacy outcomes requires taking a multi-faceted approach, with support beginning in early childhood and running through elementary education. In 2022, Indiana set a goal for 95% of third graders to achieve reading proficiency on IREAD-3 by 2027. The following year, the Indiana General Assembly adopted the Science of Reading as the foundation for literacy instruction. In 2024, a bill enforcing retention for third graders not proficient in reading was passed and came into effect for the 2024-2025 school year.
Despite these efforts, too many young Hoosiers lack foundational reading skills. As families, teachers, youth workers, clinicians, local and state elected leaders, and employers who want to see our children succeed consider next steps, we must work together.
A strong commitment to evidence-based action can transform early literacy in Indiana. Doing so will equip all our students, regardless of background, with the foundational reading skills essential to the future of our children, workforce, and communities.

Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, leads an energy committee on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)More than a billion dollars worth of government incentives to boost rural Hoosier broadband access could get tangled in the utility pole attachment fight between Indiana’s electricity providers and telecommunications companies — prompting a major potential amendment and several hostile exchanges at a Tuesday committee hearing.
“For three years of my life, I have been trying to get the utilities and the telecoms to agree,” the committee’s frustrated leader, Rep. Ed Soliday, began. “… And so, we now are here.”
“The loser in all of this is the rural person who needs broadband,” he said. “… I’m going to give out phone numbers of who to call when they come to me and say their children are going to McDonald’s to do their homework.”
Senate Bill 502 is lawmakers’ attempt to mediate.
Communities struggle to get connected, despite billions in broadband investment

For now, it would require telecommunications companies to “prove to you that there is a problem,” AT&T Indiana President Bill Soards told a corresponding Senate committee in February. His and other companies would submit information on their attachment requests to the Indiana Broadband Office quarterly until July 2030.
But a detailed amendment from Soliday, R-Valparaiso, would strike the reporting requirements and instead set deadlines to push both provider types toward collaboration — or face the consequences. If a pole owner’s noncompliance causes a telecommunications company to lose government funding for a broadband project, the owner could owe the company $25,000.
The committee didn’t take a decision on the edits Tuesday. It will consider the legislation again next week.
“Some of you are concerned about the amendment. Let me say this: it can get a lot worse,” Soliday warned. He later threatened to raise it to $250,000.
“We need to solve the problem. All the creative solutions to get around (or) away from this — I will devote my entire life to getting this done.”
Pivotal investments
Over the last four years, Indiana has poured $350 million into rural access to modern high-speed internet, according to bill author Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington. The state was also allocated nearly $870 million in 2023, as part of a $43 billion federal “internet for all” initiative; an estimated 150,000 Hoosier addresses are eligible, per Indiana Chief Broadband Office Steve Cox. The office is still working on a spending proposal.
Broadband providers contend that pole owners — like electric utilities — are hindering progress.
In February’s Senate committee hearing, Spectrum parent Charter Communications reported that its successful pole attachment applications averaged a nearly 400-day wait for approval. But thousands of pending applications have languished for about 500 days, on average.

Electric utilities cite incomplete and inaccurate telecommunications applications as primary causes of delay. They maintain that illegal or improperly done attachments risk damaging the state’s electric infrastructure — dubbed the “backbone for the broadband rollout,” by Michael Charbonneau, government relations head for the Indiana Electric Cooperatives.
“We have worked in good faith with other stakeholders,” Charbonneau told the committee, “to develop a framework for processing pole attachments related to broadband grant funding.”
His organization opposed the amendment, citing “significant” financial penalties, to the chagrin of lawmakers disappointed by slow progress.
“We’ve got the money to do it. So it just baffles me that, in that whole time frame, industry has not come together and figured out how to do this,” said Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie.
Cooperatives berated
Soliday was more aggressive.
“You know what I think, Mr. Charbonneau? You don’t want a solution!” he asserted. “You’re in the business of broadband, aren’t you? Aren’t you? … You are competing with the broadband companies. Are you, or are you not?”
Charbonneau said 27 of his organization’s 38 members have some involvement, generally starting a decade ago, “because someone had to deliver broadband to rural Indiana.”
He pushed back on the allegations, saying, “We want rural Indiana to succeed, and it needs broadband and electricity to do so.”
Charbonneau stood before the committee for more than thirty minutes. Questions about the amendment, attachment requests, contracts and delays repeatedly lapsed into heated exchanges — prompting audible gasps from some audience members.
As lawmakers neared caucus time, Soliday said they’d continue discussions next week “because, what I heard you say in your testimony today is that, by Oct. 1, it is impossible for the REMCs (rural electric membership cooperatives) to agree to any type of timeline or performance standards with the telecoms. …”
“No, it is not —” Charbonneau began.
“Then, you can. It’s a binary question. Yes or no?” Soliday pressed.
After several more exchanges, Charbonneau said he was concerned less about the deadline and more that all parties were working “in good faith.” He sought a solution without fines.

“What you’d really like is no accountability, and we can continue with this … indefinitely. That’s what I’m hearing you say,” Soliday said, as Charbonneau reiterated his aversion to the penalties.
“Three. Years. And we wind up with storytelling every time. We need a solution. So if your answer is (that) it can’t be done, you shouldn’t even be here,” Soliday added.
“Mr. Chairman, I’m not saying it can’t be done. I’m here to say we oppose this amendment,” Charbonneau replied.
The back-and-forth continued until Soliday dubbed the REMCs the “number-one obstructionist.”
“Wow,” Charbonneau said.
“And that is a fact that I can document. And here we go again,” Soliday concluded. “So, (I’ll) be happy to see you all next Tuesday. Do you have a different amendment? How many hours have we met? All I get is mush. Thank you for your testimony. … With that, we are adjourned.”
Indiana’s broadband problems may go beyond state lines, however.
The federal broadband effort is falling behind schedule, Stateline has reported. And, under President Donald Trump’s administration, it faces an overhaul that could push lucrative contracts toward Elon Musk — the world’s richest man and a top Trump adviser — according to the National Public Radio. One of the furthest-along states, West Virginia, is reworking its proposal to better align with the administration’s desires, per Broadband Breakfast.

(Mia Maldonado / Idaho Capital Sun)As rent prices continue to rise within the Treasure Valley, a Boise-based nonprofit, Jesse Tree, successfully prevented eviction for 1,500 families in 2024. 
Jesse Tree’s mission is to prevent eviction and homelessness in the Treasure Valley. It provides financial assistance, case management and educational resources to families at risk of eviction. In February, it released its annual report highlighting the demand for rental assistance in 2024.
“We’re not just handing out a check and sending folks on their way,” Jesse Tree Grants and Communications Manager Dona Ochoa told the Idaho Capital Sun. “We’re providing education and support through the process with actual social work.”
While it successfully kept thousands of Idahoans housed, more Idaho families are relying on Jesse Tree’s help than the nonprofit can reach. 
Since 2020, Jesse Tree has seen a 132% increase in rental assistance applications. And in 2024, it helped 28% of those applicants through the eviction process. It could not help everyone because of waitlist limitations and grant requirements, Ochoa said. In those cases, Jesse Tree can provide other resources and referrals to individuals, even if they do not qualify for financial help.

Highlights from the report show in 2024 there were: 

1,615 eviction court filings in Ada County 
605 eviction court filings in Canyon County
3,608 applications from families facing eviction
$1.7 million in funds distributing to Idaho families, or about $150,000 distributed each month to keep clients housed


If you are facing eviction or struggling to pay rent, contact Jesse Tree’s Tenant Resource Center at 208-383-9486 between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 

 Sustaining services despite loss in federal funding

Jesse Tree at the end of 2022 lost millions of dollars in federal grants as COVID-19 funding was phased out. 
“As the need for our services continues to grow, the loss of funding makes it harder than ever to meet increasing demand,” Executive Director Ali Rabe said in the report. “Our ongoing ability to keep families safely housed is at risk.”
At the beginning of 2023, Jesse Tree had to cut its budget by 51% while sustaining its services, Ochoa said. But for the first time since at least 2018, Jesse Tree secured more private funding than government funding in 2024 — and it is preparing to continue that trend. 
“We do anticipate shifts in funding, considering what’s been happening with the current term,” Ochoa said, referring to federal grant cuts happening under the Trump administration. 
Despite federal funding cuts, Jesse Tree received $1 million in private funding in 2024.

 Preventing eviction prevents long-term homelessness

Ochoa said Jesse Tree’s ultimate goal is to prevent eviction, because an eviction record is permanent and creates barriers to accessing future housing.
Boise and Nampa had the highest number of evictions filed last year, Ochoa said.
“As folks are displaced from more expensive areas, moving costs are always a thing to consider and it leads to folks being stretched a lot more thin in Meridian, Caldwell, Nampa — the places further from their workplaces,” Ochoa said. 
Ochoa said anyone can seek information from the nonprofit’s Tenant Resource Center.
“If they just need information on Idaho’s eviction process, if they want understanding on resources they can reach out to, or if they just need to talk through options with somebody, we encourage folks to contact us,” Ochoa said.

But she worries all of his progress could be jeopardized if he loses his Medicaid coverage.

“So the fear of any of that going away? It’s a terrible thought.”
Moore is the CEO of the national Angelman Syndrome Foundation, pushing at the state and federal levels to protect Medicaid from potential changes that could disrupt coverage for the millions of Hoosiers enrolled in the government insurance program. She, along with roughly 200 others from all over the state, gathered at the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to protect Medicaid — many explicitly targeting Senate Bill 2, a proposal that would establish work requirements for some beneficiaries. 
Still, Moore was quick to note Jackson’s happy nature and preschool-like wonder, feeling “infuriated” whenever someone suggests that Medicaid’s services should be limited in a way that might exclude her son. 
Moore wouldn’t be impacted by Senate Bill 2 directly, since Jackson is covered by another Medicaid program, but she and others worry that provisions like quarterly checks could carry over. 
“Managing my son’s complex needs is already a full-time job. Now, imagine asking families like mine to complete repetitive and confusing paperwork just to maintain the basic needs he deserves,” Moore told the rally crowd. “This is not only wrong, this is dangerous … Indiana already faces serious gaps when we care for individuals with disabilities. Removing access to Medicaid will only widen that gap and it will cost lives.”
 More on Senate Bill 2

Senate Bill 2 primarily focuses on the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers moderate-to-low-income Hoosiers. As currently written, the bill has nearly a dozen exceptions to work requirements for HIP enrollees, such as caregiving, having a disability or volunteering. 
But advocates like Tracey Hutchings-Goetz, an organizer and policy director with Hoosier Action, predict that as many as 150,000 Hoosiers could lose their HIP coverage if work requirements were established. If work requirements were implemented nationwide, some estimate 5 million adults could lose their coverage.

Providers like Allison Case, a physician with HealthNet in Indianapolis, shared her concerns about implementing a barrier for her patients, many of whom are HIP members at the federally qualified health center. 
“The majority of these patients have jobs but still struggle to make ends meet … these are people who are often one setback away from a major crisis,” said Case. 
She described a patient, dubbed “Mary,” who had a job but needed HIP to get treatment for her diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and depression. She briefly lost her coverage and Case reported losing touch with her, meaning Mary didn’t get her needed health care. 
“Finally, months later, we were able to get a hold of her … (but) she’d had multiple trips to the ER. She had run out of her medications,” Case said. “She had been in the hospital with life-threatening hyperglycemia, which would have been prevented if she had had her insulin.”

Being so sick made Mary miss work and Mary worried that she’d lose her job, according to Case. 
“This is one example of what happens when people lose their Medicaid coverage: they get sicker,” Case said. “They can lose their jobs; they can lose their housing … 
“It costs the state more money when people are sicker and use the hospitals as a primary care clinic, rather than clinics like mine and it stresses an overwhelmed health care system. SB 2 will result in more people like Mary suffering,” Case continued.
Cuts to Medicaid could also have a disproportionate impact on the state’s rural hospitals, which cover populations that are more likely to rely on the government insurance program.
Case and others rallying to protect Medicaid pointed to the bill’s fiscal note, which projects that work requirements and quarterly eligibility checks will cost the state money because of the additional administrative workload. Additionally, the federal government funds 90% of HIP — and the state uses provider and cigarette taxes to pay for the remaining 10%.
But that funding mechanism could also be threatened, part of the bill author’s stated motivation to revisit the program. On the federal level, the current budget includes cuts that would impact the $880 billion spent on Medicaid, with a particular target on Medicaid expansion populations like HIP enrollees.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. In 2018, 61% of Idahoans voted in favor of a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in Idaho. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
 U.S. House Republicans push budget plan requiring Medicaid cuts to cover GOP-supported tax cuts

U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states, including Idaho, requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
 How did work requirements for Medicaid work out for Arkansas?

In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

The agency is now undertaking a once-per-decade strategic planning process. This offers a critical opportunity for every Idahoan that enjoys what native wildlife brings to our lives. It’s now time for Idaho to embrace bold, reimagined conservation strategies that confront the growing landscape-level threats common to all wildlife species that call Idaho home.

Since the late 1800s, when many species were taken to the brink of extinction, game animal populations have largely rebounded thanks to taxes on equipment purchased by hunters and anglers. While effective for a tiny number of species like deer and elk, this approach is now woefully inadequate to address the enormous challenges Idaho’s native wildlife face today.
 Threats like habitat fragmentation, invasive species and disease, sprawl and climate change cannot be confronted by the same management mindset that worked for a handful of game species disappearing from overexploitation. Instead, all Idaho’s voices must come together to seek lasting conservation solutions.
Over 95% of Idaho’s species are not hunted, trapped or fished. Yet, only 3% of Fish and Game’s budget is allocated for their conservation.
This disproportionate focus on game species neglects the vast majority of Idaho’s wildlife, including pollinators, amphibians, birds, most mammals and more. It also shirks the fundamental mission of Fish and Game — to manage ALL of Idaho’s wildlife on behalf of ALL Idahoans. As stewards, Fish and Game needs to give nongame species a bigger seat at the table.
To truly protect Idaho’s diversity of wildlife, Idaho Fish and Game must embark on a new era of holistic conservation. This pivot would be smart for wildlife and smart for Idaho. 
Idahoans connect with wildlife differently than when Fish and Game was created. Idaho’s wildlife is a public trust resource to be managed by Fish and Game for the benefit of all Idahoans — not just hunters and anglers. Managing for a broader range of conservation values will also make Fish and Game a more resilient, contemporary, science-driven wildlife agency — not only for this decade’s strategic plan, but for generations to come.
Reimagining a funding model for Idaho Fish and Game based on revenues contributed by a wider diversity of Idahoans is also part of that evolution. Idaho Fish and Game’s budget has doubled in the last 20 years, yet nongame funds have been reduced by 50%. 
The current system, which still relies heavily on hunting and fishing revenues, is inadequate for the stewardship of all wildlife. We wish that money for nongame species from tax check-offs and license plate sales were enough, but it’s not. 
By diversifying funding sources, we can ensure all Idaho’s wildlife is taken care of. Nationwide, states are beginning to adopt innovative funding tools that enjoy popular support. Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul, we need to grow a bigger conservation pie.
Idaho’s wildlife belongs to all of us. Let’s imagine a brighter future for all the species we love — in all their shapes and sizes. 
Idahoans can submit comments to Idaho Fish and Game until April 15. 
All wildlife enthusiasts — whether you fish, hunt, birdwatch, or simply appreciate nature — must collaborate on conservation priorities that protect Idaho’s immense wildlife heritage. The future of wildlife in our state cannot and must not be taken for granted. 
With leadership from Fish and Game, the entire conservation community can ensure the agency fulfills all its wildlife stewardship responsibilities and finds new funds to carry them out. It’s time for Idaho Fish and Game to work with all wildlife advocates and build a stronger, more resilient wildlife management agency for everyone.

In the next room, brain injury patients work with therapists to relearn daily skills, such as cooking in the center’s full-sized therapy kitchen.
USC plans to build $350M neurological hospital touted as first in Southeast

Upstairs, patients participate in video game-like therapy supported by a robotic arm. Fitted with sensors that measure grip strength and arm movement, therapists use the machine to measure patient improvements.
And along the way, patients participate in medical research studies, such as being fitted with sensors that use electric currents to stimulate swallowing.
It’s this type of rehabilitation center the University of South Carolina hopes to recreate, though on a smaller scale, in the Palmetto State. The university would couple this with a specialized neurology and neurosurgery hospital designed to handle the state’s most severe stroke, dementia and brain injury cases.
“What we’re trying to do here is not about the university, it’s about the people of South Carolina,” USC President Michael Amiridis told the SC Daily Gazette. “Our rates of death, in terms of brain trauma and in terms of stroke, are amongst the worst in the country.”
Strokes, which occur when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, were the fifth-highest cause of death in South Carolina in 2022, when 3,100 people died of the blockage. That year, the state had the tenth-highest stroke death rate nationwide, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To make the proposed $350 million academic hospital and rehab center happen, the university is seeking $150 million from the Legislature, which the House included in its budget plan for the coming fiscal year.
Senate budget writers will hear from USC about the proposal Wednesday.
The remainder would come from reserve funds currently held by the state’s Medicaid agency, according to USC spokesman Jeff Stensland.

Amiridis saw firsthand the benefits of such a project during his nearly seven years as chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago.
The Windy City’s university medical school and teaching hospital had a century-long history of neurosurgery, boasting some of the country’s leading experts in the field.
While USC’s own medical school doesn’t have the same storied history, Amiridis sees potential to grow the college’s prestige by tapping into new technologies, including robotic surgery.
“A lot of the changes that we have seen in medicine, and especially in the neurosurgery area, has to do with equipment, has to do with technology,” Amiridis said.
Similar to how USC works with companies, such as Siemens, Yaskawa robotics and Nephron Pharmaceuticals, it would form working research partnerships with the businesses that produce this new medical equipment.
Amiridis also predicts, because of its narrow focus, the teaching hospital will be “a destination of choice for physicians or graduates of medical schools who want to be neurosurgeons or neurologists,” helping grow the pool of neurological doctors in the state.
The need for more neuro expertise became evident to Amiridis and other university leadership over the past two years as the school created a network of clinics across the state to diagnose Alzheimer’s and dementia patients and increase access to care. Also in the works is USC’s $30 million Brain Health Center, an outpatient treatment and research facility expected to open this fall.
Through that process, USC researchers learned, the national average wait time for patients to get an appointment with a neurologist is one month. In South Carolina, the wait is nine months.
“You think you have Alzheimer’s disease. You want to see a doctor, and they tell you, ‘Great, we will see you next year,'” Amiridis said. “You can imagine how people feel about it, and how much we are losing.”
The project also has the support of the Alzheimer’s Association South Carolina chapter.
“South Carolina has been deemed a neurology desert, ranking among five states with the most significant projected gap between the available neurology workforce and the health needs of people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias in 2025,” Ashton Houghton, the chapter’s executive director, said in a statement. “Institutional advancements within the Palmetto State, such as USC’s proposed neurological hospital, can play an important part in expanding access to neurological care.”
USC’s plans also go beyond the critical initial treatment needed to save a stroke victim’s life.
“What happens next is extremely important as well,” Amiridis said. “You survived, but then we have to deal with the quality of life. And that in many of these cases, the difficult cases, takes a lot of time in terms of rehabilitation.”
If built, the hospital and rehab center would be the first of its kind in the Southeast.
“It doesn’t exist in the state of South Carolina, a facility like this. And the result of this is that the people who have the ability, the financial ability, go out of state, which is not acceptable in my opinion,” Amiridis said. “Those who don’t, they cannot go out of state, they have a significantly more difficult life after the event that they had with the brain.”
USC building $30M brain health center for Alzheimer’s, dementia treatment

Outside of Chicago, research-based hospitals and neurological rehab centers are located in major cities such as Phoenix, Seattle, Boston and Baltimore. Yale University is building one in New Haven, Connecticut.
USC’s plans call for 112 to 140 beds in a 250,000 to 300,000-square-foot facility to be built next to the university’s future, $300 million School of Medicine in downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District.
According to Amiridis, once built, the hospital and center would be financially self-supporting. Research would be reliant on federal funds from the National Institutes of Health, the leading source of medical research dollars in the country.
While the distribution of those funds has been called into question under proposed cuts by the Trump Administration, Amiridis said he is optimistic a compromise will be reached as the policy changes make their way through the court system.
USC expects to cut the ribbon on the medical school in summer 2027.
If the Legislature approves the funding, Amiridis said he would like to see the neurological hospital open a year later.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-512298231-300x200-1.jpg,,,2025-04-02 07:02:39.557458

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A jam-packed agency bill became even more behemoth and wide-reaching on Tuesday after a Senate committee crammed in dozens of other provisions that largely deal with local taxes.
The move drew a range of questions from Democrats, all of whom voted against the merge. Some Republicans were also hesitant — and a GOP budget leader was opposed altogether. 
House Bill 1427, now more than 150 pages in length, was originally focused on Department of Local Government and Finance (DLGF) matters.

Embedded in the underlying legislation was language around DLGF rule-making, as well as administrative policy changes for various local taxes and assessments.
But a massive amendment approved by the Senate tax committee wrapped in all or parts of three other bills: House Bill 1080 and Senate Bill 304, dealing with innkeeper’s and food and beverage taxes, and Senate Bill 290, which mostly addresses local property tax levies.
Multiple other new changes and provisions — like for professional sports and convention center developments — were additionally included.
The amended bill advanced 8-5 to the full chamber, despite unfavorable votes from Democrats and top Republican Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka.
Sen. Eric Bassler, R-Washington, one of the bill’s Senate sponsors, discussed the amendment before the tax committee and expressed concerns, too. Because he is not a member of the committee, the senator did not participate in Tuesday’s vote.
“I’m always a little bit leery to have substantive policy changes for the state in agency bills. If the state is going to make a policy change, I’d rather those bills kind of be standalone language,” Bassler said.
“I think that’s even more so in this bill, because this is a 117-page amendment to a 79-page bill, and it deals with literally dozens and dozens of dozens of issues,” he continued. “I think we need to be very careful when we’re starting to change state policy in such a complicated bill.”
‘Substantial’ amendment prompts questions
Democratic Sen. Andrea Hunley, of Indianapolis, raised questions about a child care facility portion of the amendment that would create a partial property tax exemption for employers who provide child care for their employees on company property.
Hunley worried that the tax benefit would do little to increase services for parents, given it only applies to care for children under the age of six. Child care facilities that do not have a formal agreement with a business also would not qualify.
“To me, it’s not really solving the child care issue that we have … but it’s really about subsidizing businesses to provide a service to their own employees,” Hunley said.

“There’s so much in here dealing with taxes that are going to impact our local communities. And that has been a theme this session, in a variety of ways, and in a variety of pieces of legislation,” she added. “We have to think about — not just these pieces of legislation in isolation — but the myriad of ways that we are impacting locals with these policy changes.”
Mishler further took issue with a section on “professional sports development areas,” or PSDAs.
Those areas can already capture millions of dollars per year in tax revenue from sports facilities, hotels and other commercial properties fund infrastructure improvements and new sports-related developments.
Under the bill, cities that are located in a county with at least four cities — each with a population of at least 40,000 — would additionally be able to create special sports-related tax districts. Up to $2 million collected each year from the tax area could be invested in city-owned facilities that are used for “practice or competitive sporting events.”
“The PSDAs in here — those are usually budget discussions, because they reduce revenue,” Mishler said. “So, I’m a little irritated because I’ve been working with these groups on the investments that they’re bringing in there, and I feel like they just circumvented the system, went around, and just threw it in a bill.”
Bill author Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw, told Mishler in response that he would be “happy to take anything out of this bill that you would like, because it’s kind of unwieldy.”
Mishler, the Senate Republican budget leader, foreshadowed possible changes to that language but did not provide details.
Contention around retirement community exemptions
Also in contention was a piece of the amendment that sets criteria for continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), small house health facilities and residential care facilities” to qualify for tax exemptions.
Bartholomew County Assessor Ginny Whipple maintained that CCRCs should not qualify for exemptions “without going through the normal channels” already in place for properties.
Such senior living communities offer a range of services and care levels, from independent living apartments to assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, all under one roof.  
Currently, CCRCs can file for tax exemptions with the local property tax assessment board, whose members “vet their information and decide, on a local basis, who pays more taxes and who pays less” Whipple explained. She held that CCRC exemptions “should be a local matter, decided on the merits of each case.”










It's a step too far, in my estimation, for county assessors to take policy decisions as their purview.


– Senate tax committee chairman Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle


“I think each of these CCRCs are unique and individual. One size does not fit all. This bill would give them a free ride, while other folks over 65, paying their fair share, would not have that same advantage,” Whipple emphasized. “It would increase the taxes for those elders — because any time you carve out a special interest group, then you increase taxes for other taxpayers.”
Committee chairman Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, gave a cold reply.
“I think there are two roles for elected officials: some elected officials are in the administrative, policy-setting role, and others are ministerial. The problem I have with assessors dipping their toe into policy issues — as I see assessors as ministerial functions in counties — yours is merely to execute the law as it’s presented to you,” Holdman said. “We appreciate your position, but you are not a policymaker in the county, according to my rules. … It’s a step too far, in my estimation, for county assessors to take policy decisions as their purview.”
Sen. Chris Garten, also on the tax committee, doubled down.
“I feel like we have a lot of assessors who are flippant. … Part of the issue we’re seeing is we’ve got elected assessors statewide — that when taxpayers call them to try to have a pragmatic conversation about property tax assessments — they flippantly respond and say, ‘Property taxes aren’t our issue. Call your state legislators,” Garten said. “The majority of assessors … should be focused on the administrative functions of the job, and not policy.”

Known in Oklahoma as SoonerCare and SoonerSelect, Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income Oklahomans, including pregnant women, children, elderly Oklahomans, people with disabilities, veterans and families in need. 
More than 900,000 Oklahomans — nearly 1 in 4 — depend on Medicaid to access the medical and behavioral health care they need.
As an OB-GYN with decades of experience caring for women and families in Oklahoma, I’ve seen firsthand what these programs have provided for so many families. 
Medicaid pays for 52% of Oklahoma births and covers 47% of all Oklahoma children. Thanks to Medicaid, I’ve seen expectant mothers receive access to critical prenatal care and postpartum support they couldn’t have afforded otherwise, ensuring better health outcomes for both moms and babies.
Medicaid plays a vital role in supporting the health and future of Oklahoma children. Children enrolled in Medicaid miss fewer school days, are more likely to graduate high school and become healthier adults. In a state where nearly half of our children rely on Medicaid, this is a lifeline we can’t afford to lose.
Every year, Oklahoma receives $7 billion from Medicaid, 68% of the federal funding sent to our state. Think of it as an investment that pays dividends through health care savings and continued reinvestment in the community through salaries, taxes and the purchase of goods and services. Patients on Medicaid who have access to primary and preventative care services are less likely to end up in the ER, where health care costs are far more expensive.
Losing even a fraction of Oklahoma’s Medicaid funding would create a substantial gap for our state and send a tidal wave through our interconnected health care system. When one part of the system fails, the issue doesn’t disappear — the burden is simply shifted elsewhere. 
Cutting Medicaid wouldn’t just hurt patients; it could be detrimental to access to care in our state. These funds are a vital lifeline for rural hospitals, many of which are struggling to keep their doors open. Further cuts could strike a fatal blow to these hospitals, negatively affecting not only the health of these communities but also their economy, as many potential employers consider health care resources when expanding into new areas. 
We can’t overlook the hardworking physicians who would take a hit if Medicaid is cut. Many of those who serve a larger number of Medicaid patients — such as pediatricians, OB-GYNS, psychiatrists and family doctors — work on slim margins, and if Medicaid is cut, doctors could be forced to close their practices altogether.
The health of our state is worth protecting. Continuing to invest in Medicaid is the best way to ensure Oklahomans receive the care they deserve.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

(Photo: Angela Dennis)The Trump administration on Monday abruptly suspended an estimated $8 million in federal grant funding that provides family planning, cancer screenings and preventative health care to low-income Tennesseans.
More than 30,000 Tennesseans have accessed healthcare through the impacted organizations since late 2023.
Planned Parenthood announced that nine of its affiliates — including the affiliate that funds Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi — were notified that funding under the Title X grant program is suspended until further notice. 
A spokesperson for the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated Tuesday that it is “concerned about the compliance of several awardees” receiving a combined $27.5 million in Title X funds. The department is assessing all Title X grant recipients for compliance with federal law and President Donald Trump’s executive orders. No final determinations have been made.
The Title X program has supported affordable basic health care, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screening for more than 50 years, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi President and CEO Ashley Coffield said Tuesday.
Withdrawing Title X funds will drive up costs for people who already face barriers to access health care, she said.
“We’re going to hang on as long as we can and provide the care without having the reimbursement,” Coffield said. 
Trump administration targets Planned Parenthood’s family-planning grants

The notice of suspension also went to Mississippi-based organization Converge, Inc., which began receiving Title X funds in 2023 to provide Tennesseans with low- and no-cost reproductive health care. Converge has served nearly 12,000 patients through 33 health centers in Tennessee, according to the organization.
In a letter to Converge, HHS cited Converge’s public statement, “Our Commitment to Addressing Systemic Racism,” as grounds for compliance review based on civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin.
The department is also assessing compliance with executive orders, including President Donald Trump’s “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” order barring publicly funded benefits to people without legal immigration status.
“Every day that there is a delay in Title X funding is a day that patients across Mississippi and Tennessee go without care,” Converge Co-founder Jamie Bardwell stated. “This will create a cascading effect across the South, disrupting access to basic health care services … These disruptions will lead to increased negative health outcomes, including higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs.”
HHS did not share a timeline for its compliance reviews. 
Converge will “comply with the requests outlined by HHS and demonstrate our adherence to this administration’s orders,” Bardwell stated. “People’s lives depend on it.”
Real people’s lives are going to suffer’
Title X funding has been distributed to the two organizations after the Tennessee Department of Health was kicked out of the program for violating the conditions of the grant by refusing to provide patients with “non-directive” counseling that included abortion after the state instituted an abortion ban. The state health department previously received roughly $8 million from the program.
In the 16 months that the organization has received grant funding, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi has served 21,989 patients and logged 22,263 visits in Tennessee, Coffield said. The organization provides care on a sliding fee scale based on family size and income.
Planned Parenthood received $3.8 million last year to provide services in Tennessee, according to Coffield. Converge received just under $8.4 million in fiscal year 2024 to provide services in Mississippi and Tennessee, HHS records show.
The Title X grant funding cycle was slated to end March 31, with renewals beginning April 1. In previous years, organizations would have been told weeks in advance what funding level to expect for the coming year, Coffield said. Instead, they got the letter informing them of the funding freeze — the first correspondence they’ve received under Trump’s second administration.










It seems like the Trump administration and Elon Musk are appeasing their anti-abortion backers and targeting basic health care that has nothing to do with abortion. Real people's lives are going to suffer as a result. 


– Ashley Coffield, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi


CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, a Converge sub-grantee, operates a walk-in clinic in Memphis providing birth control, emergency contraception, confirmation of pregnancy and options counseling and HIV testing, in addition to other testing and treatment services.
“CHOICES is heartbroken to have lost critical Title X funding—funding that provides essential family planning and wellness services that are especially important in places like Tennessee, where we face a total abortion ban and an utter lack of maternal health care services,” President and CEO Jennifer Pepper stated, pledging to fighting for patient care.
Coffield said the freeze is causing unnecessary chaos, confusion and anxiety for patients.
“It seems like the Trump administration and Elon Musk are appeasing their anti-abortion backers and targeting basic health care that has nothing to do with abortion,” she said. “Real people’s lives are going to suffer as a result.”
Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi will work to continue providing affordable care without support from Title X funding in the event of permanent loss.
“We will do everything that we can to continue to help people get the care that they need, that it’s affordable, that they have the freedom to choose to come to the provider of their choice, and that they’re not forced out of getting basic care by the Trump administration and Elon Musk,” Coffield said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A Tennessee Republican leading the effort to exclude some immigrant children from public schools has refused to rule out the possibility his bill could also force educators to report students to U.S. immigration authorities.
Sen. Bo Watson, a Republican from Hixson, is cosponsoring the legislation to require immigration status checks of every student at each one of Tennessee’s more than 1700 K-12 public and charter schools.
School districts would then have the option to deny children without legal status access to an education or charge their families tuition.
The bill’s language contains no requirement that schools report students without legal status to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but Watson told lawmakers Tuesday that was “something to be considered in the rules and regulations” the state Department of Education would develop should the bill become law.
The prospect drew immediate pushback from Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat.
“I think that sets a dangerous precedent for our schools, where folks go to schools to be protected, and now children are going to be subjected to be wrangled up by ICE officials if they can’t provide the appropriate documents,” said Lamar, one of two Democrats on the 11-member Senate Finance committee.

Lawmakers on the committee voted 7-4 to approve the measure, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote “no.” Tuesday’s vote was the bill’s last stop in the Senate before it heads for a full vote on the floor.
The bill has yet to be reconciled with its House counterpart, which gives school districts the option – rather than the mandate – to check student immigration status, exclude children or charge tuition.
A statement by the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition called the bill’s advancement a “troubling step towards exclusionary policies undermining our public education system’s foundational principles of equality and access.”
A test case
If enacted, Tennessee would likely become the only state in the nation to deny students without legal status the right to a public school education.
Texas, Indiana, Idaho and Ohio are weighing similar school exclusion policies, but Tennessee is the only state in which a bill is actively moving through its legislature, according to the National Immigration Law Center.
The bill has drawn large and often loud protests as it winds its way through the legislative process, but Tuesday’s meeting drew a smaller and more muted turnout.
One protester, 80-year-old Lynne McFarland, was carried out of the Capitol by state troopers after she refused to leave voluntarily.
Tennessee GOP bills target public school education for immigrant children without legal status

Republican backers of the bill have said they hope it serves as a test case to overturn Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 Supreme Court case that established that all children have a constitutionally-protected right to a public school education regardless of immigration status.
Watson on Tuesday said that the legislation was necessary to address the rising costs of illegal immigration for Tennessee taxpayers, including a steep increase in state expenditures for English-Language Learner (ELL) instruction since 2016.
“The proposition is that we continue to increase exponentially the funding we are providing for ELL education, and I have long felt we need to have a conversation imposed upon the citizens in funding ELL,” Watson said.
“While ELL incorporates both documented and undocumented students, it is difficult or impossible to tease out the difference between the two, and I use ELL funding as at least a correlation of what may be occurring within the undocumented community,” he said.
Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat, said that in his Nashville district 80% of English language learners are U.S. citizens or legal residents. Yarbro argued the exclusion of children without legal status would do little to reduce ELL costs.










What’s the long term-cost of having a group of people who are, at the state’s direction, illiterate and just creating a long term underclass in society. That tends not to work well.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville 


Tennessee schools would also continue to receive consistent funding even if immigrant children are disenrolled. Gov. Bill Lee’s school voucher bill, enacted earlier this year, guarantees steady funding to schools experiencing enrollment drops.
Instead, Yarbro said, the state may incur greater costs by preventing children from attending school.
“What’s the long term-cost of having a group of people who are, at the state’s direction, illiterate and just creating a long term underclass in society,” he said. “That tends not to work well.”
A fiscal analysis of the bill noted it may also jeopardize over $1 billion in federal education funding to the state for violating federal civil rights law.
‘People, humans, only get to be 6 or 7 once’
Yarbro questioned why Republican lawmakers weren’t focused on enacting legislation that punishes employers who rely on immigrant workers if the aim of the bill is to reduce illegal immigration.
“Instead, we are in this legislation punishing kids. Children. For conduct that, regardless of what you think here, certainly isn’t the 6-year-old or 7-year-old’s fault,” he said. “People, humans, only get to be 6 or 7 once.”
GOP bill allowing Tennessee schools to deny an education to immigrant children advances

Yarbro also questioned the financial cost of requiring school officials to verify immigration documents of every student, noting the complexity of immigration law could prove challenging to local schools.
“If you talk to districts and think about what it means to convert all 1800 public schools into institutions that review the citizenship status of every student every year, that is going to be massively expensive,” he said.
Watson, however, noted that school districts already require parents and guardians to produce documents as a requirement for enrollment.
“I believe they’re already asking for this information and I believe the costs would be insignificant,” he said.
The House version of the bill, sponsored by Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, is scheduled to be heard in the House Government Operations Committee. No date for the House hearing nor a Senate floor vote has yet been set.

Senate Bill 1425 sponsored by Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, was rejected last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee, averting the effort to pass legislation enabling physicians to perform abortions for “fatal fetal anomalies” without the threat of being charged with “criminal abortion.” Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, a Signal Mountain Republican, sponsored the House version of the bill to provide a new exception for abortions after the legislature outlawed the procedure three years ago.
In its place, the lawmakers are supporting Senate Bill 1004, which expands the conditions in which a woman could be at substantial risk for death or irreversible impairment, enabling her to have an abortion. It is set to go to the Senate floor for consideration.
  Rep. Bryan Terry, a Murfreesboro Republican and a physician, is sponsoring a bill that would allow doctors to perform an abortion if medically necessary to save a pregnant woman’s life. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The House Health Committee approved its version Tuesday on a 15-6 vote. Committee Chairman Bryan Terry, who sponsored the bill, assured lawmakers it didn’t provide new exceptions for an abortion but listed conditions doctors could use to determine whether a woman should end a dangerous pregnancy.
Terry, a Murfreesboro anesthesiologist, told colleagues that doctors could use the definitions to make a diagnosis and then decide whether an abortion would be medically necessary to save the mother’s life. All efforts would have to be made to save the baby, in keeping with the state’s abortion law. 
The Tennessee Medical Association supported the “fatal fetal anomalies” bill following an October 2024 ruling in Blackmon v. State of Tennessee in which a three-judge panel found that physicians may terminate pregnancies to save a woman’s life when she’s critically ill. The court also outlined the types of fatal fetal diagnosis that could qualify under the ruling after women who had to leave the state for abortion procedures filed suit.
The bill sponsored by Briggs and Terry, both Republicans, gives a clearer definition of the times a woman could receive an abortion, including “inevitable abortion,” a type of miscarriage in which the pregnancy ends and the uterus expels matter. It also includes any medically diagnosed condition that complicates a pregnancy to the point the woman could die from deadly problems such as ruptured membranes, “inevitable abortion,” severe preeclampsia and an infection that can result in uterine rupture or loss of fertility.
Because the matter remains in litigation, Briggs would say only that the bill headed to the Senate floor “complements” the court ruling.
Tennessee Medical Association lobbyist Julie Baker said her group was disappointed that the initial bill failed but called the replacement measure “a step in the right direction.” She was uncertain whether the group would push the defeated bill again next year, but said “fatal fetal anomalies” remain a problem, forcing women to travel out of state for abortions to avoid the risk of life-threatening pregnancies.

Other topics ran the gamut, from tax cuts and transgender sports to water resources and parental rights.
The voting measure, Senate Bill 10, would no longer allow students at Indiana’s public institutions to use their college IDs as proof of identity at the polls. But the reason seemed unclear — as sponsor Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, continually referred to “concern” that college students aren’t residents.

“I think a lot of the concern here that we’re missing is: a university ID does not prove that that is an Indiana resident,” he said.
But Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, noted there is an entirely different part of law that governs residency and voter registration. The bill doesn’t impact that law.
“We’re singling students out. If your concern is about registration, then deal with that,” he said.
Pierce and others noted that most college IDs meet the four requirements in state law: to have a name, photo, expiration date and to be issued by a state or federal entity.
Rep. Chris Campbell, D-West Lafayette, observed that U.S. passports are allowed as proof of identity at the polls, but don’t have addresses or even a state of residency on them.
“Who are these students voting for overall? I’m just going to be truthful. They are a threat. They are a threat to Republicans in this state,” said Rep. Renee Pack, D-Indianapolis.
But Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, held up his driver’s license and listed things Hoosiers can’t do without it: buy alcohol, some cold medicine, fly on a plane.
“We already have created a system where you need one of these to do everything almost everybody over the age of 18 is doing,” he said. “I don’t think it’s too much to ask if you are going to vote to have one of these.”
Non-drivers can also obtain state identification cards.
The bill passed 67-24 and now returns to the Senate.
 Progress on income tax cuts
Hoosiers could see upcoming cuts to the state individual income tax rate under a different measure approved 74-18 in the House.
Senate Bill 451 would drop the rate by 0.05% beginning in 2030, if state general fund revenue collections exceed 3.5% growth in each of the four preceding fiscal years. The next year’s revenue forecast also must be at least 3.5%.
The reductions would continue in every even-numbered year through 2040.
Current law is phasing Indiana’s flat income tax rate down from 3.05% in 2024 to: 3.0% in 2025, 2.95% in 2026, and 2.9% in 2027 and years thereafter.
Each 0.05 percentage point reduction of tax rate would result in a decline of income tax revenues between $150 million to $200 million annually, according to a fiscal analysis for the legislation.
“It’s a hard bar to cross, but it would occur in those cases where state revenue is really growing,” said Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton.










The human existence is all about opportunity cost. When we forgo billions of dollars, we are making a decision to disinvest in the future.


– Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis


He added that “we gain as a state when we do this” because it attracts business and residents.
Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, said Indiana’s coffers have already lost $6 billion since 2015, when lawmakers started slowly reducing the rate. The bill would mean billions more in revenue gone.
“The human existence is all about opportunity cost. When we forgo billions of dollars, we are making a decision to disinvest in the future,” he said.
Porter noted the state could afford things like a fully funded statewide Pre-K program or subsidies for paid family leave and child care if taxes weren’t continually cut.
The bill was changed in the House, meaning the Senate must accept the changes before it goes to the governor.
 House OKs economic development reforms
Transparency and entrepreneurship additionally highlighted a separate bill also passed in the House, on an 87-4 vote.
Senate Bill 516 establishes an office for entrepreneurship and innovation, an agenda item for Gov. Mike Braun.
But it also holds provisions taking aim at the IEDC, which has faced years worth of backlash from lawmakers and constituents alike over its secretive approach to economic development efforts like the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace (LEAP) District.

The legislation would require the quasi-public agency to tell local units of government and the State Budget Committee about acquisitions of more than 100 acres — whether it’s bought in one or multiple transactions — at least 30 days before those purchases close.
The bill also tasks the IEDC and the executives of communities that host innovation development districts — like one within LEAP — with annually compiling reports about the districts’ activities over the last calendar year.
And it lists what would be included: revenue received, expenses paid, fund balances, debt details, information on parcels within tax increment financing districts and the amounts locals receive in revenue-sharing agreements. The reports would go to the community’s fiscal body and to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
The Senate has to accept changes to the bill or send it for final negotiations.
 Bipartisan support for water-related measures
The House unanimously approved two other bills dealing with water withdrawals.
Senate Bill 4 would require that developers of long-haul water pipelines — over 30 miles long and transporting more than 10 million gallons a day — must go to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and seek certificates of public convenience and necessity.

There are also strict permitting requirements for transferring water from one water basin to another.
“This deals with concerns as we have been building water policy,” said Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “It’s a pretty important bill.”
Senate Bill 28, dealing with “significant” groundwater withdrawals of more than 100,000 gallons of water a day, also passed easily.
Rep. Shane Lindauer, R-Jasper, said the legislation is intended meant to head off disputes when water withdrawals might cause nearby well failures as the state continues to pursue water-intensive industries.
Both bills were changed in the House, so the Senate must accept the changes before they go to the governor.
 Parental rights bill headed back to Senate
A bill spurred by anger at the Indiana Department of Child Services over parental rights passed the House 69-24.
Lindauer said the bill recognizes that “parents have a fundamental God-given right to direct the upbringing of their children.”
Senate Bill 143 specifically requires courts to give deference to parental rights when disputes with government regulations occur.
During the committee hearing, parents from multiple counties told stories of having their children taken away due to alleged abuse but later being exonerated. In some instances, medical records of the children have been kept from parents.
The Senate has to accept changes to the bill or send it for final negotiations.
Senate grapples with amendments
Across the building on Tuesday, Senate Republicans batted away a series of Democratic amendments to a bill limiting transgender female athletic participation. 
Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, authored two identical amendments — one for high school students and another for college enrollees — that would bar officials from examining an athlete’s “bathing suit area … to determine the student athlete’s biological sex.”
“There is no evidence that this has happened in Indiana under the current law in place and I haven’t heard of any requirements in any other state,” said Sen. Stacey Donato. “I ask you to defeat this amendment.”

Donato, R-Logansport, sponsored House Bill 1041, which would bar transgender female athletes from participating on college athletic teams aligning with their gender. The proposal is an expansion of the current ban on K-12 students. 
Republicans also beat back three other amendments to the bill: one establishing a grievance process for college students injured by the bill; one allowing a college to discipline students who make accusations; and another creating a student-athlete “bill of rights.” 
Only Donato, who read her brief rebuttals from a piece of paper, spoke on any of the amendments. All five were defeated on party-line votes. 
Two other bills encountered little opposition: one letting the Indiana Gaming Commission regulate bare-knuckle fighting and another granting students additional excused absences for 4-H or Future Farmers of America activities. 
The latter, House Bill 1660, now heads to the governor’s desk. 
“FFA and 4-H are important organizations that help prepare our youth to be successful adults,” Buchanan said. “As someone who has worked with FFA for many years, I have seen firsthand the great work these youth organizations have done in our communities across the state,” said Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon, in a statement. 
Buchanan sponsored the bill. Both bills moved out of the Senate on a 47-2 vote.

Mallory McMorrow is running to be the state’s next U.S. Senator. After more than two months of speculation and overt hints, McMorrow made it official Wednesday that she wants to replace U.S. Sen.

Photo by Jon KingIt’s probably the worst kept secret in Michigan politics: State Sen. Mallory McMorrow is running to be the state’s next U.S. Senator.
After more than two months of speculation and overt hints, McMorrow made it official Wednesday that she wants to replace U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, who will not seek reelection in 2026.
McMorrow stakes her claim as a new type of Democrat in her campaign video that takes not-so-subtle swipes at the current party leadership, mockingly referencing the “little paddles” Democrats used at President Donald Trump’s congressional address last month and disdaining “the same old crap out of Washington.”
While the outsider brand is nothing new in politics, the Royal Oak Democrat believes her own lived experience will resonate with Michigan voters disillusioned with the status quo.
“I graduated right into the recession. I had a great internship that did not lead to a job. I had tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. I spent a couple of nights sleeping in the backseat of my car. And what I know is that there are so many people who simply do not believe that the American dream is possible for them anymore,” McMorrow told the Michigan Advance.
In 2024, Democrats lost control of the U.S. Senate while Peters chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage this term. Democrats managed to hang onto Stabenow’s seat in 2024, as now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) narrowly defeated former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake). While Democrats hope to retake the upper chamber in 2026, Peters’ decision makes that task considerably harder for the party that will have to defend another open seat.

While McMorrow is the first Democrat to announce for the Senate seat, other potential rivals for the Democratic nomination include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who Politico reported in February had hired additional staff for a possible run. Meanwhile, sources told The Detroit News that newly-elected U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) is also considering a run.
A previous possibility, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, took himself out of the running in March.
On the Republican side, Rogers has hinted at another run in 2026.
McMorrow’s announcement, including a website launch, comes at a time of deep discontent on the part of many Democratic voters, with a recent CNN poll of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents finding the party with a record-low 29% favorability rating. 
However, McMorrow says her call for new leadership in the party is predicated on it being result-oriented.
“I’m not somebody who fights just for the sake of fighting and I think people get really sick of that as well,” McMorrow said. “Replicating what we see on the Republican side does not actually get us out of this mess.”
McMorrow has achieved a certain level of national recognition, largely based on her viral video moment in the Michigan Senate in 2022, when she spoke forcefully against transphobic comments made by state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton Township). McMorrow’s campaign video highlights that speech in which McMorrow turned what had been meant as an attack on her into a critique of Republicans focusing on culture war issues at the expense of providing better roads and lowering healthcare costs. Her response drew praise from national pundits she received in its aftermath.
She also got a primetime speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention last year, lugging an oversize bound copy of Project 2025 and offering a warning of what it portended, which in retrospect seems rather prophetic. 
“If Donald Trump gets back into the White House, he’s going to fire civil servants like intelligence officers, engineers, and even federal prosecutors, if he decides that they don’t serve his personal agenda,” she said to the convention delegates. “They’re talking about replacing the entire federal government with an army of loyalists who answer only to Donald Trump.”

McMorrow’s goal now is to parlay that national reputation into a winning strategy for voters across Michigan, an argument she plans to make based on results she’s helped lead as the state Senate’s majority whip, the first woman to hold that position.
“We can point to things like expanded childcare. That we are on the path to universal pre-K, universal school meals, which I hear all the time from parents, more than the cost savings is the amount of time that it saves them to get ready and get their kids ready and out the door. Repealing the seniors retirement tax. We just have so much that we can show that we’ve done in Michigan and I want to take that into the U.S. Senate,” McMorrow said.
What she would prefer to offer is a vision of the American dream that cuts across ideological lines, which her ability to provide has been compared to another Midwestern state senator whose oratorical skills took him from the Illinois statehouse to the U.S. Senate, and ultimately the White House. 
And while McMorrow doesn’t claim to be the next Barack Obama, she does aspire to emulate his power of persuasion.
“Everytime I heard Barack Obama speak, I was inspired and I was inspired to do more. One thing he did, and does exceptionally well, is not let the listener be passive. There is an acknowledgment that we all have to work together.,” McMorrow said, adding that when Obama endorsed her state Senate candidacy in 2018, it was one of the most deeply moving days of her life.
“If I can make anybody feel the way that he made me feel, then we’re going to be better off,” she said.
McMorrow’s timing also comes just a week after releasing a book, “Hate Won’t Win: Find Your Power and Leave This Place Better Than We Found It,” a part memoir, part “how to” manual for affecting change at the local level, something she says voters are hungering for.
“I’ve got people coming out to my town halls and coffee hours and responding on my Instagram every week asking not what am I going to do to fight back but what they can do,” she said. “We need leadership who is going to bring them onto the team. I can’t fix the entire Democratic Party, but we can show through this campaign a very different way to run a campaign and hopefully change things moving forward.”
With her hat now in the ring, McMorrow has a marathon and a sprint ahead of her. The marathon is the race she’ll run between now and the Democratic primary in August 2026, with the sprint to the general election just three months later in November. Of course, that’s only if she wins the primary, something McMorrow says she isn’t taking for granted. Nor does she intend to make one pitch for the primary and another for the general.
“My message of a new American dream and opportunity, that’s going to be the same message I would have in a general election,” McMorrow said. “It is not in my nature to run one way in a primary and then turn around and run a different way in a general, because people will see right through that, and they should.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Legislature’s budget-setting committee appears likely to reverse a preliminary cut in state aid to the University of Nebraska recommended by Gov. Jim Pillen.
The nine-member Appropriations Committee decided Tuesday, the second day of considering whether to reverse the cut and instead increase NU’s state appropriation, to table the vote on the change for at least one more day until there was more “clarity.” That means a vote could come Wednesday on the university system’s annual “I Love NU Day” celebration at the Capitol.

Multiple committee members said NU President Jeffrey Gold and Pillen continue to discuss a path forward after the committee’s preliminary budget kept Pillen’s 2% cut in year-over-year appropriations, equating to a $14.3 million reduction in each of the next two fiscal years.
State Sens. Myron Dorn of Adams, Rob Dover of Norfolk and Paul Strommen of Sidney said their understanding is that Pillen and NU have settled at a 1.25% increase instead.
“I think we all agreed on the 1.25,” Dorn told the Nebraska Examiner.
Part of the change came after the three senators and committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood met with Pillen and continued talking with university officials.
‘Clarification’ needed before vote
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said NU needs at least a 2.5% increase each year, partly because of greater uncertainty in federal funding under President Donald Trump.
Dorn initially proposed a 1.25% increase for the next fiscal year, but Spivey questioned whether the deal that Pillen and Dr. Gold reached was for a 1.25% increase in each fiscal year. Such a deal would return the $14.3 million each year to NU with an additional $8.7 million in the first year, according to the legislative fiscal office.
If the second year were included, it would add $17.6 million to NU’s state-supported bottom line.

Gold, in a Tuesday evening call with the Examiner, said his understanding is for a 1.25% increase in each of the next two budget years. He said that would be “a world of a difference” from the 2% cut. This is Gold’s 12th year at NU but his first budget cycle as president.
Dorn, now in his seventh year on the committee, said NU never saw a decrease in his six years that NU faced a decrease because of the state’s projected $457 million budget deficit.
Pillen and NU disagreed over the university budget two years ago, when the governor, a university regent for almost 10 years and a University of Nebraska-Lincoln alum, proposed giving NU a 2% annual increase. NU at the time sought a 3% annual increase.
The committee and lawmakers ultimately landed at a 2.5% annual increase. 
This time around, the NU Board of Regents in August requested a 3.5% increase in state aid each fiscal year, which Gold said was largely to cover inflationary costs and some increased health care costs.
‘Budgetary holes’
Gold described this budget cycle as “normal.” The “wrench” that has come into conversation, he said, is “existential forces that are in play on the federal side of the equation.” He said NU hasn’t wavered from its mission to foster a future workforce and support agriculture and the medical and business communities.
Tuition and state dollars are the predominant legs of NU’s budget in a “delicate balance,” Gold said. But each state dollar invested, he added, is $1 less needed in tuition increases.
“In the interest of keeping higher education accessible and affordable, the changes that they’re proposing will be helpful,” Gold said.

Asked how the changes could impact students, Gold added: “The bigger the budget gap, the more seriously we have to consider tuition changes.”
Gold said the NU Board of Regents “had no clue” in August how much the future federal situation would impact NU. He said the evolving federal situation leads to rapid budget changes “both plus and minus every day” as cuts are implemented but later rolled back, frozen or put on hold via court order.
By the end of the day Monday, in preparation for committee deliberations on Tuesday, Gold said NU had tracked losing $34.4 million in federal grants, while another $1.9 million in grants had been put on pause. If a currently blocked federal plan to cap indirect costs paid to research universities and medical schools at 15% proceeds, NU would lose $27 million.
NU also receives $700 million in other grants or contracts, or about $58 million monthly. Some have been delayed, and some may catch up, Gold said. Still, holes are left in the meantime.
“I am very optimistic that that is going to be restored, because the importance of this research is critical to the economy of our country and quality of life of Americans,” Gold said. “But until it’s restored, it’s creating budgetary holes that we’re gonna have to dig out of.”
Of federal funding, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, an Appropriations Committee member, said: “We’ve got our heads in the sand, and we’re ignoring the massive cuts that President Gold is telling us the university has already been receiving.”
Clements said the federal cuts were why the committee reconsidered the state budget cut to NU at all.
Return on investment
NU’s cut was included in the committee’s preliminary budget in February, helping minimize the two-year projected budget shortfall down to $289 million. 
Restoring or expanding NU’s annual appropriations could grow the state deficit.
Cavanaugh said the committee has the funds and that the deficit doesn’t actually exist. She said the committee could use some of the $780 million in state funding set aside for tax credits to offset property taxes that local governments levy. Cavanaugh said the state could fund public schools directly or eliminate unfunded mandates to lower property taxes.

She said colleagues were making a choice to be in a deficit while the university needs appropriate resources to continue offering a world-class education at a reasonable cost.
“The priorities of the majority of the Nebraska legislative body are completely out of whack with what the responsibility is of government to provide a public good,” she told the Examiner.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha said she continued to think NU should get a decrease in its general state appropriations because NU is getting $300 million for a health-centered project in Omaha. That appropriation would come over six fiscal years and is paired with private philanthropic dollars and would keep NU competitive in the medical and health fields.
Spivey said that commitment is separate and that the dollars aren’t flexible. She noted the state needs to invest in NU, which a recent economic impact study found annually adds $10 to the economy for every dollar spent on NU. Gold said the return on investment for every research dollar is greater, up to $16 returned.
University ‘going nowhere’
While he supported an increase to NU, Dorn noted that the state budget is a give-and-take for the budget and that if NU went up, something else might need to be cut.
  State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Gold said that in the face of the rising costs, NU remains a sure investment.
“The University of Nebraska is going nowhere, and our ability to return positively to the economy of the State of Nebraska is not going to change. It’s only going to grow over time,” Gold said. “To the extent that we cut the budget, that is just going to give the Appropriations Committee less funds to appropriate next year.”
The NU community will be out “in force” Wednesday for the annual celebration, Gold said, as he looks ahead to a day of gratitude. He said that next week regents will consider the “penultimate version” of a new strategic plan as part of the beginning of Gold’s presidency.
Gold has framed NU’s next era as an “odyssey to extraordinary.”
“I learned a long time ago: What’s good for the State of Nebraska is good for the university,” Gold said Tuesday. “We are very, very focused on building the future for the state.”

Attorney Stephanie Taub (right) of the First Liberty Institute also supported the bill. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas House committee approved a bill Tuesday that supporters said would protect religious freedom, a day after the Senate rejected a bill with a similar stated goal.
House Bill 1615 will be heard by the full House Wednesday after passing the Judiciary Committee on a split voice vote following nearly an hour of public opposition. The bill would “prohibit the government from discriminating against certain individuals and organizations because of their beliefs regarding marriage or what it means to be female or male.”
This would protect Arkansas government employees from adverse employment action if they refuse to do something within the context of their jobs that conflicts with their “sincerely held religious beliefs,” such as providing a marriage license to a same-sex couple, according to the bill.
House Bill 1669, which had similar language regarding the “sincerely held religious beliefs” of parents seeking to foster or adopt children in Arkansas, failed in the Senate Monday after passing a House committee, the full House and the Senate Judiciary Committee in March. The bill’s Republican sponsors, Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Alan Clark of Lonsdale, said HB 1669 would ensure Arkansas does not join the ranks of states in which parents who do not accept or affirm LGBTQ+ children’s identities are not allowed to foster or adopt.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said the bill would set a “dangerous precedent” by shielding foster or adoptive parents from adverse government action if their faith-based actions harm children. He reminded the chamber that not all “sincerely held religious beliefs” are Christian.

Fifteen Republican senators voted for the bill, which needed 18 votes to pass. Dismang and three other Republicans joined the chamber’s six Democrats in voting against the bill. Five more Republicans did not vote and four voted present. The Senate later expunged the vote, and the bill is on the upper chamber’s Wednesday agenda.
The original version of Act 733 of 2023 included language about foster care, adoption agencies and the issuing of marriage licenses similar to both HB 1669 and HB 1615. That legislation was amended to remove such specific language. Critics said it would not only empower anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination but also would contradict a similarly worded ballot measure that voters rejected in 2022.
Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, is the primary sponsor of Act 733 and HB 1615. Attorneys from the conservative First Liberty Institute and the Family Council’s Arkansas Justice Institute supported Lundstrum in presenting the bill to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
 Tuesday’s debate

Attorney J.P. Tribell was the only opponent of Bentley’s bill in the March 12 House committee hearing, but one of eight opponents of HB 1615 Tuesday.

“[There are] some rural counties where possibly everybody in the courthouse might be opposed to gay marriage, and if somebody wants to get a marriage license and they can find nobody, at what point do we determine that there’s an undue burden on the person seeking a marriage license?” Tribell said. “Do they have to drive two to three hours to get to Little Rock to do that?”
Civics educator Gail Choate said HB 1615 espouses the “opposite logic” of Act 116 of 2025, which all but one of HB 1615’s 13 sponsors supported. Act 116 prohibits public entities from engaging in identity-based “discriminination” or “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
“This bill does not evaluate individuals based on their actions, their qualifications or their ability to contribute to society,” Choate said. “It singles them out solely based upon their identity.”
Other opponents of the bill spoke on behalf of themselves or their loved ones in the LGBTQ+ community. Kaymo O’Connell, a transgender high school senior from Little Rock, expressed concern about experiencing employment discrimination upon entering the workforce in the near future.
HB 1615 allows government employees who issue marriage licenses to recuse themselves from doing so. Marie Mainard O’Connell, Kaymo’s mother, said HB 1615 lacks a public notification process for such recusals.

“That’s where the harm occurs,” she said. “[People] are harmed when they expect to be cared for, and then they are told, ‘I don’t believe that about you, I don’t have to care for you that way.’ That creates a moment of trauma.”
Social workers Kirsten Sowell and Courtney Frierson said HB 1615 would create a conflict between their ethical codes, which include acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, and the fact that the state issues their professional licenses.
“If my licensing board receives a complaint based on someone’s religious disagreement with my inclusive care, who are they supposed to protect: me or the complainant?” Frierson said. “That’s a legal gray zone, and it’s not theoretical, it’s coming.”
No members of the public or of the House Judiciary Committee spoke in favor of HB 1615. Opposition on the committee primarily came from its Democrats, including Rep. Nicole Clowney of Fayetteville, who called it “blatant viewpoint discrimination.”
“We heard a lot of abstract ideas about religious freedom [today],” she said. “We did not hear from one person who is for this bill who is currently being persecuted.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner. Leaders of the Universities of Wisconsin and the state Department of Corrections (DOC) defended Gov. Tony Evers’ budget requests to lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee during a meeting Tuesday. 
The hearing marks the start of lawmakers’ official work on the state budget, which will continue this week with public hearings in Kaukauna on Wednesday and West Allis on Friday. 
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (Beaver Dam), co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee, said during a press conference ahead of the meeting that they were looking for “justification” on the “massive” requests from the UW and wanted an explanation of the plan for DOC. 
“[The DOC request is] lacking in a lot of details and seems to be a little short of being able to accomplish its mission, but I’m interested to hear more about how they arrived at that and why they made some of the decisions they made and hopefully provide some information that will allow us to improve that plan and make sure that it’s a good plan for the future of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and for public safety here in Wisconsin,” Born said. 
In the past, lawmakers have heard from a greater number of agencies about their requests. During the last budget cycle, lawmakers heard from four agencies, including DOC, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Safety and Professional Services and the Department of Administration. That year, state Superintendent Jill Underly traveled to Eau Claire to talk to lawmakers about the Department of Public Instruction budget after not getting an invitation to speak. 
The lawmakers said it would have been a “waste of their time and our time” to hold briefings with other agencies.
“[The agency leaders] just have not been straight with us on things. They just don’t want to really talk about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” Born said. He said lawmakers were hopeful that the UW and DOC would work with them to answer some questions. 
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman told lawmakers during the briefing that he agrees with Gov Tony Evers’ assessment that this will be a “make it or break it” budget for the UW system. Evers’ request for the UW includes an additional $856 million, which would be one of the largest investments in the university campuses in state history. 
Rothman acknowledged that the request is “significant” but he emphasized that Wisconsin currently sits at 43rd out of 50 when it comes to state investment in public universities. The investments in the request would bring the system up to the median nationwide. 
Rothman explained to lawmakers that inflation and a lack of state investment over the last three decades to meet increasing costs has hindered the UW system. 
UW schools have worked to make changes, he said. When he started as president in June 2022, Rothman said 10 of the system’s 13 campuses were running fiscal deficits. That number is now six and should hit zero over the next year or so. He also noted there have been six two-year colleges that have closed or will close this year.
Rothman called the reforms necessary and said that the changes position the system for sound investments from the state. 
“We have to be asking ourselves a question: who will teach our children and grandchildren? Where will the nurses come from that will help care for our families and perhaps ourselves? Where will the engineers come from?” Rothman told lawmakers.
Rothman explained that the proposals seek to address five goals including increasing affordability, accessibility, developing talent, ensuring quality and investing in innovation.
“You cannot cut your way to success,” Rothman said. “You need to invest.” 
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) asked Rothman what would happen if the state did not fund the requests. 
“If we get the budget funded, we will not have to raise tuition. If we don’t get funded at an adequate level, that’s one of the levers… that I don’t want to have to use,” Rothman said. “I want to be able to maintain the accessibility that our students get, but we will do what we need to do, and it won’t be just one piece. That will be multiple levers, and we get more efficient in some places. We have to stop offerings, programs at certain universities.”
Republican lawmakers grilled Rothman on “administrative bloat” across the system and requests for additional positions and funding from the UW schools. 
The budget request would add 214 positions funded by state general purpose revenue to UW campuses. Rothman noted that UW campuses, excluding flagship UW-Madison, have lost 6,000 positions funded by the state since 2019. 
Born asked why there was a request for 13 additional staff members to support students who have aged out of the foster care system. He noted that a 2023-24 report found there were 420 of those students across the system. 
“I’m trying to wrap my head around — you talked about strategic investments, sound investments, and you’re asking for 13 positions, one on every campus to serve 420 kids?” Born asked. 
Rothman said the intention would be to expand the number of students who could be supported. 
“They’ve had a tough lot in life to start with,”  Rothman said, adding that the additional staffing  could give those students a leg up. “I would hope that we could expand that number.” 
Rothman also said that the specific request is part of the general goal of investing in students to ensure they make it to graduation. 
“If you look at the positions that we have asked for, they are all student-facing. We are trying to help our students be successful,” Rothman said. 
“This is a shining example of the governor’s desire to grow government and your desire to grow your system, and it’s not focused on the reality of how you invest in this stuff,” Born said. 
Born also focused on the idea of funding new programs on UW campuses. 
“Why would we need to fund a curriculum of the future? Isn’t there things that are fading away, things that are no longer of interest to students, things are no longer of interest to the workforce? Shouldn’t there be funds available to offer new things?” Born asked. 
Rothman said that the UW system has cut about 100 programs already. 
“So you’ve eliminated about 100 programs, but you can’t fund a new program and curriculum and AI without more funding?” Born continued. 
“I think the fact of the matter is if we had kept up with inflation in terms of our state support, we’d be in a different position,” Rothman answered. 
Corrections budget 
DOC Sec-designee Jared Hoy also defended Evers’ proposals during the hearing, saying that policy changes, increased investments and capital projects are needed to improve safety in facilities across the state. The proposal, Hoy said, is “not simply a list of funding requests” but is a “blueprint for the future” of state corrections. 
Under the proposal, the state would invest about $634 million in the DOC. The majority of the money would be used to fund major reforms throughout the state’s prisons including infrastructure upgrades and capital improvements to Waupun Correctional Institution, Lincoln Hills School, Stanley Correctional Institution, Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center and John C. Burke Correctional Center. The improvements would culminate in the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
Hoy told lawmakers that the budget proposal was developed through conversations with DOC staff, legislators and outside experts with a focus on “safety for those in our communities and the people that work in our facilities every day.” 
The proposal also includes some policy changes meant to help limit recidivism, including by expanding access to workforce training and substance use treatment for people who have 48 months or less left in their sentences for nonviolent offenses.
“A system that prioritizes re-entry and release, but fails to reduce recidivism is not truly safe. A facility that contains individuals but is dangerous and unstable inside its walls is not safe,” Hoy said. “Safety must be both measured by what happens inside the walls of our facilities, and by what happens when a person releases into the community.”
Hoy said that he hoped lawmakers would see some of their thoughts and ideas for the agency reflected in the plan.
“The governor’s budget request is an opportunity for our state to come together and use our taxpayers’ money responsibly to help keep our children and our communities safe,” Hoy said.
The idea that some lawmakers have floated of building a new facility would take significantly more time and money, he added. 
“Our agency does not have time to wait 10 to 12 years for a new facility to be built,” Hoy said.

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Young Republicans filed a resolution urging lawmakers to study child exploitation by public officials in wake of former Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
A federal judge last week sentenced Holmberg to 10 years behind bars after the former senator pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have commercial sex with minors. Holmberg was a state lawmaker for over four decades, and held the powerful position of Senate Appropriations Committee chair.
House Concurrent Resolution 3037, sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, asks the statehouse to look for ways to prevent future crimes against children by government officials.
Brandon Prichard, chairman of the North Dakota Young Republicans, said the organization decided to propose the resolution after reading a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Defense attorney Mark Friese denied many of the allegations in the memo and said there’s no evidence Holmberg had sex with minors.

Prichard said the Young Republicans were appalled by what they read and thought it necessary to take action this session to set the stage for legislative reform down the line.
“We can’t fix the world overnight,” said Prichard, a former Bismarck lawmaker.
The resolution was passed by the House Delayed Bills Committee last week. It’s scheduled for a hearing before the House Political Subdivisions Committee on Thursday at 9 a.m.
It calls on Legislative Management to research a host of policy changes.
The proposal suggests that lawmakers explore mandatory reporting requirements for public officials, for one. It also asks that legislators study creating a body within the Attorney General’s Office specifically for investigating allegations of child exploitation by public officials.
The proposal recommends looking at instituting stronger penalties for public officials who “engage in, enable or conceal” crimes against children, as well. This could include creating new mandatory minimum sentences, removal from office, loss of retirement benefits and disqualification from holding public office in the future, it states.
The resolution says that the study ought to include a review of what other states have done to address these issues.
The study should also examine ways to protect victims, witnesses and whistleblowers who report child exploitation, the proposed resolution states. At the end of the interim session, lawmakers would put together a report including any recommendations and legislative proposals for the 2027 legislative session.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.











Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families



Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)We have just 11 days left of the legislative session, and 26 bills have made it to the governor’s desk.
The success of the Legislature isn’t based on how many bills it passes — it’s if those bills are helping West Virginians.
Let’s start with the good bills.
Senate Bill 283 would require students to take a personal finance class in order to graduate high school. I’m not a fan of the Legislature dictating what schools should be teaching — they don’t even know their own governing body’s rules — but this is an important life skill. 
Not everyone’s family will teach them how to budget or how to file taxes, or even how to write a check. Some of us are “blessed” with anxiety (I’m talking about me), and are cautious with our spending. Some people are more laissez faire and might spend, spend, spend and not worry about savings or paying bills when they first start out on their own. Honestly, it’s surprising that schools haven’t already been teaching some sort of personal finance — it’s not all just common sense.
Senate Bill 8 also does some good. It provides additional sites and devices for newborn safe surrender. These are sites where someone can drop off a baby without any legal repercussions for abandonment. 
It would also be good if the Legislature passed a few bills that offered more support to people with kids. They could help make child care more affordable and widely available, and ensure parents have paid parental leave.
There are already almost 5,900 children in foster care, and I don’t see the Legislature doing anything to try to get those numbers down. Which brings us to the bills that harm, not help West Virginians. Those include bills that make voting more difficult and eliminate ranked-choice voting (which already wasn’t a thing in West Virginia).
And we can’t forget the transphobic legislation — Senate Bill 456, which is described as a bill to define “men” and “women,” but really is just putting a target on transgender people’s backs.
The House is also considering another anti-LGTBQ+ bill that could soon be on its way to the governor. The Senate has already passed Senate Bill 579, which would cancel out local municipalities Fairness Acts. 
That’s right, the party of “small government” is pushing for a bill that would prohibit city councils and county commissions from establishing their own nondiscrimination ordinances because the state won’t pass its own. 
One West Virginia Republican thinks that racism isn’t a problem anymore.
“I don’t know where this came from, this idea that we are a racist country, that we don’t give equality to women or to different religions or whatever the case may be,” said Sen. Scott Fuller, R-Wayne, in support of banning diversity, equity and inclusion in state government. “Does [racism] exist? I’m sure it does. This is not a perfect world, we don’t live in a perfect society, but to the point that it’s a problem? I really don’t believe it.”
The Republican Party is keeping discrimination alive and strong in West Virginia by passing these bills that target LGBTQ+ people, refusing to pass the Crown Act and eliminating DEI initiatives. 
Democrats in both the House and Senate have introduced bills for the Crown Act. Why are Republicans so scared to make discrimination based on hairstyle and texture illegal?
How can anyone say that diversity, equity and inclusion are bad things? What’s so terrible about inclusion? Senate President Randy Smith is the sole sponsor on the bill for Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order. Governor, please tell West Virginians what it is specifically you don’t like about diversity. 
DEI programs have benefitted white women as well as LGTBQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities. I often hear people say they think that DEI leads to less qualified people getting a job over the most qualified white male candidate, and that’s just not the case. 
In other words, those programs have helped West Virginians. That’s the West Virginia I want to live in — where we help each other and not hate each other.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)It’s been three months since members of the 119th Congress were sworn in on Capitol Hill, and the U.S. Senate, especially, has been busy in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second administration.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

A total of 41 Trump appointees have now been confirmed by the Republican-controlled upper chamber, including 21 out of 22 Cabinet-level positions. The Senate also passed a controversial short-term spending bill to fund the federal government through September, enacted new detention requirements for undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes and repealed a handful of Biden-era rules and regulations.
With Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, Democrats don’t have the votes to stop most of Trump’s agenda. But liberal and progressive activists have pressured Democratic senators, including U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, to do more to erect procedural hurdles, slow down Senate business and vote in blanket opposition to Trump nominees as a protest against the executive branch’s unprecedented power grab. The administration’s actions have included mass firings of federal workers, purges of prosecutors involved in criminal proceedings against Trump, and attempted funding freezes and agency shutdowns that run contrary longstanding separation-of-powers principles.
When it comes to Senate floor votes, neither Hickenlooper nor Bennet has heeded the activists’ calls. They have been among the Senate Democrats most likely to back Trump’s Cabinet picks, voting to confirm eight and 10 nominees, respectively, out of the 21 selected so far.

A more comprehensive database tracking 2025 Senate votes, including votes on lower-level appointees, procedural motions and legislation, tells a similar story. The tracker, maintained by Massachusetts-based progressive organizer Jonathan Cohn, tallied 155 votes by the full Senate through March 27.
When collated with 2024 election results, this vote data shows a clear, unsurprising pattern: Senate Democrats representing swing states are more likely than those in safe blue seats to cross the aisle and back Trump’s nominees and legislative priorities. For example, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona — elected narrowly in a state that Trump won by more than 5 percentage points last year — has voted with Republicans on almost 33% in 2025, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren of deep-blue Massachusetts has done so just 3% of the time.
The single biggest exception to this rule? Colorado and its moderate Senate duo, who have voted with Trump and their GOP colleagues roughly a quarter of the time while representing a state that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by 11 percentage points in the 2024 election.

Through the end of March, Hickenlooper — who is serving his first six-year term and up for reelection in 2026 — has been the Democratic caucus’ number one outlier, voting with Trump’s agenda almost twice as often as would be expected, based on the state’s electorate. Bennet ranks sixth out of 47 Senate Democrats by the same metric.
In comparative terms, the Centennial State finds itself in 2025 with the electorate of true-blue Illinois, but the Senate representation of purplish-red Arizona. No other state with two Democratic senators has such a large disconnect between its partisan vote share and its Senate representation. No other state besides New Hampshire even comes close.
As Democrats and independents across Colorado have begun mobilizing in recent months to oppose Trump’s agenda, their disconnect with Hickenlooper and Bennet has been on full display on social media, at town halls and demonstrations and in a daily deluge of calls and messages to the senators’ offices.
Bennet has defended his votes to confirm some Trump appointees — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright — on the grounds that maintaining good relationships with leaders of important executive-branch agencies will help his constituents more than a stance of blanket opposition. He’s also argued that Democrats, after being “repudiated” in the 2024 election, have to “select our battles.”
 A rapid political evolution

If such messages no longer resonate the way they once did with Colorado’s Democratic base, it’s largely because of the state’s rapid political evolution in recent years.
Both of Colorado’s senators entered state politics more than 20 years ago — Hickenlooper as a successful restaurateur elected mayor of Denver in 2003, and Bennet, a friend and fellow Wesleyan University graduate, as his chief of staff. At the time, Colorado was a traditional battleground that had veered to the right: Attorney General Ken Salazar was the only statewide Democratic elected official in a state otherwise dominated by Republicans.
As recently as 2016 — when Hickenlooper and Bennet were in their second terms as Colorado governor and U.S. senator, respectively — Colorado had tilted towards Democrats but could still lay claim to bellwether status, with Republicans like former U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner able to win narrowly in favorable conditions for the GOP. But Trump’s rise abruptly ended that: In the last eight years, Democrats have gone 15 for 15 in statewide elections, winning their races by an average of more than 10 percentage points.
Much of that shift has been driven by voters in fast-growing cities and suburbs along the Front Range. Younger, left-leaning voters have moved to the state in droves. In 2024, even as Democrats lost ground in many states across the country, the party fared relatively well in Colorado, maintaining wide leads among suburban voters and even making gains in more rural areas on the Western Slope.
Political alignments like this don’t last forever. But in an era of nationally polarized politics, Trump has tanked the GOP’s electoral fortunes in Colorado, and for now, a wide gap — partly generational, partly ideological, but perhaps above all attitudinal — has opened up between the state’s two senators and many of its voters.
“Everyone out here, everyone I know — moderates, hardcore left people — they want someone who will fight,” Greeley resident Robert Casey told Bennet at a recent town hall. “And we need that.”

Andy Beshear appeared before a joint session of the House and Senate on Jan. 8, 2025 to deliver his State of the Commonwealth address.  (Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)This article mentions suicide. The number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988.
Changes the Kentucky General Assembly ordered in Medicaid face an uncertain future after Gov. Andy Beshear said lawmakers failed to fund the legislation.
For the second year in a row, Beshear last week sent the House and Senate a letter listing bills that they had passed without providing what Beshear said was the necessary funding. 
Beshear sent the letter on the next to last day of the 2025 session, listing 11 bills and writing “there is still time in this legislative session to add appropriations.”
  Senate President Robert Stivers (LRC Public Information)
The Republican-controlled legislature took no action in response to the Democratic governor’s letter, and Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, told reporters Beshear is obligated to carry out laws as enacted by the legislature.
“He wants to make some excuse about, ‘oh, you didn’t give me the money.’ But it’s basically: ‘yes, you do have the money. Find it within your budgets,’” Stivers said.
Among the 11 bills that Beshear said lack “the appropriations necessary to implement” them  is House Bill 695, which directs the Beshear administration to take steps to enact a Medicaid work requirement while prohibiting the administration from making any changes in the $15 billion program without first receiving the legislature’s approval. The bill also creates a Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board to look for cost savings in Medicaid.
Beshear vetoed the bill and the legislature easily overrode his veto.
The clash comes as Democrats in Washington are bracing to fight Republican efforts in Congress to cut Medicaid — a federal-state program that covers health care for low-income people — in order to pay for renewing federal tax cuts.
In the letter, Beshear said HB 695 would require rebidding Medicaid managed care contracts, which he said would cost the state $1.4 million, including hiring a contractor to help develop the request for proposal. The bill also is estimated to cost $500,000 in state funds to conduct a managed care long-term service study, Beshear wrote.
In his veto of HB 695, Beshear said the Medicaid community engagement requirement, commonly called a work requirement, would “undoubtedly” cost some adults their health coverage and also spark costly litigation challenging the requirement.
  Emily Beauregard
Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, said health care advocates are concerned about new costs associated with a work requirement. “One of our concerns all along with HB 695 has been the additional administrative cost it requires to ultimately provide less health care, which isn’t a good use of taxpayer dollars,” she said. 
Beshear’s letter to lawmakers last week echoed one he sent the year before, which has sparked a lingering controversy over the state’s failure to fund relief for kinship care families. 
Lawmakers have previously said Beshear has misinterpreted a 2005 state Supreme Court decision that he says precludes the executive branch from spending money the legislature has not appropriated. That decision came out of a cycle when the General Assembly passed no budget. 
Still, Beshear wrote: “These holdings are simple: if the legislature creates a  policy or program  but does  not  provide  funding,  it  does  not  intend  for  the  executive  branch  to  perform those services over the biennium. The omission  of  an  appropriation  is  the same  as  its elimination.” 
Beshear also cited a more recent federal court decision.
 
On Friday, Stivers criticized Beshear’s handling of the kinship care issue, which resulted in months of back and forth with no solution for families who are raising minor relatives and need more assistance. 
“He decided to expand Medicaid rolls, not do kinship care, but then he says he doesn’t have the money to do it,” Stivers said. “He picks and chooses what he wants to do, even though we’ve told him what to do.” 
“We’ve talked about on this floor all the things he decided to fund without authority, things he does without authority. We send him bills, and it’s his obligation to carry out those laws that we change and empower him to execute on,” Stivers said. 
Most of the funding for Medicaid comes from the federal government. Beshear said 1.6 million Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Beshear’s letter to lawmakers also said they had failed to take into account the costs of their decision to protect conversion therapy. House Bill 495 overrules restrictions Beshear had placed on the discredited practice and also prohibits Medicaid from covering transgender-affirming medical care. Beshear estimated it would cost $540,000 to $1.95 million in state funds.
‘Flabbergasted:’ Help for kinship care families passed unanimously. $20M price tag could derail it.

“Other states with similar laws have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, some by as much as 72%,” Beshear wrote. “The increase in services expected include an additional six hours of behavioral health counseling and therapy, an increase in pharmacy costs and increased psychiatric hospitalization.” 
Among other bills Beshear said the legislature failed to fund:

Senate Bill 4, which he said would cost at least an estimated $2.5 million to operate a centralized registry of artificial intelligence systems in state government and implement an AI governance process.
House Bill 390 to set up an accessible online vehicle insurance verification system, which Beshear said would cost $600,000 to $1.1 million initially and then $750,000 a year to operate.

Beshear also said that House Bill 346, exempting emergency temporary internal combustion engines from paying an emissions assessment fee and to retroactively refund some fees would cost the Division of Air Quality $1 million in expected revenue from fees.

S. but that's not what's being rolled out. (Getty Images)Fruit of the Loom apparel plants once dotted the Kentucky landscape, with 11,000 workers at factories in Jamestown, Frankfort, Campbellsville, Franklin, Greensburg, Princeton and Bowling Green. In 1987, the company was the state’s second-biggest manufacturer. But over time, Fruit of the Loom began closing plants and moving production to lower-wage countries like Honduras, Haiti and Vietnam. By 2014, all production in the state was gone.
 These plant closings were devastating for laid-off workers and their communities. And they were the result of a bipartisan consensus around trade that prioritized the bottom line of powerful corporate interests above all else. President Donald Trump has long recognized the public anger from such trade policies and is now using it to impose high and blanket tariffs on imports.
While selective tariffs can make sense as part of an industrial policy targeting strategic sectors, the chaotic, broad-based policies the president has rolled out threaten to weaken the economy, raise prices for consumers and harm Kentucky industries without helping address the nation’s enormous trade deficit.
The era of a growing U.S. trade imbalance began in the 1970s with deregulation of the international flow of capital. The trend grew with passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 and greatly accelerated when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Between 2000 and 2010, Kentucky lost a net 100,000 manufacturing jobs in total, one-third of what we had 10 years earlier. The state lost an estimated 45,400 net jobs directly from the China shock and at least 12,100 from NAFTA. Especially hard-hit was employment in computer and electronic parts, metal products and machinery, apparel, furniture and textiles.
Politicians and many economists claimed these changes would be good for all of us. But while consumers got cheaper goods from Wal-Mart, towns were hollowed out, families went bankrupt and deaths of despair rose from drugs, alcohol and suicide. Proponents said the government could always compensate those who lost jobs with financial assistance and retraining. But the money never came, and the training was often a dead end.
Meanwhile the big winners from the shift of jobs overseas were Wall Street, which attracted foreign financial investment from the overvalued U. S. dollar; manufacturing companies that made higher profits off cheaper labor in other countries; and corporations that weakened American unions by using the threat of closure to frighten organizing efforts and win concessions.
There are smart ways to change course and use industrial policy — including selective tariffs — to address the yawning trade deficit and make things better for domestic and foreign workers. Policies could help support strategic industries like autos, steel, energy and semiconductors through public investment, research and development, and union-partnered workforce training in addition to targeted tariffs.
That can help bring back more manufacturing to the U. S., needed not just for jobs but because of its proven linkage to innovation and to build more resilient supply chains that were so clearly lacking in the pandemic. At the same time, we can engage in mutually beneficial trade while better conditioning access to U. S. markets on protection of labor rights and the environment in other countries, helping improve what are often horrifically exploitative working conditions.
But that’s not what is being rolled out. The on-again, off-again and blanket nature of the new tariff policy is creating economic uncertainty that is slowing consumer spending and business investment. The us-against-the-world nature of the tariffs and the bullying trade war stance are already hurting U. S. exports that are facing retaliatory tariffs in industries like Kentucky bourbon. High, comprehensive tariffs can also further increase the value of the dollar and make Kentucky-made products that contain foreign inputs more expensive, hurting U. S. manufacturers and farmers further.
And the cost of tariffs is likely to be passed down to consumers at a time when many are rightly concerned about inflation and the unaffordable prices of basic household goods. At the same time, the administration’s domestic policies are weakening workers’ bargaining power through attacks on unions and undermining the public investments needed in an effective jobs policy by gutting vital federal agencies.
Failed trade policies have created the political room for what the president is now doing. It will take recognizing the ways this policy is the wrong answer to the right question to discover what Kentuckians truly need.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/steel-workers-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Denise Robinson’s role at the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) has changed dramatically since she started 36 years ago. New technology and updated government regulations require constant expansion of her job as a record keeper on state construction projects. 
But her job classification, “engineering technician IV,” has never been upgraded to reflect her growing workload — a problem faced by many of her coworkers and fellow members of the RI IFPTE Local 400, she said.
“They constantly create new things for us to learn; just expect us to adjust with no compensation,” said Robinson, president of the union representing about 300 engineers at RIDOT and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. “And because our pay grades are so off from surrounding states, we can’t attract people to open positions.”
The union began negotiating in January 2024 with the Rhode Island Department of Administration to reclassify some of its members at higher pay grades based on seniority, performance and expanded duties. But the required public hearing needed to make merit-based changes for classified state workers — separate from annual cost-of-living adjustments —- has been on hold for nearly as long.
The state administration puts the blame on a major state software transition that includes its payroll system as reason why it can’t hold the hearings, and in turn, grant raises. The planned upgrade to a cloud-based system does not reflect any serious technical problems with the existing payroll software.
It has also not prevented 11 state department heads from receiving proposed raises within a month (barring formal action from the Rhode Island General Assembly to stop it). Among the cabinet members Gov. Dan McKee wants to give a raise to is RIDOT’s Peter Alviti Jr., whose 2% increase would put his annual base salary at $192,000. That’s more than double the $93,000 Robinson earns, according to the state’s payroll database.
A March 26 public hearing on cabinet raises drew opposition from local union leaders who represent state workers, including Robinson.
“I am not against anybody getting a pay raise, I just want it to be fair and equitable,” Robinson said in a later interview. “Why do my members have to keep suffering because you people don’t have your sh*t together.”
Robinson estimated “hundreds” of classified state workers spanning the state health, education, health and human services departments were not able to negotiate for and receive merit increases for the last year due to the software upgrades. She was unsure of the exact number.
  Under Gov. Dan McKee’s proposal, Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., shown entering the House chamber for McKee’s State of the State on Jan. 14, 2025, would receive a 2% pay raise, bringing his base salary to $192,000 a year.

Bad timing
Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Department of Administration, confirmed in an email that the administration “paused” public hearings on large job classification and pay grade changes during the transition to a new, cloud-based software system. The pause began May 2024 — directly following annual cabinet-level pay raises — and was lifted in March, just in time for the 2025 hearing on department head raises.
Hearings for raises for lower-level state employees like Robinson will happen “later this spring,” Greco said. She did not give a specific date.
Asked how many people were affected by the delays, Greco answered, “Public hearings are held to evaluate job classifications to determine if occupational standards have evolved over time. It is about evaluating positions, not people.”
She declined to say how many positions were affected, noting agencies and local unions were still submitting requests. 
Matthew Gunnip, a case worker with the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families and president of SEIU Local 580, called on the directors slated for raises not to accept them until their employees also received merit-based increases.
“It’s not about who deserves an increase or not, it’s about timing,” said Gunnip, who represents 850 state workers across DCYF, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, among others. “It feels contradictory that the priority of a director’s salary be more important than frontline workers.”

Greco said that proposed raises for department heads can happen only in March of each year under state law. Public hearings for classified state workers in any agency can happen at any time, and there is “no statutorily prescribed cadence.”
Meanwhile, the cost and time to complete the long-awaited modernization of state payroll, finance and other software systems — referred to as the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project —- are growing. McKee proposed revising the state’s current year, fiscal 2025 budget to include $15.8 million more for the project, bringing state spending on the project to $84.5 million, according to a March 21 budget amendment. McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget proposal allocates another $6.7 million to the project for a total cost of $91.2 million.
Transitioning the payroll system from a smattering of individual programs and, in some cases, paper timesheets, to a universal, cloud-based system is now expected to happen by September — nine months later than the original January target. The state plans to return to a regular public hearing schedule for state worker reclassifications once the transition is completed, Greco said.
The explanation puzzled Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the AFL-CIO.
“If they didn’t need the software for department head raises, why do they need it for the rank and file?” Crowley questioned. “I don’t understand that.”

Embracing the modern era
Rhode Island Department of Administration Director Jonathan Womer explained during a March 25 hearing before the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance.
“This is about the time it’s taking us going through 50-plus collective bargaining agreements and rules and regulations around payroll, primarily for employees and how complicated it is to document and put in the system,” Womer said.
Womer insisted it was still a worthwhile and long overdue project, despite repeated increases in the bottom line and completion date.
“We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions,” Womer said. “We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.”
The state’s Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services in a 2019 report called the software transition “less of an opportunity and more of a necessity.” At the time of its strategic plan laying the framework for the transition to a universal cloud system, Rhode Island was one of 12 states that lacked a modern cloud software system, six of which had already begun to implement one, according to the report.
The report highlighted benefits for efficiency, transparency and security, the latter of which was compromised by the aging and uncoordinated systems used by various agencies to track spending, contracts and other financial information.
“The more touchpoints, the more opportunities for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses,” the report stated. “A breach of HR, payroll or financial data has massive economic and reputational costs and consequences.”
Sage advice, especially on the heels of a December 2024 cyberattack on the RIBridges public benefits system, which compromised personal information of up to 650,000 residents.
An audit of the state’s fiscal 2024 financial statements published on March 26 found 28 “material weaknesses” and “control deficiencies” across state agencies deemed of “critical importance” to address by the state auditor general. The administration in its written response to these findings said the ERP system would address many of these deficiencies, according to the report
Of the increasing price tag for the ERP project, Womer said it was “mostly due to having contracts there longer.”










We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions. We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.


– Jonathan Womer, Rhode Island Department of Administration director


A bulk of the funding, $55.5 million with McKee’s proposed budget adjustment, comes from a state account reserved for IT projects based on revenue from selling state land and buildings. A separate restricted receipts account using revenue derived from Division of Motor Vehicles service charges also covers part of the project costs.
Even so, Rep. Alex Marszalkowski, a Cumberland Democrat and second vice chair of the House Committee on Finance, questioned Womer about the rapidly rising cost amid a $250 million forecasted budget deficit for the upcoming fiscal year.
“Now, more than ever, we need to be able to control the controllables,” Marszalkowski said in a later interview. “That’s why you’ll hear me say over and over that projects need to come in on-time and on budget.”
Especially because lawmakers had the same discussion with the administration last year during budget deliberations. 
“We asked them then, ‘what are we doing to ensure this is being rolled out on time?’” Marszalkowski said.
When government IT upgrades fall flat
Delays and rising costs plague government IT projects, including for ERP systems. And completing the software transition doesn’t guarantee results; as few as 13% of large government IT projects succeed, according to a field guide by the U.S. General Services Administration.
In Idaho, a $121 million transition to a similar cloud-based software system called Luma led to payroll issues and failure to properly distribute $100 million in interest payments to state agencies. Since Maine debuted a $30 million software upgrade for its child welfare system in 2022, case workers continue to criticize the program as cumbersome and laborious to use.
Many of the reported problems related to state workers’ abilities to understand and use the new system, a challenge Rhode Island tried to head off by hiring a contractor to train state workers on implementation and usage. The $6.2 million purchase order with Houston-based IT consultant Precision Task Group Inc. was awarded through a competitive bidding process in 2022, the same time as the primary $37.6 million purchase order to Boston-based Accenture LLP, which is providing the subscription to a software called Workday, according to state bidding award documents.
The existing contract for Accenture runs through Sept. 30, while the agreement with Precision covers through the end of 2025.
A third purchase order based on a bid awarded last summer to Deloitte Consulting LLP allocates $600,000 for the consultant to “support the existing payroll team” in transitioning from the current payroll program, ADP, to the new cloud program, Workday, according to the bid documents. Deloitte is the same vendor hired to administer the RIBridges program hacked last year.
Greco sought to separate the work Deloitte was hired to do for the ERP system from its role as the administrator of the RIBridges contract.
“They are not building or managing the system; they are accountants helping with the transition,” she said of the new software contract. “RIBridges is a wholly different project with a completely different scope of work. It’s inaccurate to conflate the two.”
Senate Finance Chair Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat who works as a technical director for Raytheon, was unconcerned by Deloitte’s involvement in the software project.
But he was not assured by the state’s explanation that the ERP project was the reason why state workers’ pay raises had been put on hold. DiPalma was not aware of the situation prior to being interviewed by Rhode Island Current. 
“That should not be the case,” he said. “If they need to do something with regards to appropriately compensating somebody, technology should not be the means by which it is delayed.”
Marszalkowski was similarly uninformed about how the project was affecting public hearings for worker reclassifications. 
“If I had known that would have been one of the first questions I asked during the hearing,” he said.
Robinson has asked leaders of the Department of Administration, multiple times, she said. 
“They’re not willing to give an answer,” she said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Virginia General Assembly is set to reconvene Wednesday for what will likely be a long, one-day session that’s equal parts policymaking and political theater, as lawmakers face off over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s sweeping amendments to 159 bills — including major changes to the state budget.
Youngkin finished acting on all 915 bills sent to him during the 2025 session by last week’s Monday midnight deadline. He signed 599, vetoed 157, and sent back 159 with recommended changes — including a staggering 205 proposed amendments to the budget bill, House Bill 1600, and eight item vetoes.
While many of the vetoes — including on bills to create an adult-use cannabis retail market, raise the minimum wage, allow public-sector unions and tighten how the Virginia Department of Elections processes voter registration data — were expected, none are likely to be overridden. That would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers, and Democrats hold only slim leads: 51-49 in the House, and 21-19 in the Senate.
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Instead, the real legislative drama lies in how lawmakers will handle the governor’s amendments — especially those to the budget and several controversial policy bills that set the stage for a partisan clash that could shape not just legislation, but the narrative heading into this fall’s critical gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst from the University of Mary Washington, offered a candid assessment of Virginia’s current legislative dynamics this year, characterizing both the regular and Wednesday’s veto session as exercises in political positioning rather than substantive governance. 
“This was a kick-the-can-down-the-road legislative session, and it will be a kick-the-can-down-the-road veto session,” he said. 
According to Farnsworth, lawmakers from both sides are focused on shaping narratives ahead of the November elections rather than crafting major policy shifts. 
While he expects the veto session to be largely uneventful — “Veto sessions are usually anti-climactic as long as there is general overall agreement on the shape of the budget, and for the most part there is” — he acknowledged that some amendments might slightly nudge legislation in Youngkin’s favor.
One such example Farnsworth pointed to was the governor’s initiative to explore making Oak Hill, the historic residence of President James Monroe in Fairfax County, a state park. He noted the unusual nature of the proposal, given the region’s political leanings and spending patterns. 
“Republicans don’t often say ‘let’s spend money in Northern Virginia,’” Farnsworth observed, adding that some Democrats might find the idea more palatable than expected: “There might be some Democratic lawmakers who might say it’s easier to say yes to this than no.”
One example of a proposal that is expected to be caught in limbo, however, is HB 1923, which seeks pay parity for midwives. Rather than sign or veto the bill, Youngkin proposed an amendment requiring the Health Insurance Reform Commission to assess the issue and added a reenactment clause — meaning the bill would need to pass again in 2026 to become law.
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

On the matter of cultural competency and unconscious bias training, Youngkin is once again pushing back. For the second year in a row, he’s offered an alternative to Senate Bill 740 by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and HB 1649 by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, which would require medical professionals to complete such training to renew their licenses.
As in 2024, Youngkin’s proposed substitute eliminates references to “unconscious bias” and “cultural competency,” replacing them with language focused on serving populations with high maternal mortality and related health disparities. His version also caps the training at two hours.
While Youngkin has expressed support for expanding access to doulas, his amendment to HB 1614 by Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, and SB 1418 by Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg,  which would allow up to 10 doula visits to be covered by state health insurance, raised eyebrows by changing “birthing people” to “birthing women.” 
Supporters argue the original language was meant to be inclusive, since it reflects the fact that transgender and nonbinary people may become pregnant, groups which Youngkin’s edit excludes.
Youngkin also revised HB 2724 by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, which regulates the use of automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technology. While the bill originally limited data retention to 21 days, his amendment extends that to 30 — a modest expansion that still keeps a firm deletion requirement.
The bill strictly regulates how law enforcement can use ALPR data — only in criminal investigations, missing persons cases, and tracking stolen vehicles or wanted individuals — and requires state approval of all such systems.
In the realm of data centers, Youngkin amended HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, loosening requirements for environmental and noise assessments. 
The original bill required a detailed site analysis before new high-energy -use facilities (HEUFs) could be approved. Youngkin’s version makes that optional for localities and adds flexibility for examining other environmental impacts. He also clarified that the bill wouldn’t take effect unless reenacted in 2026 and wouldn’t interfere with local zoning powers.
Youngkin’s most sweeping changes come in the budget, where he rolled back major Democratic spending priorities.
Youngkin tweaks state budget with eye on federal cuts, but embraces key spending

He also cut $20 million from a proposed rental assistance pilot and removed $15 million designated for a first-time homebuyer grant program. His amendments further eliminate $138 million allocated for school support staff, along with $25 million for HVAC upgrades at Nottoway Correctional Center.
He revived a previously rejected proposal to allocate $25 million for private school scholarships, which would offer $5,000 vouchers to 5,000 low-income families to use toward nonpublic education — a move critics say siphons resources from public schools.
Democrats had proposed tax rebates to return about $1 billion to Virginians. Youngkin pushed instead for structural tax changes, including eliminating the unpopular car tax and exempting tips from taxation — both ideas that were rejected by the legislature.
Still, Youngkin embraced a core Democratic initiative by proposing to make 20% of the Earned Income Tax Credit permanently refundable. Without that change, the enhanced refundability is set to expire in 2027.
He also added controversial language that would withhold state funding from local law enforcement agencies that fail to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Not all of Youngkin’s recommendations were partisan flashpoints. He agreed to send out tax rebate checks — $200 for individuals and $400 for joint filers — and backed bonus payments for public workers. Teachers would receive $1,000 bonuses, while state employees would get 1.5% bonuses on top of their already approved 3% raises starting July 1.
The Democratic majority has the numbers to reject many of Youngkin’s amendments without triggering a budget crisis. Thanks to Virginia’s biennial budget system, state funding is already in place for the fiscal year that begins July 1. However, any budget item rejected by the legislature could still be vetoed individually by the governor.
And Wednesday’s session may not be the last word on the budget. Lawmakers could reconvene later in a special session to address unforeseen federal impacts, such as layoffs or funding cuts, under the terms of a resolution passed earlier this year.

(Photo by Jim Morrison for the Virginia Mercury) For months, Norfolk City Manager Pat Roberts has been warning that Norfolk needs state help funding its $2.66 billion storm risk plan or it will not move forward.
Norfolk’s partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires a local share of $931 million over 10 years for nearly nine miles of floodwalls, natural solutions like grasses and oyster reefs, and raising houses to protect against billions in damages from a major storm.
Norfolk officials signal changes are necessary for floodwall to move forward

 So far, the state has contributed nearly $50 million over two years to the project, half the annual amount sought by the city. There is no money for it in the state’s 2026 budget. Federal funding rules require localities to pay 35% of such projects.
Meanwhile, feasibility studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are moving forward for Hampton and Newport News, Northern Virginia, and Virginia Beach, where a draft plan recently has been shared with the public and the price tag is expected to dwarf the Norfolk cost.
But the commonwealth has no plan for what projects to fund and how. Now, one is in the works. Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, and Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, successfully shepherded House Bill HJ 434, through the General Assembly. The measure, which did not need Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s approval,  authorizes a three-year study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to create a methodology and criteria for state contributions to the local share of federal coastal storm risk management projects like the one approved by Norfolk and in the pipeline elsewhere.
The idea is to give local governments some certainty as they consider the multibillion-dollar partnerships with the U.S. Army Corps. 
“I don’t want to say there’s no rhyme or reason, but there’s certainly not a structure that everyone has sort of agreed upon, and that really is the genesis of this kind of analysis,” Hernandez said. “Knowing that you are going to get a dedicated revenue stream for a certain number of years to help you get across the finish line is tremendously valuable and gives you confidence to move forward at the local level.”
Hernandez said the study will look at the best practices in other states. For Norfolk, which is further along than other cities because it’s signed a partnership agreement with the Army Corps, the study is a lifeline. “Under the status quo, we really don’t have any place to go as a local government to help us with the resources that we need,” said Bryan Pennington, Norfolk’s director of government relations. 
“We hope that they will be able to expedite the conclusions of the study because right now all Virginia local governments are effectively at a competitive disadvantage with all other local governments across the United States because we haven’t clearly articulated what the state’s role is on these federally-funded flood mitigation projects.”
A state policy and fund dedicated to the projects gives localities confidence as their capital improvement budgets evolve to include infrastructure storm risk projects requiring hundreds of millions of dollars.
“Where is this money going to come from?” said Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of Wetlands Watch, a nonprofit based in Norfolk. “If we don’t have a reality check on what future-proofing Virginia’s communities from big storms is going to cost us, then we can’t do the appropriate budget planning that’s necessary to set us up for success in Virginia.
“Once the analysis is completed, our communities will have a better picture of what resources the state is willing to expend to support local projects, and that will then help local governments make difficult decisions about whether to move forward or not, and if they decide to move forward, where will the additional resources come from?” she added. 
Will cities pass bond referendums? Will they enact additional taxes or fees to fill the gap? “These are the types of conversations that our local governments need to be having with their leadership to see if they can afford these types of projects, and then they also need to be having them with the community members if they are going to request that community members pay a share for the protection that the project will provide,” she added. “The reality is that the future will require taxpayers to start paying for these projects if they want to stay living in a high-risk place that’s protected from big storms.”
Pennington noted that Norfolk unsuccessfully requested $50 million this session to cover half of its local share. “We do not have sufficient revenue authorities to raise the funds that are required to unlock this $2.6 billion project,” he said. “Yet we proceed, and we go every single year, asking to the best of our abilities for a reasonable appropriation from the General Assembly because we simply have nowhere else to go.”
Hernandez anticipates there will be ongoing discussions about the funding policy for storm risk plans before the study’s conclusion. The Norfolk project is moving toward the beginning of construction, and the Virginia Beach project is approaching the conclusion of the feasibility study. 
“We’re going to have to think critically with the next governor’s administration to try and work toward that policy, even if we refine it in the coming years because 2028 (when the study is due) is too far out to do nothing,” he said. “These projects are moving forward. We cannot stall out. I don’t want Norfolk to be in a spot where we’re first in line right now and don’t figure it out and are not supporting the project and that makes it go sideways.”
The bill requires JLARC to not only examine what other states are doing, but prioritize projects with nature-based approaches and address socioeconomic inequities.
Those issues have surfaced in Norfolk, where the storm risk plan is the largest infrastructure project in Norfolk’s history. Of the threatened waterfront cities in the U.S., Norfolk is ahead with plans to combat rising waters. The City Council approved a partnership agreement with the Army Corps in 2023, passing an additional resolution promising to seek half its share from the state. 
Residents of the city’s lower-income, largely Black Southside, last year challenged the failure to provide them with floodwalls, noting their home values have been depressed by historical redlining. Critics have long said the benefit-cost analysis used by the Corps values property over people and grey infrastructure over green solutions to the detriment of disadvantaged communities and the environment.
A year later, residents of a wealthier neighborhood on the other side of the Elizabeth River raised the opposite objection. They saw concrete walls rising 11 feet or more through their historic neighborhood as a threat to their enjoyment of the waterfront and lowering their property values.
Stiff notes the focus on nature-based solutions and inequities mirrors recent changes in Army Corps policies promoting green solutions and considering social vulnerability, not just property values, when determining whether the benefit-cost analysis of a project justifies more expensive flood protection measures like concrete floodwalls. It’s unclear whether those focuses will continue under the Trump administration.
The JLARC requirements, Stiff said, are a reminder that resilience doesn’t encompass only protection from a major storm, but from the day-to-day disruptions of tidal flooding and rain bombs created by the climate crisis. “There are alternative ways to protect that may be more agreeable to the public and/or may provide multiple benefits,” she added. “We’re so laser-focused on the protection against big storms, but we forget that we have to be the ones to live with the project once it’s completed, and if the project is only there for the big one and it doesn’t do anything else for us as a community, then it’s a short-sighted or lost opportunity investment.”
The costs for projects like Norfolk’s plan likely will rise, Hernandez acknowledged, and so will any potential state contribution. Without the project, the 2019 Corps plan estimated that all but a sliver of the city’s interior would be at risk for flooding from a major storm by 2075. With the project, the feasibility study says Norfolk will reap annual net benefits of $122 million from reduced damage to businesses, homes, and critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities.  
“There’s an economic cost to inaction as well, and that’s the other part people need to remember,” Hernandez said.

(Photo by Ian Stewart for The Virginia Mercury)During fiscal year 2024, almost 11 million riders rode the bus in Richmond, or used paratransit, or LINK Microtransit services, according to the Greater Richmond Transit Company, an increase of 14% percent over last year. That boost is almost certainly due to GRTC’s zero-fare program that has allowed people to catch rides for free. 
But the program, which started during the pandemic, may be eliminated this summer, if a funding gap isn’t closed.
To spur corporations and the public into action, the non-profit advocacy group RVA Rapid Transit released a report last week at the University of Richmond’s Queally Center. 
Called, “Free to Move: The Role of Zero-Fare Transit in Advancing Health and Justice in Richmond,” the report breaks down the history of zero-fare, the demographics of riders and how the funding gap could damage ridership.
 ‘The need for accessible transit is urgent’

Faith Walker, executive director of RVA Rapid Transit, said her group spoke to 100 bus riders about how zero fare transit plays a critical role in their lives. Their report shows a funding need of $6.8 million for next year.
“The report clearly outlines the impact of fare free public transit, connecting individuals to jobs, health care, education, and essential services,” she said, “while contributing to reduced carbon emissions and more sustainable urban development. The need for accessible transit is urgent and we must act now to sustain and expand this vital service.”
The need Walker spoke of is a daily reality for Aqiyla McMillan, who has been riding the bus for more than a year, after her car broke down and an injury also sidelined her from driving. 
“I had a surgery, so I had to start getting around, getting to doctor’s appointments, getting to physical therapy, getting the kids to school,” said McMillan. “So I got on the bus one day thinking I had to pay and they were like, ‘Oh, no, the bus is free.’”
McMillan said not having to pay for the bus on a regular basis has been a lifesaver.
“I would have never been able to do that if there was fare on the bus,” she said.

 Where funding comes from 

The transit service gets funding from a variety of sources, including state and federal grants. Separate funding injections come from nearby localities and from the Central Virginia Transit Authority. But these funding sources help cover GRTC’s entire budget, not just the zero-fare program, according to spokesperson Ashley Potter.
A state grant of $8 million from the Virginia Department of Rail & Public Transportation (DRPT) called the Transit Ridership Incentive Program (TRIP) launched GRTC’s zero-fare ridership at the end of 2021. The purpose was to study and implement zero-fare service for a limited time, according to GRTC. Over a three year period, the funding would dwindle to zero.
The net cost for the zero- fare program for that time period was $20.4 million, according to Mass Transit, a trade publication. That’s after removing $1.2 million for fare collection costs. 
With the $8 million TRIP grant in place, other funding sources had to come forward to make the $20 million mark. So Virginia Commonwealth University stepped up to contribute $3.8 million, and GRTC ponied up $8.56 million in funds. The city of Richmond also contributed some funds. 
Knowing the DRPT grant was set to expire, GRTC launched a Transit Access Partnership program in 2023 to seek out other corporate sponsors and individuals to help sustain zero-fare ridership.
“Our focus for zero-fare and our TAP program has been at the forefront of what we’ve been doing over the last couple of months,” said Sheryl Adams, GRTC’s chief executive officer. “So, with the TAP program anyone can contribute. If you’re an organization, you can do a tax write-off through our 501C, which is Ride Finders.”
Torres said to help keep the program afloat, GRTC has also been seeking a variety of new sources.
“We have kind of gone after several paths to keep it sustained for the next year,” said Torres. “We’ve applied for a congestion mitigation air quality grant and that’s $2 million.”
New revenue from an expanded advertising program will also help with zero-fare funding, said Torres, who hopes to get up to two million dollars from it.
“We worked with the city and they did a franchise agreement, which now allows us to do advertising basically in any right of way, so not just at the pole stations, but at bus stops, shelters, poles, benches. We’ve also expanded the ability to advertise on our vehicles,” she said.
Adrienne Torres, the bus company’s chief of staff, said they’ve also been looking through their budget to see where else they can help with funds for the program.“We feel like we’re pretty close. Like I said, we have zero-fare in there for this year, but we still need to continue to have support for it,” she said. “Our grant applications are still pending. So hopefully we’ll know for sure in the next month or two where we are. Our budget’s going to go to the board in May. We have a strategy and a plan that hopefully will come to fruition for FY2026.”
Walker hopes her group’s new report on zero fare encourages everyone, from the members of the public to those with legislative power, to do all they can to help keep the service running. 
“I am calling on elected officials, employers, transit riders, environmentalists and everyday Richmonders to support the future of zero-fare transit through the GRTC Transit Access Partnership Program and their advertisement program,” said Walker. “It’s time to champion tap funding and ensure continued support for zero fare transit services.”

(Photo courtesy of Annie Watson of Sheepscot Valley Farm)Annie Watson, who along with her husband runs Sheepscot Valley Farm, expects the cost of organic grain imported from Canada to increase by as much as $100 per ton under new tariffs. That would mean an additional $1,200 to $1,400 a month to feed the 70 cows they milk the Whitefield dairy operation.
“Regardless of the size of our herds or whether we are first generation farmers or 10th generation dairy farmers, dairy farmers are facing the rising costs from tariffs,” she said. 
As president of the Maine Dairy Industry Association, Watson joined other leaders from Maine’s farming and craft beer industries who spoke Tuesday about their looming concerns for the next round of tariffs. While they worry increased costs could be passed onto consumers, the tariffs also come after many farms have already planned for the season ahead meaning higher prices could eat away at their already thin profit margins. 
The agriculture sector, like many Maine industries concerned by a potential trade war, is deeply interconnected with the state’s northern neighbor. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods. 
President Donald Trump’s latest round of taxes on imports, set to take effect Wednesday, includes “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products. Since taking office in January, he has imposed new tariffs on China, as well as on certain goods from Canada and Mexico that could be expanded. He’s also added a tariff on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday and raised the tax on foreign steel and aluminum.
The “on again, off again” tariff discussion that has colored the first few months of the Trump administration have left farmers in a state of limbo, waiting to see what will actually be imposed, how it will affect them and what decisions they will need to make in response, said Sarah Alexander, executive director of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.
Alexander knows of one farm that planned to build another greenhouse this year, but has put that project on hold because the construction cost has already gone up by 50% due to the tariffs on steel and aluminum. 
In addition to the cost of feed grain and fertilizer that Watson predicts will be affected, farmers could see prices increase for fuel and other resources they need to keep their operations running, Alexander said. Maine’s craft breweries have significant concerns about the tariff on aluminum, given how much of their product is sold in cans, said Sarah Bryan, executive director of the Maine Brewers Guild. 
Alexander also said the tariffs could impact processing costs for the wild blueberry industry that is so integrated between Maine and Canada.
With these concerns echoed by farmers across the country, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said Monday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
While Trump argues tariffs will encourage more domestic buying, Watson said degraded rail infrastructure makes it near impossible to transport all the grain that would be needed for farms in Maine from the Midwest or other parts of the country, especially with Canada so close. 
Dairy farmers like Watson don’t have control over the prices their products are sold at, so she said they could go deeper into debt or cut corners, like feeding cows less grain, which could lead to fertility and production issues for the animals. 
“I think our farmers are going to navigate how long can they hold off on passing through any of these increased prices to consumers, if possible,” Alexander said. But “ultimately that means it’s going to come out of the profitability of the farm.”

Last month, the Norfolk City Council requested the city’s school board to prepare an action plan to close and consolidate 10 schools before the start of the 2026-2027 school year. The move would help “reinvest savings into major school capital improvement and maintenance projects” the council said, including at Maury and Booker T. Washington High Schools, and three new elementary schools slated to replace aging buildings. 
Norfolk City Public Schools operates five high schools, six middle schools and 30 elementary schools.
Depending on the plan, the city’s move could be the most significant action taken to close and/or consolidate public schools in the commonwealth’s history. During the 2014-15 school year, Alexandria City Public Schools consolidated five middle and elementary schools within its two larger school buildings. However Norfolk’s plan shapes up, its ripple effects will be felt far and wide, some education leaders say.
“Closing any school in any school division is a significant leadership challenge for a superintendent as they work with their school board, their students and staff and their entire community,” said Scott Brabrand, a former public school superintendent and now executive director for the Virginia Association of School Superintendents.
In its March 25 resolution, the council directed the school board to “prioritize achieving these savings” when developing an action plan by Aug. 1 to close a minimum of two schools per year afterward.
The council warned the board that if a plan is not provided in a timely way, it would modify its funding allocations to the school division. The adjustment would then allow the council to prevent any further funding from being utilized at schools that are not operating at full capacity.
According to the Norfolk City Council’s resolution, the locality contributed $164.2 million to the school division for the current school year, which excludes costs for capital projects.
Enrollment at Norfolk City Public Schools had declined to approximately 26,000 students at the start of this school year, down from 32,000 students during the 2014-2015 school year, according to data from the Virginia Department of Education. The city projects that enrollment will continue to decrease, reaching around 24,000 students by the next school year.
“The council acknowledges the difficult choices the school board faces; nonetheless, eliminating unneeded buildings must be a priority addressed immediately,” the resolution states.
 ‘Never an easy decision’

Franklin ​​County Public Schools Superintendent Kevin Siers said consolidating schools is challenging, after recently completing a process to consolidate two schools in his division. 
“It’s never an easy decision and our school board took the role seriously,” Siers said in an interview.
County and school board leaders had a tough time weighing public input against the roles the schools played in each community, while the school division had 44 empty classrooms over 11 elementary schools, a $3.7 million loss in state funding and significant changes to the local composite index, a measurement of a locality’s ability to pay education costs.
Siers also added that the division would have faced cutting 70 positions.
“We had school board members who really struggled with it, especially those who lived in the communities where the schools were closing,” Siers said. “But in the end, we knew that we had to take some type of action, because the alternative was much more grim than closing two schools.”
Months after the decision, Siers was happy to report that because of the decision to consolidate two elementary schools, the division was able to place an art teacher, music teacher, physical education teacher and counselor at each of the 10 elementary schools, which Siers believes has “improved the culture at every elementary school by being able to have these additional personal personnel there full time, every day.”
 The plan

Norfolk City Public Schools plans to rebuild four schools and consolidate four additional ones. However, the division faces increased costs, including for Maury High School, whose cost estimate jumped from $150 million to $250 million.
Since 2013, a report by Cooperative Strategies has indicated that Norfolk City Public Schools has consistently operated three to 17 more schools than necessary for its population each year. The consulting firm, which analyzed the division’s capacity, estimated that the school division could have saved $81 million between 2013 and 2023.
“This isn’t about just closing schools, but it’s about right-sizing so that we can provide better resources, better buildings, and to be able to use those additional resources,” said Norfolk City Councilor Carlos J. Clanton at the March 25 meeting.
He added that he supported passing the resolution to ensure the school board knows it has the council’s backing, and to encourage the division to complete the report.
“Council is doing its part, and we need the school board to do theirs,” he said.
The school board will have a work session on April 2 and a regular meeting on April 23. Recently, the school division announced that it has created a planning committee tasked with reviewing the division’s facilities.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

On April 2nd, the Supreme Court of the United States will hear oral arguments in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The case addresses whether Medicaid beneficiaries can seek relief in federal court to enforce Medicaid’s “free-choice of provider provision,” which allows Medicaid beneficiaries to seek care from any provider that is qualified and willing to participate in the program.
While the case focuses on this specific question, it has its origins in broader efforts by anti-abortion policymakers to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from the Medicaid program and, ultimately, eliminate all federal payments to Planned Parenthood centers. In this brief, we describe the case, the Medicaid policies underlying it, and potential implications for Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to reproductive health services.
 What is the case in front of the Supreme Court about?

The Supreme Court’s review of this case is limited to one question: Can a Medicaid beneficiary bring a civil action to enforce the Medicaid Act’s free choice of provider? This question is similar to one that the Court decided in 2023 (Health and Hospital Corp of Marion County v. Talevski ) when it ruled (7-2) that patients do have a private right of action to enforce certain conditions that federal Medicaid law imposes on states and health care providers.
However, the current case involves a different provision of federal law relating to free choice of provider under the Medicaid Act. Planned Parenthood and the individual beneficiary who has brought this case take the position that Medicaid beneficiaries meet the requirements to sue in order to enforce the free choice of provider provision. The Trump administrationhas weighed in on the side of South Carolina, contending that Medicaid beneficiaries should not be permitted to bring an action to enforce this provision.
In 2018, South Carolina’s Governor McMaster (R) issued an executive order prohibiting any clinic that provides abortion care from participating in the state’s Medicaid program. The order states that the state funds used to reimburse providers could be used to indirectly subsidize abortion care even though Medicaid only pays for non-abortion family planning services. The executive order had a direct impact on the Planned Parenthood clinics that offer abortion services in the state (South Carolina limits abortion to up to six weeks of pregnancy) but also offer enrollees other Medicaid-covered services including contraceptive care and STI screening and treatment. The state has historically reimbursed these providers for the non-abortion medical care they provide to Medicaid enrollees just like it pays for all other medical care. The federal Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal funds (including Medicaid) from being used to pay for abortions unless the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest or endangers the life of the pregnant person.
States operate Medicaid programs under federal guidance, and one of the federal provisions of the Medicaid law is known as free choice of provider. This provision states that “A State plan for medical assistance must… provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance… may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required… who undertakes to provide him such services.” Additionally, because many states require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care, limiting their care to a defined network of providers, federal law states that beneficiaries may seek care from any Medicaid provider for family planning services specifically, even those outside the plan network.
The larger context for this case involves how a state determines who is a qualified provider, even though the Supreme Court is more narrowly focusing on private right of action. The statute does not define the word “qualified,” but longstanding federal regulations, recognize states’ authority to “set reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.” The final lines of the regulation say that States need not provide payments to providers with certain felony convictions. The regulations and a separate provision contemplate that “[i]n addition to any other authority, a State may exclude” any provider from Medicaid for certain reasons “for which the Secretary could exclude” the provider from participating in Medicare.
In 2016, in a “Dear Medicaid Director letter” issued during the Obama administration, CMS wrote that states have the authority to set standards that providers must meet, but to disqualify a willing provider, the state must have a legitimate reason such as concerns about the fitness of the provider to meet the standards or evidence of fraud. It went on to say that states cannot target a specific provider and “The failure of a state to apply otherwise reasonable standards in an evenhanded manner may suggest such targeting.” CMS went on to say that “states may not deny qualification to family planning providers…solely because they separately provide…abortion or another service that the state does not approve of.” This letter was rescinded by the Trump administration in 2018. Whether it be through the Courts or through administrative actions, this issue will likely continue to be debated and legally challenged for the foreseeable future.
The Supreme Court, however, is only considering whether Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to bring a case to enforce their right to choose their provider. The Court is not considering whether South Carolina acted properly when it excluded Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, deeming them “unqualified” because they provide abortion services as well as other reproductive health care services. If the Supreme Court finds that Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to bring an action to enforce their right to choose any provider, the case will then go back down to the district court to determine whether South Carolina acted within its authority to exclude Planned Parenthood as a nonqualified provider. If the Supreme Court rules that Medicaid beneficiaries do not have a private right of action, then Planned Parenthood itself could appeal South Carolina’s decision that found them to be an unqualified provider.
 How have courts ruled about private right of action for Medicaid beneficiaries in other cases?

A civil rights statute, Section 1983, has long provided a mechanism for individuals to enforce the rights provided to them under federal programs, including Medicaid. There is a long history of litigation related to private enforcement of the Medicaid Act. While courts have affirmed the authority for individuals to use Section 1983 to protect Medicaid rights, the Supreme Court has issued decisions that have narrowed this authority. Currently there is a three-pronged test (pursuant to the cases Blessing v Freestone (1997), Gonzaga University v. Doe (2002), and Health & Hosp. Corp of Marion County v. Talevski(2023)) based on legal precedent that courts use to evaluate whether a federal law establishes an enforceable right:

whether the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute;
whether the plaintiff’s asserted interests are specific enough to be enforced; and
whether the statute imposes a binding obligation on the State.

In Talevski, the most recent Supreme Court case to consider this right, the high court reaffirmed the holdings in Gonzaga that a statutory provision is enforceable under Section 1983 when the provision is “phrased in terms of the persons benefits” and contains “right-creating individual centric language with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.”
Federal circuit courts have generally upheld private enforcement of rights for Medicaid enrollees. Before the Supreme Court Talevski ruling in 2023, there was a split among circuit court rulings. In 2019 there were four circuit court opinions that all ruled in favor of beneficiaries’ right to enforce Medicaid provisions. However, in 2020, three of four circuit court decisions did not rule in favor of Medicaid enrollees, including one decision from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled in favor of Texas’ decision to exclude Planned Parenthood. Until the Medina case, the Supreme Court had previously refused to review multiple cases in which Planned Parenthood patients were found to have an enforceable right. An earlier version of the Medina case, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic v. Baker, went up to the Supreme Court but was denied review. This is the first time the current configuration of the Supreme Court will hear a case involving Planned Parenthood.
While this case is narrowly focused on whether Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to sue to enforce their right to choose any willing, qualified provider, the Supreme Court’s decision will have implications for the many states wishing to exclude providers, such as Planned Parenthood, based on abortion politics and not based on clinical qualifications to provide medical services. If Medicaid beneficiaries cannot bring an action to enforce the free choice of provider provision, then states will have greater latitude to exclude providers, such as Planned Parenthood, based on political objections.
 What does this case mean for Medicaid beneficiaries?

This case has the potential to curtail low-income individuals’ access to preventive reproductive health care in South Carolina and potentially in many states in the nation. The Medicaid program covers one in five reproductive age women and is the largest source of coverage for women with low incomes, covering over four in ten (Figure 1). All state Medicaid programs must cover family planning services, which includes contraceptive care plus a range of related services such as physical exams, cancer screenings, pregnancy testing and counseling, and screenings for other conditions. Medicaid is an essential source of financing for safety-net clinics and is widely considered to be the largest single public payer of family planning services. KFF research has found that specialty reproductive health care clinics such as Planned Parenthood centers offer a broader range of services to their patients compared to non-specialized clinics.
Other states are likely to follow suit if the Court rules in South Carolina’s favor. In fact, several other states, such as Texas, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri have tried to keep Planned Parenthood clinics out of their Medicaid networks, and while some of these efforts were blocked by CMS and courts because they violate the free choice of provider requirements, there have been exceptions. Federal courts upheld Arkansas and Texas decisions excluding Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. South Carolina filed a waiver application to CMS during the first Trump Administration to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from their Medicaid program, and Tennessee also has a similar waiver pending. No action has been taken to date on these waivers.
Blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements or other public funds has been shown to reduce low-income women’s access to contraceptives. In 2013, Texas replaced its Medicaid family planning program with a 100% state funded program that excluded Planned Parenthood as a participating provider. Following the policy change, there was a sizable drop in Medicaid claims for long-acting contraceptives such as IUDs or implants, and injectable contraceptives and an increase in Medicaid-funded births.
 What is next?

The federal Solicitor General was granted approval to participate in oral arguments and has taken the position of South Carolina in this case. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on April 2nd and is expected to issue a ruling by the end of the term in June 2025.

The hypocritical double standards at work on the modern political right these days are often enough to make your head spin. Just think what Fox News shouters would be saying right now if a Kamala Harris administration had committed an outrageous breach of national security like the one Trump’s defense team did recently by divulging details of planned military operation.
And the same hypocrisy would undoubtedly apply closer to home as well.
Just imagine if Gov. Josh Stein — who controls the state budget office — did what Trump is doing by issuing directives to budget officials to simply cancel government funded programs authorized in a duly enacted budget.
Funding for school vouchers and crisis pregnancy centers? Gone. New programs at council of state departments led by Republicans? Canceled.
Republican lawmakers loyal to Trump would be apoplectic.
The bottom line: Gov. Stein would never take such action because he’s an honest and responsible leader who believes in the rule of law. Would that Trump and the political puppets he controls were of the same character.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)In New Hampshire, timber is considered taxable real estate. But since that tax is assessed at the time of harvesting, some worry carbon programs that keep trees standing for decades to offset emissions could cut into local revenue.
A group of lawmakers have proposed a fix, House Bill 123, which they say would simply allow revenue from such programs to be taxed the same as felled trees. The bill comes after action last session to establish a registry of properties in the state enrolled in carbon programs, and amid ongoing debate over the management of the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters forest in the northern part of the state. 
“Our world has and continues to change,” said Rep. Mike Ouellet, a Colebrook Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, at a hearing for the bill. “HB 123 is nothing more than a reflection of today’s varying timber market.”
The bill faced some pushback from conservation and business groups when it was introduced. It came out of the House Municipal and County Government Committee with a unanimous, 18-0, recommendation that the full chamber pass it with an amendment. But last month, Republican Majority Leader Jason Osborne moved to table it. The Auburn Republican called the issue “important,” but suggested it would be better to wait until the Department of Revenue Administration finished a related report later this year.
His motion failed, 171-185, and the House passed the amended bill, 197-158. Now, it awaits further action in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
Rep. Arnold Davis, a Milan Republican, said when introducing the bill that it had two goals: to keep municipalities “whole,” since the tax is retained locally, and to put timber harvesting on “a fair playing field” with carbon credit projects. 
Davis and other supporters of the bill said it was not a new tax, but simply a new branding of the same tax. Some opponents, though, disagreed, and said it created a tax on carbon credit programs where none currently exists. 
“This is not a new tax. It is still timber tax,” Davis said. “It is simply a way to keep a fairly new way of doing business from circumventing around paying their property tax to the towns, and to push for best forestry management practices.”
Technically, under current state law, standing timber can be taxed when assessors determine a municipality is “unreasonably deprived of revenue because of the failure of an owner” to cut down timber that has “arrived at the degree of maturity most suitable for its use.”
But Davis said this section of the law has never been invoked, and felt the bill provided a simpler avenue to collect the revenue. Before the timber tax was enacted decades ago, officials would visit properties to assess the value of the standing trees — a “cumbersome” and likely inaccurate process, and one property owners could circumvent by chopping down their trees, Davis said. 
Now, and for the better part of the past century, property owners are charged a 10% yield tax upon cutting down timber after a certain amount and under certain circumstances. This made the process simpler for assessors and more accurate, Davis said. 
While that system worked for decades, Davis said, carbon programs have changed the landscape. He pitched the bill as a way to adapt and close what he called a “loophole.”
The bill would require landowners to pay an annual yield tax of 10% of the “estimated net value of the carbon offset credits issued and sold in the previous calendar year.” Similarly, the state’s timber tax is 10% of the “stumpage value” — the value of the timber at the time it is cut, as determined by assessing officials. In 2023, it brought in over $3.4 million across the state, according to the Department of Revenue Administration. 
Right now, at least nine property owners in the state are enrolled in carbon programs, according to the latest version of the state registry. Collectively, they amount to more than 186,000 acres, with the smallest property enrolled standing at 122 acres in Hillsborough County, and the largest being more than 141,000 acres of the Connecticut Lakes forest in Coös County. One project has a minimum duration of 20 years, four are listed at 40 years, and the other four — including the Connecticut Lakes forest — at 100 years. 
Aurora Sustainable Lands, the owner of the Connecticut Lakes forest, has voiced opposition to this session’s legislation. 
Meredith Hatfield, associate director for policy and government relations with The Nature Conservancy, raised concerns when the legislation was introduced that it “would undermine efforts to encourage sustainable forestry and could penalize landowners who seek to keep forests as forests to provide a broader range of benefits to the state, its residents, and visitors.” Like Osborne, she suggested lawmakers wait for the Department of Revenue Administration’s final report on the topic before taking action. 
Meanwhile, Executive Councilor Joseph Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, said the bill was about “fairness.” Kenney, whose district includes the northern chunk of the state where debate on carbon programs has been especially prominent, said the bill would make it so that large property owners can’t “escape” being taxed. 
“We just want fairness, through this bill, throughout the state,” Kenney said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woodstimbertax-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.











They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin



The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
Opposing sides
At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.











The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas



Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
Rural support
But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
Solar energy and its cheaper bills are coming to more disadvantaged communities

State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/02/committee-set-to-vote-on-lower-limits-on-child-sex-abuse-lawsuits/,The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote Wednesday on an amended version of a bill that could limit the state's financial liability stemming from claims of institutional abuse.,"House Judiciary Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) said the amended bill on child sexual abuse claims is ""fairly close to being a place where I don't know that everybody's totally happy or totally unhappy, which is ... our goal from time to time."" (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote Wednesday on an amended version of a bill that could limit the state’s financial liability stemming from claims of institutional abuse.
The amendments to House Bill 1378 would lower the maximum payout claims for thousands of plaintiffs who said they were abused as children while in state custody.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who sponsored the 2023 law that first opened the door to the lawsuits as well as this year’s bill to contain them, said he backs the changes.

“I think it strikes a good balance, without a doubt,” Wilson said. “We are kind of fishing for ways to do it — what’s best, what’s constitutional? I think we came up with a very good balance. I think it allows the plaintiffs to keep going. So, yeah, I think that it does definitely strike a good balance.”
But the bill, which had a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee last week, faces a tight deadline for passage.
The General Assembly ends its work at midnight, April 7. The bill must get out of the House Judiciary and through a preliminary and final vote by the full House of Delegates, before beginning again in the Senate.
Sources said passing the bill this year gets tougher if it’s not in the Senate by Thursday.
The subject matter of the bill is emotionally charged. That and concerns about potential litigation could attract lengthy committee and floor debates.
Budget-hawk Republicans on the committee worried the amended bill focuses on limiting the costs to the state rather than focusing on the victims.
“It seems what we’re doing right now is we’re saying, ‘How can we protect the state and the budget?'” Del. Robin L. Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County), said during a Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday.

“I’m not sure how a different level of justice for public versus private makes these people whole,” Grammer said. “And in this moment, it very much seems like we’re not thinking of these folks. We’re actually saying, ‘What are we going to do about the budget?’ So, I just don’t feel comfortable with this at all.”
The Child Victims Act, passed in 2023, made it easier for adults who were sexually abused as children to sue the institutions that protected their alleged abusers. The bill eliminated time restrictions on filing lawsuits both against private institutions but also state and local governments.
That law also capped claims against private institutions at $1.5 million per occurrence. Claims against public institutions – state and local government agencies – are capped at $890,000 per occurrence.
One group of lawyers claiming to represent 5,000 plaintiffs has been in negotiations with the state since 2023 with claims under that law. The total potential liability for those claims has not been made public but could easily be in the billions.
Wilson said he filed this year’s bill in an attempt to reconcile the need for survivors to bring their cases to court, while addressing the unintended, potentially bankrupting consequences facing the Maryland government.
His bill would have lowered the cap on claims against the state from $890,000 to $400,000. Additionally, it proposed limiting payouts to an individual claimant regardless of the number of alleged instances of abuse.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The amended bill changes the maximum payout for cases against public and private institutions beginning June 1. Claims filed before the effective date would be subject to the current law.
Claims against private institutions, such as private schools or religious institutions, would be capped at $700,000. Claims against government agencies would be capped at $400,000.
The amendments also eliminate the “per occurrence” multiplier that exposes the state to billions in potential liabilities. Similar claims forced the Archdiocese of Baltimore to preemptively seek bankruptcy protection before the 2023 law took effect.
Should the amended bill pass, “all of the different occurrences would be happening under one umbrella,” said House Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City).
Maximum payouts under that “umbrella” would be limited to $700,000 or $400,000 total.
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford), speaking during a committee meeting, said the lower cap was too low.

“Six thousand dollars a year is offensively low given these children could not escape their abusers,” Arikan said, basing her estimates on a boy abused as a teen who lives to the average life expectancy for a male.
Attorney’s fees in such cases would also be limited — 20% for out of court settlements and 25% if the case goes to court.
The amended bill asks the state judiciary to adopt rules to handle the influx of cases.
“In other words, basically signaling to them: Hey, you’re going to have a number of cases. You should probably look to get together and draft rules,” Clippinger said.
The bill asks the court system to provide the legislature with an annual report on resolved cases, including the amounts paid out and a summary of the underlying claims in each case.
One of the most problematic portions of the bill as introduced was language that placed limits on damages retrospectively.
Initially, lawmakers said they received assurances from Attorney General Anthony Brown that the change would be legal. But the decision to strike the retroactive language in spite of those assurances indicates they were less certain about those claims.
“I’ve heard a lot from a lot of different people over the last week,” Clippinger said. “I think that is fairly close to being a place where I don’t know that everybody’s totally happy or totally unhappy, which is, as has been stated, our goal from time to time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0064-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) discusses amendments for House Bill 503. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The House voted 104-15 Tuesday for what started as Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) priority housing legislation but which was so heavily amended that the not even the original name remains.
What began as the governor’s “Housing for Jobs Act” will now head to the Senate as the “Housing Development Act” – with nearly every component of the bill that tied housing development to job growth stricken.
The heavily amended House Bill 503 now prompts the Department of Housing and Community Development to set 10-year housing targets for the state, its counties and every municipality, and report on their progress annually.
“It allows our entire state to work together to make sure that each jurisdiction has a role … in showing how to produce the housing that our people need,” said Del. Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) during debate on the House  floor. “Our state is 96,000 housing units short. We’re not serving the needs of our constituents. This bill allows us to do that.”
Most of the changes adopted by the House were first introduced in the House Environment and Transport Committee last week.
When introduced in January, the governor’s bill was framed as an expansion on his housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying project requests in areas where the state determined there was an imbalance between housing and jobs.
House members overhaul Moore housing bill with ‘simpler’ amendments

The bill did not get its first hearing until March, but representatives from the counties and others quickly expressed “significant” concerns, particularly over the bill’s language that would have forced counties to approve housing in some situations.
Under the amended bill approved Tuesday, each jurisdiction would have a hand in creating those targets and would consider estimates for future employment and housing demand along with population growth and other considerations.
The bill also creates so-called “vesting rights” so that a housing developer with an approved project proposal would retain the right to develop the property for at least five years, or a period granted by the local jurisdiction or the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, whichever is longer.
The legislation creates a new Housing Opportunities Made Equitable Commission — the HOME Commission — a group of various stakeholders that would study the housing crisis in the state and make recommendations to lawmakers to address the issue.
During a floor session Tuesday morning, Del. Christopher T. Adams (R-Lower Shore) secured one amendment to add a residential real estate owner to the commission, which was seen as a friendly amendment and accepted into the bill.
Other Republican amendments were not as lucky.
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), noting that “quite a bit of the bill was stricken in the reprint,” offered an amendment to opt Baltimore County out of the provisions of the legislation. She said the county is more proactive in setting future housing plans than what the bill would require.
“We are, in Baltimore County, setting these targets and these goals on a local level through our county council that does a great job of doing this every four years,” Szeliga said. “I don’t think that the state setting housing goals should be preemptive over the local county. My county councilman does an amazing job, as do all seven of them. I prefer to leave this in the hands of our local government and not have the state override that.”
With clock ticking, lawmakers still hope to iron out issues on Moore’s housing bill

Lewis argued that the bill does not attempt to override any local planning efforts but calls on the counties to work with state housing officials to set local targets that would help boost housing supply in their unique areas.
“These targets are non-binding, and the process for having each jurisdiction work with the department actually sets up a really strong and regulatory consistency standard,” Lewis said. “So that, across our state, we’re all working together to make sure that each jurisdiction builds and produces the amount of housing it uniquely needs on a timeline, supported and encouraged by the Department and the HOME commission.
“This is not a preemption bill,” she said. “We, the committee, understood very well the concerns about that.”
Szeliga’s amendment failed on party lines, as did another proposed by Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) that would have restricted local jurisdictions from approving new housing projects in areas where schools are overcrowded.
Despite the hefty changes, the Moore administration has previously expressed support for the new direction of the legislation, saying it still “moves the needle” toward the governor’s goal of boosting housing supply in the state.
Senators will need to take a look at what is essentially a brand new bill than the Senate version they last considered in early March. With just days left in session, senators will need to work quickly to pass the legislation out of committee and before the full chamber before Sine Die on Monday.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02423-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 04:58:59.359349

Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro testified against Ohio Senate Bill 127 Tuesday morning during the Ohio Senate Education Committee meeting. The bill would revise Ohio’s public school closure law and require a poor performing school to either close or take remedial action.

“S.B. 127 proposes a heavy handed and overreaching state approach to local schools that receive low ratings on state report cards,” DiMauro said. “The impact of the actions compelled by S.B. 127 would harm students and communities. The harsh measures required by the bill ignore mitigating factors, forcing districts to make counterproductive decisions that could harm well-functioning schools.”
Senate Education Committee Chair Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, introduced the bill last month and no one has submitted supporter testimony for the bill yet. Five people submitted opponent testimony while the Buckeye Institute and the pro-charter-school Thomas B. Fordham Institute submitted interested party testimony.

S.B. 127 defines a poor performing school as a school (district-operated, community or STEM), serving grades four and older, that has performed in the bottom 5% among public schools based on its Performance Index Score for three consecutive years, and is in the bottom 10% based on its Value-Added Progress for three consecutive years. 
A poor-performing school would have the option to close at the end of the school year or replace its principal and a majority of licensed staff. Another option is the school could get the help of an Ohio Department of Education and Workforce management organization, charter management organization, education service center, or an Ohio public or private university with experience in school improvement. 
Ohio charter schools are automatically closed if they have three straight years of poor performance. 
“Instead of offering significant support, S.B. 127 proposes significant punishments that will most likely destabilize schools where many great things are happening, even if those successes are not revealed on data printouts of standardized test scores,” DiMauro said. “The barriers to learning caused by under-resourced schools and communities do not disappear when a state punishes a school district.
Greg R. Lawson, a research fellow at the Buckeye Institute, said the bill addresses chronic underperformance in public schools. 
“Critics worry that closures may disrupt communities, but trapping students in the status quo cycle of underachieving schools is far more disruptive to students and their futures,” he said. 
Thomas B. Fordham Institute’s Vice President for Ohio Policy Chad Aldis said he would support the bill if a few tweaks were made including revising the growth measure to the Ohio report card one-star rating on Value Added Progress.
“This is a clearer and more stable indicator of inadequate growth, and it better reflects the state’s own definition of “low performance,” Aldis said. “Combining this with a bottom 5% Performance Index score would ensure that only schools with sustained low achievement and weak student progress are flagged— exactly as intended.”

But on Monday night they said they&#8217;re continuing their work to root out anticompetitive practices by health care companies. Then on Tuesday came news that some of their work against insulin manufacturers could be unraveling as a result of Trump&#8217;s actions. [&#8230;],"One of the entrances to the Federal Trade Commission Building in Washington, DC, that serves as the headquarters of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).President Donald Trump is trying to fire two members of the Federal Trade Commission. But on Monday night they said they’re continuing their work to root out anticompetitive practices by health care companies.
Then on Tuesday came news that some of their work against insulin manufacturers could be unraveling as a result of Trump’s actions.
Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya appeared in a virtual health care roundtable aimed at highlighting ways in which corporate concentration in that sector is driving up prices and hurting patients. 
The event was sponsored by the group Fight Corporate Monopolies. And it appeared that part of the purpose was to show that Slaughter and Bedoya were still on the job as they fight Trump in court. Critics say the president’s attempt in March to fire the Democratic commissioners was a corrupt favor to tech billionaires who bankrolled Trump’s campaign and his inauguration.
Antitrust advocates: Trump’s FTC firings are a favor to his billionaire buddies 

Monday’s roundtable had to do with concerns Trump himself has expressed — that huge health care conglomerates are using middlemen and other practices to drive up the cost of drugs and other care.
Alvaro Bedoya, who was appointed to the FTC by former President Joe Biden, said increasing corporate control of the health sector is partly responsible for the fact that Americans pay by far the most for care, yet have among the worst health outcomes among developed nations.
“The state of American health care is shameful and embarrassing — the impact it has on regular people,” he said. “It’s shameful and embarrassing what happens when people get a cancer diagnosis. They’re forced to fundraise from friends and family as many of them go bankrupt. It’s shameful and embarrassing that life expectancy in this country is years (less) than what it could be. It’s even more embarrassing that people living paycheck-to-paycheck have even more years taken away from them.”
He added, “It’s hard to look at the system and not see that at least some substantial part of those problems are caused by concentration and consolidation in the health care industry.”
Among the things Bedoya and Slaughter did to get a grasp of the situation was in 2022 to order a study of the conduct of pharmacy middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. The biggest three are part of the conglomerates UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, and Cigna-Express Scripts. They handle nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. 
Last July, the FTC released an interim report saying that the companies appeared to be improperly pushing up prices and hurting patients. Then in October, the FTC sued them on allegations that they were gouging patients who needed insulin to stay alive.
But by early Tuesday evening came word that the FTC’s general counsel was staying that suit, possibly because there aren’t enough commioners with undisputed standing to hear it.
“Today, the General Counsel of the FTC stayed the administrative adjudication of the Commission’s case against the three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) over the price of insulin,” Slaughter and Bedoya said in a joint statement. “He, not any sitting commissioner, took this action; there are no Commissioners available at the FTC to adjudicate this case as a result of the Trump Administration’s attempt to remove us. Sadly, this was an entirely foreseeable consequence of illegally attempting to fire the minority Commissioners.”
They added, “The American people deserve a fair and timely adjudication of the serious allegations in the FTC’s complaint. We strongly object to the pause in this matter. Here, justice delayed will be justice denied. It is hard to think of a matter that is more important.” 
During Monday’s roundtable, Utah pharmacist Sheldon Birch described other problems in the pharmaceutical space. He said pharmacies such as his have no choice about signing the contracts the big pharmacy middlemen put before them. Birch said the reimbursements he gets under those contracts make it hard to stay in business.
“We see a massive transfer of wealth from Main Street to Wall Street,” he said. “It’s a problem. I’m a capitalist. I own businesses. But we need to have some help so we can have a playing field that is fair… Help me keep my small business alive. Help keep the dollars and cents on America’s small-town main streets.”
Slaughter, who took a Democratic seat on the FTC during Trump’s first term, said the antitrust laws the agency is supposed to enforce are intended to stop unfair flows of cash from Main Street to Wall Street.
“The law does not contemplate that,” she said. “This isn’t what the law was designed to protect.”

Carmen Comsti of National Nurses United said harm caused by corporate concentration extends beyond pharmacy. She said the 2019 purchase of non-profit hospital Mission Health in Asheville, N.C., by for-profit HCA Healthcare harmed the residents of a rural region. 
HCA closed a cancer center, a wheelchair clinic, primary-care clinics, and it reduced charity care, geriatric services, security and hospital chaplains at the western North Carolina facility, Comsti said.
“It’s not just what health care systems are doing to get market control,” she said. “It’s what they’re doing to our communities with that power.”
Deb Keaveny, a Minnesota pharmacist, said it’s important for Trump to keep politics out of antitrust enforcement.
“We are deeply concerned about the administration’s recent decisions,” she said, “Americans need reassurance that the FTC can and will stop anticompetitive practices in the corporate monopolization of health care. This isn’t a partisan issue and the removals (of Bedoya and Slaughter) put ongoing studies, investigations and actions in jeopardy and weaken enforcement.”
Bedoya seemed eager to get back to a sole focus on his day job.
“My hope is that we can get back to normal and start pushing this work forward,” he said.

Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert) speaking on the House floor on his failed reparations amendment Tuesday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)The House granted preliminary approval Tuesday to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, putting Maryland a step closer to becoming one of the few states to study inequality faced by African descendants in the state.
But the House first had to beat back two amendments to Senate Bill 587, including one on school choice that sparked heated back-and-forth after its sponsor said Black children’s problems today are the result of the “modern Democrat plantation of public education.”
Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) offered the amendment that sought to provide school choice for students  enrolled in one-star schools, the lowest rating on the state Department of Education‘s five-star rating system in its annual report card for schools.
Under his proposal, the parent or guardian of a child in such a school could choose a public or nonpublic school to send the child, with state and local per pupil funding used to let the student attend the chosen school.
Fisher, who emphasized he grew up in Baltimore City, said that while some members of the city’s delegation were “laughing” at his proposal, the amendment made sense because the majority of children “stuck” in one-star schools are Black.
“That’s on you. That’s not from slavery. Instead, that’s from the modern Democrat plantation of public education where kids aren’t learning in one-star schools,” Fisher said on the floor. “You, the Democrat Party, have kept kids on the plantation of not learning. Laugh as you may. You own it because you’re in charge.”
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) gave a short history lesson in reponse, as well as a summary of the bill. She read a part of the bill that allows the commission to assess “any other topic deemed appropriate.”
  Health and Government Operations Chair Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Anne Arundel & Prince George’s) speaking on the House Floor. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
According to the bill, the commission would assess federal, state and local policies between 1877 and 1965, informally known as the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies.
“This bill is needed because of the history of slavery in Maryland and the role that our state that we live in played,” said Peña-Melnyk, chair of the Health and Government Operations Committee that reviewed and advanced the bill Friday.
After Fisher pleaded with his colleagues “to vote for your conscience” and accept the amendment, the House rejected his proposal 99-37.
The chamber also rejected an amendment from Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County), who sought to add individuals or ancestors who “were Union soldiers or otherwise fought to end slavery.”
“It would include those individuals into this conversation about reparations for the significant work that they did, frankly, to correct a wrong here in this county,” he said.
Peña-Melnyk said she received Nawrocki’s amendment “right now at this moment, which is no courtesy. Does not allow one to prepare adequately. If you come to HGO [the committee], I give you respect. I expect the same.”

As for the amendment, she said Black soldiers faced economic, housing and other forms of discrimination compared to white soldiers. She said Black soldiers faced discrimination when they returned home from war.
“The Black soldiers couldn’t get those loans. They could not start a business,” Peña-Melnyk said. “We’re talking about restricted covenants that did not apply to white people. It applied to Black people.”
The House voted 100-34 against Nawrocki’s amendment.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)This past decade or so, I have considered myself an increasingly engaged voter in Kansas. I work in education and have lived in this area for more than 20 years. My kids attended the surrounding public schools, and my family works and volunteers in this community.
What happens in Kansas matters to me.
With so much uncertainty in government lately, I’ve been paying close attention to local and state politics. After watching the disastrous town hall meeting held by Sen. Roger Marshall in distant Oakley, I decided to request forums from my state-level elected officials, Rep. Carl Turner and Sen. Kellie Warren. After all, they are voting on a lot of important matters that affect my family and my neighbors. Voter rights, school funding and policy, judicial matters. The list goes on.
I was curious: Would they even be open to a town hall meeting? Would they handle it differently than Marshall? Would they help ease voters’ minds or add to the discontent and uncertainty?
I began by emailing requests for town hall meetings to Turner and Warren, whose crew frequently canvassed for votes in my neighborhood during elections. I offered to help facilitate a town hall if they would agree to make an appearance — something I have no idea how to do but figured I would learn — if they said yes.
It’s been a little more than four weeks as I write this column, and I have yet to hear back about scheduling a town hall or meeting with either of them.
I have continued to send email requests at the start of every week. I have called their offices. A representative in Warren’s Topeka office advised me that she was “really busy with everything going on” but assured me my letter would be printed out and placed upon her desk for review. I’ve heard nothing.
Turner replied to one email regarding his stance on Senate Bill 4, which eliminates the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots. While he didn’t offer a town hall, he did offer to meet with me. Progress. Or so I believed. When I replied that I would like to meet, Turner did not respond to my email.
If I can’t connect with them, how do I know they are listening to any of their constituents?
Our elected officials, who were busy knocking on doors in October, making appearances and kissing babies all over town, are nowhere to be found now. I could not easily find updates from them in newsletters or social media posts, either. Even so, newsletters wouldn’t be enough. The lack of even an automated reply to a constituent week after week is inexcusable.
Their inaccessibility to Kansans is worrisome. They are voting on issues that affect Kansans and the neighborhoods they live in. We deserve more.
The area where I live in southern Johnson County has allowed Turner and Warren to become invisible. They live in our neighborhoods; their children may have attended schools in the community, or we run into them at a grocery store or at church. Some of us may be friends with them. But don’t give them a pass to not listen. They are our neighbors and promised to govern for us.
Our elected officials, especially those embedded in our neighborhoods, should make it a priority to connect with our community and let their constituents know that they care about what we have to say outside of an election year.
Kansans should demand more from leaders. I guess the problem lies in finding them first.

There’s no more fundamental task for a school than teaching kids to read.
But what about kids living in poverty? Don’t schools need more money, and more staff, to be able to get good results?
Well, yes and no. Poverty is certainly correlated to reading scores, and the best evidence suggests money helps boost a range of student outcomes.
But that doesn’t mean the best school district in the country is the most well-resourced or the one with the fanciest buildings or most prestigious alumni. In fact, based on how much students learn — which, in my opinion, is how schools should be evaluated — there’s perhaps no better district in the country than Steubenville, Ohio.

Last fall, I worked with The 74’s Art & Technology Director Eamonn Fitzmaurice to find districts where students had high reading scores despite serving large concentrations of low-income students. We highlighted Steubenville, a high-poverty district in Ohio’s Rust Belt, as a true outlier. (In a follow-up piece, we showed that Steubenville was also exceptional at teaching kids math.)

But I wanted to revisit the case of Steubenville after it was spotlighted recently on Emily Hanford’s award-winning “Sold a Story” podcast. Are its results just a one-time fluke? And if not — if the results are real — what can other districts learn from Steubenville’s success?
First, it’s quickly apparent that Steubenville is not a flash in the pan. A 2012 Hechinger Report story noted that its success traces back to the early 2000s.
It’s also incredibly consistent over time. I used the Zelma tool from the Education Data Center to look at its recent results. The graph below compares Steubenville’s third-grade reading proficiency rates (in blue) to the statewide average (in gray). As the graph shows, Steubenville consistently gets 95% to 99% of its third graders over the proficiency bar. In 2018, it had a bad year, and “only” 93% of third graders scored proficient. But the district did not suffer much of a drop-off in the wake of the pandemic, hitting 97% in spring 2022.

Steubenville’s results are also remarkably strong across student groups. Last year, for example, 100% of its Black students, 99% of its low-income students and 92% of its students with disabilities scored proficient in third grade reading.
How does Steubenville get such remarkable results? What can other districts learn from its success?
It’s not that the district has extra money or more staff. Steubenville spent $10,718 per student last year, which was about $1,500 less than the average Ohio district and well below many other districts in America. It also had slightly more students per teacher than other comparable districts.
Some things Steubenville does have are not easily replicable. As Robert Pondiscio pointed out in a recent column, the district can boast incredible continuity: It has been following the same reading program, called Success for All, for the last 25 years. Teacher turnover is low, and the same superintendent has been in place for a decade.
But Hanford found a few things that Steubenville did differently that other schools can learn from. Steubenville, for example, offers subsidized preschool beginning at age 3. And in those early years, teachers regularly remind students to speak in complete sentences as language practice for later, when those kids will start learning to read and write.
The district also deploys staff differently than most do. Every elementary teacher, even the phys ed instructor, leads a reading class. And during that reading block — which all students have at the same time — children are grouped with peers performing at the same level, regardless of age.
Steubenville kids are also practicing constantly, either as part of the whole class or in small groups, where kids work on their fluency skills by reading aloud to each other. That stands in contrast to schools that prefer to give kids silent reading or “Drop Everything and Read” time, which can be great for kids who already read well but wasteful or even harmful for children who aren’t ready for long blocks of independent free reading.
Now, it’s worth noting that Steubenville’s robust education results have not guaranteed kids a path to economic security. Despite its near-perfect early reading scores, strong middle and high school achievement and a 96% graduation rate, the district’s post-high school results are only slightly above statewide averages in terms of college-going and completion rates and the percentage of graduates who find “gainful employment.”
But those early adulthood outcomes are at least partly tied to the economic climate in a given community, and it’s hard to find fault with anything that the school district itself directly controls. Most districts would envy Steubenville’s impressive results.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Senate Tuesday passed a package of energy reform bills that would set in motion a variety of electricity generation projects  — from solar to nuclear to natural gas — start long-term energy-supply planning efforts and give ratepayers a slight rebate.
The goal, legislators say, is to eventually tamp down skyrocketing electric costs with a host of policy prescriptions — and also give residential ratepayers, on average, an $80 refund on their electric bills in the next fiscal year.
“What we know is that every dollar matters,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), “and so we are doing what we have immediately available of ratepayer money and returning it to ratepayers in the most efficient way that we can, while focusing on the longer term, complex problem of increasing generation, and making it cleaner.”
The bills backed by legislative leaders passed the chamber virtually untouched, but collectively garnered nearly three hours of debate. They now move to the House for consideration, with Monday’s end to the legislative session looming.
Ferguson said Tuesday that leaders in the two chambers are closely aligned on the bills.
“It’s hard conversations, because these are really complex topics, and I think that we’ve really gotten to a good spot of general agreement,” Ferguson said. “There are going to be changes here and there, things around multiyear rate plans. I think we’re going to be OK.”
General Assembly energy package a mixed bag for environmental groups

Four Republican senators voted in favor of the broadest bill of the bunch, the Next Generation Energy Act, which included the ratepayer reimbursement, “fast track” proceedings for new power generation facilities and an end to a controversial subsidy for trash incinerators that create energy.
Sen. Justin D. Ready (R-Carroll and Frederick), the chamber’s minority whip, said he’d be voting against the bill, in part because he felt it should have done more to repay ratepayers for what he called the state’s flawed renewable energy policy. He argued the bill should have included further incentives for natural gas power plants, calling the fuel “nature’s gift.”
But, speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, Ready said there were redeeming parts of the bill.
“My vote is going to be red. I think there could be some members of my caucus that vote green, and that’s a fine vote too,” Ready said.
Attracting significant debate Tuesday was a bill to create uniform standards for solar projects in Maryland, including requirements that they be fenced off, set back from nearby buildings and surrounded by trees and shrubs.
The bill came in response to concerns that Maryland’s patchwork of varying local regulations on solar were pushing solar developers away, said Sen. Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery), chairman of the Senate’s Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
“We’re retiring oil and coal plants, so we are in a bit of a pickle,” Feldman said. “If we let every local commissioner group or city council have veto authority about any energy project anywhere in the state we’re going to have even a bigger problem.”
Currently, the Maryland Public Service Commission has final say on all solar projects that generate 2 megawatts or more of electricity. In other words, the state commission, which regulates utilities, can overrule local authorities to approve a solar project in a community.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Feldman said the bill would do something “unprecedented” to limit the commission’s broad authority: It would limit solar generating stations to 5% of “priority preservation areas” in the state, which are lands capable of supporting agricultural or forestry operations.
Republican senators expressed concerns about preserving the character of rural areas and ensuring fields aren’t permanently lost to solar panels. In turn, they made several attempts to lower the 5% cap, but their efforts failed to win Democratic support.
“We’re talking about utility-scale solar that is eating up much of agricultural fields and lands in especially the Eastern Shore of Maryland,” said Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore), the minority leader.
An attempt by Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Middle Shore) to lower the cap to 2% failed, as did Hershey’s proposal to start the cap at 2% before later raising it to 5%  — so long as solar arrays were spread equally around the state.
“This is a very simple amendment. It’s reasonable … It just says it has to be done equally around the state,” Mautz said. “We just want to be treated fairly. That’s all we want.”
Republican senators also took issue with pieces of the broader energy bill proposed by leadership, the Next Generation Energy Act, although they generally agreed with the premise that the state needs more in-state energy supply to reduce consumer costs and the state’s reliance on large transmission lines.
When it came to light last year, a new power transmission line expected to cut through rural portions of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties drew considerable community pushback. The proposed Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project was necessitated in part by the retirement of Maryland coal-fired poewer plants Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, as well as an increase in energy demand, including from power-hungry data centers in Northern Virginia.
In one amendment, Maryland Republicans proposed sending more direct relief to residential ratepayers than the expected $80 in fiscal 2026.
The bill brought to the floor Tuesday would pull a one-time chunk from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities pay into when they fail to comply with a state law that requires them to pay for a certain amount of renewable energy.
Hershey’s attempt to make consumer payments permanent failed.
“We’re getting a lot of phone calls and emails. It’s not because somebody’s bill went up $40, but it went up multiple hundreds of dollars,” Hershey said.
Lawmakers’ touted electric bill refund would average $81 per household

Hershey also tried to add language limiting multiyear rate plans for utilities, which let power companies propose several years of rate increases in a row. The bill that reached the Senate floor Tuesday would prevent multiyear rate plans unless they show a benefit to ratepayers.
Hershey suggested eliminating the mutliyear plans altogether, arguing that the state should return to “traditional” year-by-year ratemaking. But Democrats disagreed, arguing that multiyear ratemaking could allow utilities to save customers money by planning ahead for costs.
“If they are able to use it in the right way, we want this tool to be on the table,” said Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s). “Now, what we are not going to allow is for them to then just use this as a piggy bank.”
Republicans also saw an opening to try and amend the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities to meet a minimum percentage of their electricity sales with renewable energy sources, for which they purchase credits from generators of approved renewable energy.
The bill removes trash incinerators, also known as waste-to-energy facilities, from the list. They were added to the list in 2011.
Hershey argued the Senate should lower the required renewable energy percentage by 15% — approximately the amount that incinerators contributed as of the most recent report. But Augustine disagreed, arguing that renewable energy projects coming online in the future would “fill this gap.”
“The committee made a policy decision that the state of Maryland no longer felt that waste-to-energy was an appropriate part of the renewable energy portfolio,” Augustine said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0010-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 04:58:59.359349

Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

State health plan ban gets inmate addition
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery’s Senate Bill 39 passed through a House committee on a party line vote with a new amendment.
The original version of the bill, which had already passed the committee, barred transgender state employees or their dependents from receiving care on the state health insurance plan. The version that passed the House Health Committee Tuesday also specifically prohibits people in state correctional institutions from getting gender care.
There are currently about five people who are incarcerated in Georgia who receive this care, according to Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson.
  Rep. Marvin Lim, right. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Norcross Democratic Rep. Marvin Lim argued that removing transgender health care from the plan would violate the law.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in February that discrimination lawsuits and other complaints involving transgender people had cost taxpayers at least $4.1 million since 2015, including $2.1 million to settle claims and another $2 million in legal costs. Those numbers include $365,000 paid out in a 2023 settlement in which the state agreed to provide coverage for gender-affirming care and not to restrict it again.
“We feel very strongly that it would be an unconstitutional impairment of contracts to undo those settlements, let alone just an unconstitutional move to say that this wouldn’t violate Title VII, that this wouldn’t violate the equal protection clause,” he said.
  Rep. Brent Cox. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lim was referring to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on an employee’s sex, which includes whether they are transgender, and the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment.
Dawsonville Republican Rep. Brent Cox, who is sponsoring the bill in the Senate, indicated that the law will be a message to the state judicial branch that the Legislature wants it to be legal to ban transgender health care.
“My belief is that it clears up for the judicial branch to be able to work within these guidelines on how they’re going to rule and move forward,” he said.
Lim said he was not convinced.
“It is not enough for us to say this is our policy,” he said. “This is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal statutory law on anti-discrimination. So we can pass whatever law we want at the state level and say ‘the attorney general can’t do this, the Department of Community Health can’t do this.’ But the argument has always been that this is violating higher law, the federal law, and specifically the U.S. Constitution.”
Democrats on the committee also argued the language in the bill could eliminate mental health treatments for transgender people, which Cox said was a misinterpretation.
The bill will need to pass through both chambers before Friday’s final deadline if it is to become law.
Standalone ban on jail treatment
Around the same time the House Health Committee passed SB 39, the House Public and Community Health took up Robertson’s Senate Bill 185, which also bans gender-affirming care for inmates but does not affect state employees.
  Sen. Randy Robertson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Robertson’s bill passed out of the committee with a voice vote, teeing it for a potential final vote by the Legislature’s April 4 adjournment. Speaking to a reporter in the hallway after the committee approved his bill, Robertson said he hadn’t had time to see the latest revision on SB 39, but he supports Tillery’s state health plan ban and would likely be happy if either bill passed.
Republican supporters make the case that taxpayer money should not go toward gender-affirming care in state prisons.
“I understand individuals get upset when I say this, but I do mean it with all compassion: elective surgeries cannot be a part of our cost in the Georgia Department of Corrections,” Robertson said.
Opponents of the bill counter that gender-affirming care encompasses more than surgeries, is far from elective and can be necessary for a person’s wellbeing. Several speakers, including two attorneys with civil rights organizations, argued Tuesday that the measure is unconstitutional.
“If adopted, Senate Bill 185 would impose blanket bans on the provision of gender-affirming care to incarcerated people with gender dysphoria, regardless of needs,” said Emily C. R. Early with the Center for Constitutional Rights. “These blanket bans have repeatedly been found unconstitutional because they show deliberate indifference to the needs of incarcerated people.”
“This Senate bill puts lives at risk, and in so doing, would bring constitutional challenges,” she added.
Robertson was dismissive of those potential challenges to the state.
“We have the five individuals who are seeking the care, and then we have the lawsuits, and if you look at that, one of the failures within our system right now is the fact we do not have a policy against it,” Robertson said.
  Rep. Michelle Au.. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Tuesday’s debate also veered into discussion about the origin of the slate of bills targeting transgender Georgians this year. There are at least five bills gaining traction, and lawmakers have spent hours deliberating on them and hearing public input on them, and they are spending the final days of the session trying to finalize them.
Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, said House Republican colleagues have told her that she should support Robertson’s bill because the issue of inmates receiving gender-affirming care is why former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential election last year.
A leading Senate Democrat representing an Atlanta district caused an uproar last month when she joined three other Democrats who voted for Robertson’s bill.
“That comment has been made to me several times, and I just have to put on the record that I really resent a subset of our patient population being used in this way for clearly political reasons, and I really wish that you would not put your voice behind this bill,” Au said to Robertson.
Robertson said politics wasn’t the motivation for him. But Rep. Scott Hilton, a Peachtree Corners Republican, acknowledged the influence of the 2024 election.
“Politics does inform policy as much as that politics reflect what our communities want,” Hilton said. “And I think if anything this last cycle, we learned that this was an 80/20 issue, not just in Georgia, but frankly America, and that folks were flabbergasted to learn that a small segment of our population opposed policies like this.”
But Bentley Hudgins, state director with the Human Rights Campaign, argued that exit polling showed that transgender issues ranked low on the list of voter priorities.
“We have seen time and time again in history where powerful people have used public opinion to excuse crimes against humanity,” Hudgins said.
“I do want to challenge that notion that just because, even if it were true that the majority of people think that this is a popular issue, it doesn’t give you the right to pass it.”

The 33-13 vote sets up a conference committee with the House, which has approved its own version of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act. The Senate also amended the House bill Tuesday to mirror its own version and now sends both bills to the lower chamber.
While it was largely expected, Tuesday’s party-line Senate vote was delayed for almost 25 minutes while senators debated an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to add language to the House bill that would prohibit transgender females from participating in women’s sports in school.
“This amendment is to simply ensure that there is a level playing field for girl’s sports at the high school level by allowing only biological girls to play on a high school interscholastic or intramural varsity or junior varsity team that is designated as a girls, female, or women’s team or sport,” said Sen.  Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll), the Senate minority whip and sponsor of the proposed amendment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE“We want to protect the crucial role that women’s sports have played in development of young women,” said Ready, who said his wife participated in track and field in high school and at Salisbury University, where they met.
Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s), the floor manager for the bill, said he supported the concept of Ready’s amendment but that “it’s not germane to this bill.”
But Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) supported the amendment, talking about her time as a tennis player in high school and at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. She also read a letter from a volleyball player at her alma mater, Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin.
“While the other team was warming up, my teammates and I immediately noticed the strength and speed with which the biological male hit the volleyball,” Carozza read. “It was apparent that the skills of the biological male surpassed anyone else on the court. My teammates and I were not only intimidated, but we feared for our safety.”
Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City and Baltimore County), the first openly gay African-American member of the Maryland General Assembly and still only one in the Senate, also read a letter from a high school student. But this one highlighted came from the only female player on a co-ed soccer team who said she was “bullied, ridiculed and harassed for six years.”

“If you want girls sports to be more fair, there are other ways to do it. But it’s my belief that the people who don’t want transgender women in sports and pass bills … should instead focus on providing more support for women in these other spaces,” Washington read, before voting against the amendment.
“In not allowing transgender girls to participate in women’s sports, we continue a long history of policing women’s bodies,” Washington said.
Even Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) offered a few words before he voted against the amendment.
“When I’ve had conversations with transgender young people who are trying to find themselves and live in a community, the pain and suffering that so many of them have felt, feeling out of place and not having a spot in this world is unbelievably painful,” he said. “So, when I think about how we should be educating kids, it should be about what is in the best interest of children.”
The Senate voted 27-17 to reject the amendment, before voting to make the House bill conform to the Senate version.
Local school officials have long asked for more flexibility in the implementation of the Blueprint, now in its third year, and with the state facing a $3 billion budget shortfall this year, many targeted the school reform plan as an area for savings. Gov. Wes Moore (D) in January proposed a bill that deferred the start of some programs in the Blueprint and would slow the pace of some budget planned budget increases.
The House approved its version of the Blueprint reform bill earlier this month, rejecting cuts in per pupil funding and eliminating a four-year pause on the implementation of teacher collaborative time, both elements in the governor’s plan. The House voted for a one-year pause in the start of collaborative time.
The Senate bill is more closely aligned with the governor’s bill on the per pupil funding and collaborative time provisions.
House members are expected to reject the Senate’s changes to the House bill, creating the need for a conference committee to work out compromise language between the two chambers. That agreement will need to come before Monday night, the closing day of the 2025 General Assembly session,",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-Justin-Ready-4-1-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 04:00:51.642733

Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.
Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

Despite outspending Ewing by hundreds of thousands of dollars, former State Sen. Mike McDonnell finished a distant third after angering key parts of both major political parties. 
The Nebraska Democratic Party censured the then-Democrat last year for casting the critical vote to pass new restrictions on abortion and transgender health care. He also angered the right by withholding his vote for shifting Nebraska to winner-take-all in presidential elections after joining the Nebraska Republican Party.
Contentious campaign
McDonnell, who ran for mayor as a Republican, has been highly critical of the incumbent GOP mayor, attempting as a longtime union leader to outflank her on the right. 
Community activist Jasmine Harris finished fourth after pledging to focus on public safety through investing more in community-based programs. Terry Brewer, the founding pastor of New Covenant Church of God in Christ in North Omaha, finished fifth in the primary election.

Much of the race discussed the city’s streetcar project, taxes, and housing costs.
Stothert is seeking a fourth term as the city’s top elected official, a record in the modern era. She has emphasized her record of results, including changes to make downtown Omaha more appealing and encouraging redeveloping parts of the city that had lagged. While the mayor’s race is nonpartisan, local parties have campaigned for central candidates. 
“Our campaign has been built around our record of progress, determination, and the successes we’ve had,” Stothert said after the first batch of election results. “That’s the positive message we will continue to deliver for the next six weeks.”
McDonnell heavily criticized Stothert during the campaign, emphasizing the streetcar, homelessness, spending and the poor quality of city streets. Stothert won anyway.
Stothert, Ewing lead unofficial results
As of the 10:25 p.m. results in Douglas County, she had 25,056 votes. Ewing had 21,623 votes. And McDonnell had 13,859 votes according to unofficial election results.
  Republican State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha talks about his bid for mayor with local reporters. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)
McDonnell conceded the race before 10 p.m., saying he was “proud” of his campaign because he was “listening to the people.”
Ewing has been the Douglas County treasurer for almost two decades and was a former member of the Omaha Police Department. He has campaigned to improve city infrastructure, public transit, development and create more jobs.
“We believed all along that we were going to be in the general election. We believe that citizens of this community appreciate good government,” Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner.
Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse had anticipated a voter turnout slightly above average for the local race. 
McDonnell made noise
McDonnell is known statewide for his stint in the Nebraska Legislature, where he opposed Republicans’ 11th-hour push for winner-take-all before the 2024 presidential election. He also helped Republicans pass the state’s stricter law banning abortion after 12 weeks of gestational age.  
He spent much of his campaign railing against the Omaha streetcar project favored by Stothert and downtown Omaha businesses, including Mutual of Omaha. Other candidates echoed McDonnell’s criticism of the $459 million project, but said it was too far along to stop without the city facing legal and financial risk.
Ewing told the Flatwater Free Press that the project needs to continue, but that city residents should have been able to vote on it.

The Nebraska Democratic Party got one of its two endorsed candidates through with Ewing. Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb, endorsed Stothert. The Douglas County Republican Party endorsed McDonnell.
Stothert and Ewing are likely to increase their leads Friday, when Kruse’s county election office will count about 7,000 outstanding early votes turned in on Election Day. Those typically follow the same pattern as the first round of counted early votes that Kruse released at 8 p.m. Tuesday, which showed Stothert leading, Ewing second and McDonnell third.
Harris said that the results weren’t what she had hoped for, but she would continue to prioritize the people of Omaha.
“I’ll continue to do the work in front of me, and I look forward to others joining in on how we can continue to build an Omaha that works for everyone, regardless if it’s an elected seat or not,” Harris told the Examiner. 
The general election is set for May 13.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Following a lengthy and contentious debate, the Legislature on Tuesday advanced an effort to weaken and add exceptions to the minimum wage increase Nebraska voters approved by ballot measure in 2022.
In a 32-17 vote, state legislators pushed onto the next stage of lawmaking an amended Legislative Bill 258 championed by businesswoman and State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.
At times, the debate got personal, with colleagues on the left pointing barbs at Raybould.

Raybould’s family owns B&R Stores, which owns Russ’s Market, Super Saver and more in the state. Her last day as company vice president was Monday, the same day debate began on her bill. She had filed a conflict of interest statement after introducing LB 258, her 2025 priority bill, earlier this year.
“When my colleagues want to beat up on me, please do, I can take it,” Raybould said during debate. “I am proud of my work and service to my community and my state over these years, and I will stand up for a balanced approach to creating good policy that keeps our Nebraska families safe, healthy and, most importantly, employed with benefits and competitive wages.”
The coalition behind the successful 2022 campaign said Raybould’s bill could lead to Nebraska wages falling behind increasing costs of living.
“We are very discouraged by the Nebraska Legislature, once again, standing in direct opposition to the will of the majority of Nebraska voters,” the Raise the Wage Nebraska coalition said in a statement.
‘I want the accountability’
Rough waters may be ahead, though, for the effort as 33 votes are needed to get the bill over the finish line. Freshman State Sen. Stan Clouse, the former Kearney mayor, voted to cease debate but against advancing the bill. Raybould would need his vote, or another, for her bill to pass. Amending voter-approved laws requires at least 33 votes.
Raybould said after the vote that she was not worried and already was working on a way to cinch the necessary support. She said she felt attacked and had never heard colleague State Sen. Danielle Conrad, a fellow Lincoln Democrat, “beat up anybody as badly as she said terrible things about me.”











I want the accountability. I want the record to show who you are.


– State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln



The current Legislature’s most veteran lawmaker, with 11 years in the post, Conrad said she stood up for the will of the voters and did not view young workers as “subhuman” subject to subminimum wages. 
Among Raybould’s proposed changes is the creation of a new and lesser minimum wage for youths ages 14 and 15. Federal law sets many restrictions on these youth workers, such as requiring non-hazardous or non-manufacturing jobs and prohibitions on duties the workers can perform.
“When’s it enough?” asked Conrad of voter support. Of 49 legislative districts, a majority of voters in 38 districts supported the ballot language Raybould’s bill would change. Raybould’s constituents were the fifth highest in support.
“I want the accountability,” Conrad said.  “I want the record to show who you are.”
Proposed changes
The ballot initiative voters handily approved in 2022 gradually increased the minimum wage by $1.50 a year until it reaches $15 an hour by Jan. 1, 2026. The minimum wage after that is to adjust annually based on the Consumer Price Index to account for cost of living increases.

Raybould’s amended LB 258 instead would:

Increase the minimum wage annually by up to 1.5%, beginning in January 2027, based on the Midwest CPI.


For youth workers ages 14 and 15, a $13.50 minimum wage would increase by 1.5% in January 2030 and every fifth year after. Emancipated minors are excluded. There is no such provision in state law currently.


Adjust the optional 90-day training wage for new workers ages 16, 17, 18 and 19 to $13.50 an hour through the end of 2026 and, starting in January 2027, the wage would increase by 1.5% each year. Emancipated minors are excluded. (Currently, an employer may pay a new employee younger than 20, and who is not a seasonal or migrant worker, a training wage of at least 75% of the federal minimum wage for 90 days from the date of hire, or $5.44.)

Those who opposed the changes argued that the Legislature should respect the nearly 6-to-4 vote for specific language for raising the minimum wage over time. They said carving out exceptions could hurt lower-income workers struggling to make ends meet.
Those who backed the Raybould proposal said that finessing ballot actions is within the Legislature’s purview and can help ensure laws are workable. They said the proposed changes protect small businesses and the jobs they provide.
‘Sad state of affairs’
The fiery debate that stretched over a couple of days revealed deep frustration amidst factions in the Legislature.
“This has been on the books, and there has not been any need to walk it back,” State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said of the minimum wage law. “There has not been any catastrophic effect.”










I will stand up for a balanced approach to creating good policy that keeps our Nebraska families safe, healthy and, most importantly, employed with benefits and competitive wages.


– State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln


State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha described the current year as his worst in the Legislature.
“We wonder why people don’t get out and vote,” he said. “We come in here and we work against them. That is sad. It’s a sad state of affairs for the Nebraska Legislature.”
Conrad said she has never seen morale as low as it has been this legislative session.
“The frustration,” she said, “is that you shouldn’t have to explain basic civics to adult state senators.”
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said the minimum wage initiative did not see any organized opposition in 2022 because, she said, those interests knew they’d find “stooges” in the Legislature to push their agenda.
She took aim at lawmakers for looking out for “personal business interests” and said voters did not vote to support a “second-tier wage” for certain workers. 
Said Hunt: “I have never seen such a blatant, bald-faced, self-serving, self-dealing, selfish, unethical example of self-dealing as this bill in the Legislature.”
Conrad, questioning Raybould’s transparency with constituents, asked if the lawmaker’s campaign materials pledged to change the will of voters and to “stick it to low-income working families.”
“If in fact that was part of your outreach in getting into this body, that’s a different story,” Conrad said.
Raybould was the lone Democrat to support the measure. Two Republicans, Clouse and State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, opposed it. 
‘You haven’t done your homework’
Raybould said Nebraska currently has the 18th highest minimum wage in the U.S., but the 10th lowest cost of living. She suggested that colleagues talk with small businesses, including local daycare centers, nonprofits, grocers or retailers who she said are “struggling” on “shoestring budgets.”
If they did, she said, they would realize there are impacts from raising minimum wages so quickly — increased prices, decreased hours for workers and small businesses shuttering. If they don’t, Raybould told them, “You haven’t done your homework.”
In a reference to comedian Groucho Marx, Raybould said: “Who are you going to believe: Me or your own eyes?”
“I ask you: Take a moment. Reach out to them,” Raybould said. “Reach out to your local grocer who might be the next person to create a food desert in your rural community.”

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City agreed, cautioning against job losses, particularly for low-skilled workers, and machines replacing workers.
“Businesses might invest in automation or technology to replace low-wage workers,” he said. “This could disproportionately affect workers in industries like retail or food service” or sectors with repetitive tasks that are easily automated.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who chairs the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee that advanced Raybould’s bill, said she wasn’t in favor of the bill when the youth wage would have applied to older teen workers. But limiting the new, lower wage to 14 or 15 year olds, who can only work certain hours around school or during certain hours of the day and are limited in work, got her support.
“If you’re not allowed by the federal government to do the full job, you should not get the full wage,” Kauth said.
Kauth said bumping up and aligning the training wage for 16-, 17-, 18- and 19-year-old workers with the state minimum wage, rather than the federal minimum wage, was also a “significant” and positive improvement.
Raybould said the new wage could incentivize businesses to hire young workers. Conrad countered that customers don’t care how old an employee is who puts a can on a shelf or the pepperoni on a pizza.
‘A better resolution’
Clouse, a key swing vote on the issue who regularly met with Raybould and Conrad during debate, and had on his desk a stack of research papers, including the ballot initiative wording, read to reporters the language that voters approved for annual increases in the “cost of living” for the minimum wage.
  State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney reads the voter initiative packet from 2022 that led to increases to the state’s minimum wage. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He said minimum wage can be a “job killer” for some workers who, as a “matter of economics,” might benefit while others might lose their jobs. He said a set annual increase could provide certainty but didn’t have any number in mind other than to say “it’s more than one and a half, I know that.”
“I think it’s right for those who voted for it, and I think it’s right for the business owners,” Clouse said. “It’s certainty, and I like certainty, and I like minimizing the risk.”
Clouse said he feels there is always a way to find compromise and reach a good decision. But he said calling people names or pointing fingers isn’t the way to do so. 
“Hopefully we get it worked out because this is no fun, everybody’s sitting through this stuff all day. It’s a waste of our time, but yet everybody’s wanting to do what’s right for their constituents, and I get that,” Clouse said. “That’s part of the process I’m not used to because that’s not how we do business in Kearney.”
‘The will of the people’
Clouse said he will not vote for “cloture” to end debate or to advance LB 258 unless the bill is amended first. The bill would face up to four hours of debate during the second of three rounds of debate.

Raybould filed an amendment Tuesday that would let the minimum wage increase faster than her most recent proposal’s 1.5% cap, a key point of contention for Clouse. But it would still include a flexible increase of between 0% and 2.5% each year, based on inflation. 
Raybould and others reminded colleagues that the Nebraska Constitution allows the Legislature to modify laws passed using ballot measures. 
Others, like State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, said that “just because you have power doesn’t mean you should exercise it,” saying Raybould sought to undermine voters.
“We’re not using it to undermine the will of the people,” Raybould said. “We’re doing it to review and reflect and make sure we make a clear balance and have a clear understanding of the unintended consequences and impacts it can have on businesses, on daycare centers, on paying for referees for our youth sports. All of these costs will be passed on.”



Raise the Wage Nebraska donations 
State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus on Tuesday criticized the Raise the Wage Nebraska campaign for getting the vast majority of its funds in 2021 and 2022 from out-of-state donors, most from groups in Washington D.C., that don’t disclose individual donors.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair echoed Moser and said curbing out-of-state donations should be a bipartisan effort.
According to the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission data through January 2023, roughly 79% of funds for the campaign came from Washington D.C., while 19% came in-state from Lincoln, Omaha or Lyons. The Lyons-based Center for Rural Affairs gave $20,000.
The largest in-state donor was Nebraska Appleseed, at $560,474.21.
D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund gave the campaign $2.49 million throughout 2022. The fund is managed by Arabella Advisors, which was founded by a former administration appointee of former President Bill Clinton. It oversees a hub of other left-leaning nonprofits that have received donations from billionaire George Soros in the past. It doesn’t disclose its donors.
Raise the Wage Nebraska also received $183,189.63 from The Fairness Project, a progressive labor-focused group that also helped the Nebraska campaigns to expand Medicaid (2018), curb predatory payday lending (2020) and secure a minimum level of paid sick leave (2024).
Rounding out the campaign’s top donors was the Service Employees International Union, which was established in 1921 and is based in Washington, D.C. The union has about 2 million members.
The campaign gave Nebraskans for Paid Sick Leave in August 2023 a donation of $15,454.87. The Legislature last week voted 34-14 to advance a bill to add new carveouts to the paid sick leave before it takes effect Oct. 1. The first voter-approved minimum wage increase from the 2022 effort took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha was and continues to be the campaign’s treasurer.

Ward was convicted of capital murder in 1990 and sentenced to death in the 1989 strangulation killing of 18-year-old convenience store clerk Rebecca Doss.
Ward was among eight inmates who were scheduled to be executed in 2017 as the state worked to impose the death penalty before drugs used in the lethal injection process expired. The state Supreme Court granted a stay for Ward after his attorneys argued his longstanding mental illness prevented him from understanding his punishment.
Ultimately, the state executed four of the eight.
Twenty-four inmates remain on death row in Arkansas.

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner Incumbent Jill Underly, who had the backing of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, won a second term as state superintendent on Tuesday, defeating education consultant and Republican-backed candidate Brittany Kinser. 
The Associated Press called the race at 10:05 p.m. with Underly leading by more than 5 points and more than 80% of the votes counted.  
The state superintendent, a technically nonpartisan position, is responsible for providing guidance for the state’s 421 public school districts, leading the Department of Public Instruction (DPI)  — an agency responsible for administering state and federal funds, licensing teachers and developing educational curriculum and state assessments — and also holds a position on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. 
Throughout the campaign, Underly faced criticism from her opponent, Republicans and others for her recent approval of changes to state testing standards and poor communication with school districts. 
Underly defended her decisions throughout the campaign, however, and said that she has served as “the No. 1 advocate for public education” in her first term and would continue to do so if reelected. Prior to being elected to the top DPI position, Underly worked as assistant director in DPI. She also previously served as a principal and superintendent of the Pecatonica Area School District and taught in public schools in Indiana.
Underly received endorsement from Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers’ union, and AFT-Wisconsin. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin contributed over $850,000 to her campaign. While Underly had the backing of the state Democratic party, Democrat Gov. Tony Evers refused to endorse in the race. 
Underly leaned on her advocacy for public schools while making the argument for her reelection. She introduced a budget request for the state that would have invested over $4 billion in public education, saying that it’s what schools deserved. Republicans and Evers both said it was too large. 
At Underly’s Election Night party, Sen. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said Underly’s victory was a vindication of her first term in office.
“She’s had to make do with some really tough choices, and she’s done a great job for kids and for teachers,” Hesselbein said.
Underly hit her opponent for her lobbying and support for Wisconsin’s school choice programs, for lacking a teacher’s license and for lacking experience in the state’s public school system. She also expressed her opposition to the growth of the state’s school choice programs. She said it is not sustainable for the state to fund two school systems and would oppose dedicating more money to the programs.

The amendment was approved by 25 points. The Associated Press called the election less than 40 minutes after the polls closed. 
The Republican-authored referendum does not change the law that was already on the books in the state which requires that voters show an approved ID to register to vote and receive a ballot. Republican legislators said the amendment was necessary to protect the statute from being overturned by the state Supreme Court. In recent years, Republicans in the Legislature have increasingly turned to the constitutional amendment process to shape state law without needing the signature of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. 
Democrats had accused Republicans of including the referendum on the ballot in this election as an effort to boost conservative turnout in the state Supreme Court election. 
Wisconsin’s voter ID law has been on the books for more than a decade. During debate over the law, Republican lawmakers discussed its potential to help the party win elections by suppressing the vote of minority and college-aged people who tend to vote for Democrats. 
Democrats and voting rights groups said the law amounted to a “poll tax.” A 2017 study found that the law kept 17,000 people from the polls in the 2016 election. 
Since its passage, a number of court decisions have adjusted the law, leading the state to ease restrictions and costs for obtaining a photo ID — particularly for people who can’t afford a high cost or don’t have proper documents such as a birth certificate. 
Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country have increasingly focused on photo ID requirements for voting since conspiracy theories about election administration emerged following President Donald Trump’s false claims that he was robbed of victory because of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential campaign.
While the law doesn’t change, the approved language of the amendment gives the Legislature the authority to determine what types of ID qualify as valid for voting purposes. Currently, approved IDs include Wisconsin driver’s licenses and state IDs, U.S. passports, military IDs and certain student IDs.

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk. 
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points. 
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk. 
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion and join labor unions. 
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel. 
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total in counties across the state. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County. 
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday. 
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding. 
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other. 
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps. 
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk. 
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1000002135-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-01 23:01:58.657626

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — As a trial opened Tuesday for a woman accused of stealing $1.8 million intended for children under South Dakota’s care, the defense alleged that the state shares the blame for crimes that are too old to punish, while the prosecution described a long-running and calculated scheme.
Lonna Carroll, a 68-year-old retiree, is charged with two felony counts of grand theft for crimes she allegedly committed from 2010 to 2023 while working as an administrative assistant for the Division of Child Protection Services in the state Department of Social Services. She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for the first count, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the second count.
The case is part of a rash of criminal allegations against state employees that state Attorney General Marty Jackley has filed since last year, leading not only to criminal prosecutions but also to a series of administrative and legislative reforms adopted in response.
Carroll has been held at the Hughes County Jail since her arrest last summer, because she has not posted bail of $50,000. Her trial is expected to last several days this week at the Hughes County Courthouse.
The alleged crimes
Once a child is placed in state custody, Child Protection Services employees can make financial requests on the child’s behalf for items such as school supplies, clothing or a bed. The funds are deposited into a bank account for the child. 
Jackley alleged during opening statements that Carroll made requests, approved the requests, deposited checks at American Bank and Trust in Pierre into children’s accounts, and later withdrew the deposited amounts in cash. 
Carroll allegedly did that 215 times, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73 over the course of 13 years. 
“It wasn’t by mistake,” Jackley said. 
Investigators allegedly discovered a storage unit in Pierre associated with Carroll that had “boxes full of receipts” for expensive clothing.
Carroll was making $21.09 an hour when she retired in March 2023 prior to the discovery of her alleged crimes, and she had since moved to Algona, Iowa. The South Dakota Department of Social Services has an annual budget of $1.8 billion and more than 1,500 full-time positions.
The case begins
Carroll spent much of the first day of trial hunched over with her arms crossed, staring at the floor. The day was consumed mostly by jury selection and opening statements.
Questions to potential jurors from Carroll’s court-appointed attorney, Timothy Whalen, largely centered on concerns about preconceived notions of the case. He also asked potential jurors what a statute of limitations means and whether they accept the notion.
Former state employee pleads not guilty in $1.8 million theft case

Whalen’s opening statement included a claim that the crimes are too old to prosecute, though he did not delve into specifics.  
“They’re time-barred,” Whalen said. 
Whalen also said the state needs to take responsibility for its own negligence. He said prosecutors should be required to demonstrate the state was conducting some level of due diligence to prevent the theft from occurring.
“Who was watching the door?” Whalen asked jurors. 
Jackley asked potential jurors if they had negative ideas about the state or the criminal justice system. He also asked how they would feel if someone stole a car with the keys left in it. 
Jackley told jurors during his opening statement that they will hear audio of Carroll admitting she stole the money during a Division of Criminal Investigation interview. 
“You’ll see the whole paper trail process,” Jackley said. 
Testimony kicks off
Jackley kicked off the state’s case with testimony from Carrie Watts, the state employee who discovered the financial discrepancies that ultimately led to the investigation and criminal charges. 
A court document says Watts discovered the irregularities in 2023 while comparing spreadsheet balances with actual account balances.
“One of the discrepancies was that certain accounts showed significant sums of funds in them on a spreadsheet, but the funds were not actually in the account,” the court document says. 
Watts, who left the department last year, described her actions as routine. 
“It’s like balancing a checkbook,” Watts said during her testimony. 
She said Carroll managed the bank accounts in question.
“They all had Lonna’s name on them,” Watts said. 
The defense attempted to use Watts’ testimony as evidence of the state’s negligence, asking why a simple audit took so long to be conducted.

Later, Tonia Bogue, who worked with Carroll, took the stand. She said Child Protection Services has three tiers of approval for payment requests, and Carroll was authorized for all three levels. 
Bogue said she had “no idea” how Carroll attained that level of authority.
When asked by Whalen who is tasked with ensuring someone requesting a payment is not the same person approving the payment, Bogue said “I don’t know.” 
Two employees with American Bank and Trust also took the stand. The prosecution presented an exhibit showing a nearly $20,000 check was deposited by Carroll into a child’s account on Oct. 6, 2020, and withdrawn by her as cash the next day.
Carroll allegedly kept individual withdrawals under $10,000 to avoid being flagged for fraud. 
Aimee Parsons, a bank employee, said she was familiar with Carroll depositing and cashing the checks, but she never reported the behavior. 
“Because she was authorized to conduct those transactions,” Parsons said.



Other cases of alleged state employee crimes
The Carroll case is one of five that Jackley has filed since last year accusing state employees of crimes.
The run of allegations started in August, when Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light. 
In October, Jackley announced charges against two more former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Danielle Degenstein, 51, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Degenstein is charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly concealing her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified in court documents as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. Degenstein’s case is scheduled for trial in June.
In December, Renee Strong, 55, of Springfield, was charged with felonies for allegedly submitting falsified reports of food-serve health inspections while working for the state Department of Public Safety. She’s scheduled for a motions hearing next week.
In January, Amalia Escalante Barrientos, 28, of Brookings, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for using a grocery voucher intended for clients of the Department of Social Services. She was sentenced to pay a $400 fine, $96.50 in court costs and $449.98 in restitution. She’ll avoid serving 180 days in jail if she complies with the sentence.
In response to the run of alleged crimes, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Lawmakers also passed legislation strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record was previously held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act.
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Head Start child care providers in Wisconsin and five other Midwestern states were stunned Tuesday to learn that the federal agency’s Chicago regional office was closed and their administrators were placed on leave — throwing new uncertainty into the operation of the 60-year-old child care and early education program.
“The Regional Office is a critical link to maintaining program services and safety for children and families,” said Jenny Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, in a statement distributed to news organizations Tuesday afternoon.
The surprise shutdown of the federal agency’s Chicago office — and four others across the country — left Head Start program directors uncertain about where to turn, Mauer said.
“We have received calls throughout the day from panicked Head Start programs worried about impacts to approving their current grants, fiscal issues, and applications to make their programs more responsive to their local communities,” Mauer said.
The regional offices are part of the Office of Head Start in the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
In an interview, Mauer said there had been no official word to Head Start providers about the Chicago office closing. Some program leaders learned of the closing from private contacts with people in the office. 
“We have not seen official information come out” to local Head Start directors, who operate on the federal grants that fund the program, Mayer said. “It’s just really alarming. For an agency that is about serving families, I don’t understand how this can be.”
The National Head Start Association issued a press release Tuesday expressing “deep concern” about the regional office closings. 
“In order to avoid disrupting services for children and families, we urge the administration to reconsider these actions until a plan has been created and shared widely,” the association stated.
Katie Hamm, the deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development at HHS during the Biden administration, posted on LinkedIn shortly before 12 noon Tuesday that she had learned of reduction-in-force (RIF) notices to employees in the Administration for Children and Families earlier in the day. 
RIF notices appear to have gone to all employees of the Office of Head Start and the Office of Child Care in five regional offices, Hamm wrote, in Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle in addition to Chicago. 
“Staff are on paid leave effective immediately and no longer have access to their files,” Hamm wrote. “There does not appear to be a transition plan so that Head Start grantees, States, and Tribes are assigned to a new office. For Head Start, it is unclear who will administer grants going forward.”
Hamm left HHS at the end of the Biden administration in January, according to her LinkedIn profile. 
Mauer said regional office employees “are our key partners and colleagues,” and their departure has left Head Start operators “incredibly saddened and deeply concerned.” 
Regional employees work with providers “to ensure the safety and quality of services and to meet the mission of providing care for the most vulnerable families in the country,” Mauer said. 
The regional offices provide grant oversight, distribute funds, monitor Head Start programs and advise centers on complying with regulations, including for child safety, she said. They also provide training and technical assistance for local Head Start programs.
“The Regional Office is a critical link to maintaining program services and safety for children and families,” Mauer said. “These cuts will have a direct impact on programs, children, and families.”
In addition to Wisconsin, the Chicago regional office oversees programs in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. 
Head Start supervises about 284 grants across the six states in programs that  enroll about 115,000 children, according to Mauer. There are 39 Head Start providers in Wisconsin enrolling about 16,000 children and employing about 4,000 staff.
The federal government created Head Start in the mid-1960s to provide early education for children living in low-income households. Head Start operators report that the vast majority of the families they serve rely on the program to provide child care so they can hold jobs.
The regional office closings came two months after a sudden halt in Head Start funding. Head Start operators get a federal reimbursement after they incur expenses, and program directors have been accustomed to being able to submit their expenses and receive reimbursement payments through an online portal.
Over about two weeks in late January and early February, program leaders in Wisconsin and across the country reported that they were unable to log into the system or post their payment requests. The glitches persisted for some programs for several days, but were ultimately resolved by Feb. 10.
Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday that so far, there have not been new payment delays. But there has also been no communication with Head Start operators about what happens now with the unexpected regional office closings, she said.
“No plan for who will provide support has been shared, and the still-existing regional offices are already understaffed,” Mauer said. “I’m very nervous to see what happens. With no transition plan this will be a disaster.”
In her statement, Mauer said the regional office closing was “another example of the Federal Administration’s continuing assault on Head Start” following the earlier funding freeze and stalled reimbursements.
She said closing regional offices was undermining the program’s ability to function.
“We call on Congress to immediately investigate this blatant effort to hamper Head Start’s ability to provide services,” Mauer stated, “and to hold the Administration accountable for their actions.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday put the kibosh on Democratic lawmakers’ plans to use billions of dollars from a proposed wealth tax to balance the state budget.
Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, also said he could not sign budgets passed in the two chambers in recent days because they each rely too much on taxes. 
“We cannot adopt an all-cuts budget,” he said. “We cannot adopt a budget with anywhere near the level of taxes in the House and Senate plans.”
He called on lawmakers to “immediately move budget discussions in a different direction.”
Ferguson remained skeptical about the proposal to tax financial investments held by wealthy individuals, saying it would be “difficult to implement, and most importantly, for purposes of adopting a sustainable budget, will face an immediate challenge in court.”
He said at a news conference he would not sign any spending plan dependent on substantial revenues from a new and untested tax that faced the “real possibility of being overturned.”
But he left the door slightly ajar for House and Senate Democrats to pencil in the wealth tax if they count on no more than $100 million a year to see if it can withstand a legal challenge and be upheld “in the court of public opinion.”
“I am open to a conversation,” he said. “I want to be very clear that I’ve not committed to that.”
The governor on Tuesday also reiterated his view that it will take a mix of spending cuts and new revenue to overcome a projected shortfall of $16 billion over the next four fiscal years.
Majority Democrats in the House and Senate have made the wealth tax a cornerstone of their respective revenue packages to balance the next state budget.
It is counted on for $2.4 billion in the two-year House budget approved Tuesday and $ $4.2 billion in the one passed by the Senate on Saturday. The sums are different because they are not identical approaches.
The architect of the wealth tax in the Senate said the governor’s comments show there is “common ground” on which to negotiate in the final month of the session.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, a vice chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said she was “very glad” Ferguson acknowledged Washington needs to reform its “upside-down tax code” that hits those with lower incomes hardest. And she said she revised language in her bill to address specific concerns he raised.
“This whole thing is very dynamic. I think he opened the door for ongoing conversations and set the bar for progressive revenue,” she said. “We’ve got three-and-a-half more weeks to get it done.”
Mechanics of the tax
The House wealth tax proposal would levy a tax of $8 on every $1,000 of assessed value of certain financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. The tax would only apply to the value of these assets that is above $50 million. 
There would be exemptions for pensions, retirement accounts, and education savings accounts. About 4,300 people would pay the tax, generating about $2 billion per year, beginning in fiscal year 2027, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Those dollars would be dedicated to the Education Legacy Trust Account, where they could be used for public schools and early learning programs.
Senate Democrats want to set the tax rate at $10. They contend the same number of people would pay, but the amount generated would be $4 billion a year. That’s because they tax the full value of the targeted assets if a person has more than $50 million of them.
In other words, if you have $51 million of these assets, Senate Democrats would apply the new tax on all of it, while the House would only tax the $1 million.
‘The wrong move’
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said he appreciated Ferguson’s “candor” and “thoughtfulness” concerning taxes and spending.
“I think his priorities are spot on,” he said. “I think his priorities line up much closer to the budget Republicans proposed.”
Opponents of the wealth tax applauded the governor’s comments. They have argued such a tax would cause wealthy individuals to flee Washington and that it would hurt investment in businesses in the state. They also contend it would tax out-of-state wealth in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
“A wealth tax is the wrong move for Washington — both legally and economically — and Ferguson’s remarks are a clear sign that Olympia is finally beginning to hear the concerns of families, small businesses, and job creators across the state,” reads a statement issued jointly by the Association of Washington Business, Bellevue Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and Washington Roundtable.
In an interview, Steve Mullin, president of the Washington Roundtable, said the Legislature “should not assume any revenues from a wealth tax for the foreseeable future.” 
If such a new levy is enacted, the organization would “do what we can” to facilitate challenges in state and federal courts, Mullin said.
Ferguson mum on other taxes
Washington’s next budget cycle begins July 1 and runs through June 30, 2027.
The much-discussed multibillion-dollar shortfall represents the amount needed to maintain current levels of service, pay for new and expanded programs authorized in previous budgets and cover the cost of new collective bargaining agreements with employee unions.
In addition to a wealth tax, the revenue package crafted by Senate Democrats would increase the cap on annual growth in property tax collections, impose a new tax on the payrolls of large companies and axe several tax breaks. Altogether it could gross $21 billion over four years.
House Democrats are focused on the wealth tax plus measures to remove the 1% cap on annual growth in property tax collections. They also want to add a surcharge on large corporations and financial institutions. Their package would generate roughly $15 billion.
On Tuesday, Ferguson said he has a topline number in mind for how much he’d tolerate raising from new taxes, but he declined to share it. He also didn’t say much about the other Democrat-backed tax ideas, which Republicans have blasted since the start of session.
“This is enormous, shocking, surreal, stunning — whatever word you want to pick — amount of taxes proposed,” Braun said. 
Ferguson’s silence, he said, does mean any or all of those taxes could be pursued. But he didn’t fault the governor as he thinks he is “doing the right thing he needs to do to be successful” in negotiations with budget writers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 22:02:04.406924

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Visitors to the state Capitol in Juneau will have to go through a metal detector under a policy adopted on Monday. 
The Capitol visitor screening policy was approved in a 9-4 vote by the Legislative Council, a body made up of members from both the House and Senate that sets the rules for the Capitol complex. 
Lawmakers did not publicly discuss or debate the policy change. Before the vote, they met in a session closed to the public for more than an hour and a half for a security briefing and to discuss the policy proposal.
The council declined to require that people in the building have ID badges, which was part of the original proposal. 
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak and the council’s vice chair, supported the change. He described his reasoning in a Senate majority caucus news conference on Tuesday. 
“The idea, really, is … to make sure people aren’t entering with weapons — with guns, with knives and that sort of thing,” he said. “You know, some folks have said, ‘Well, let’s wait until there’s an incident, where someone gets hurt, and then we will install it.’ I think that’s not wise at all.”
Stevens cited a comment by Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, that hundreds of people undergo screenings at the annual Alaska Federation of Natives convention with little wait time. 
Stevens also noted that metal detectors are used in the Dimond Courthouse across the street from the Capitol. 
“You have them [at] every airport you enter into, so it’s not as if people are unaware of how they work,” he said. 
People who already have an electronic keycard to enter the building will not be affected by the policy. Stevens said the security staff who will operate the metal detectors say 20 seconds is the most time it would take to move through the devices.
Stevens said several times recently, people who work in the Capitol have told him they had concern or fear regarding visitors who don’t have a reason to be in the building.
Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau and the council chair, also voted for the change. She wrote in a newsletter to constituents on Tuesday that no legislators were happy to make the change, but waiting for a tragedy to occur was unacceptable.
“Legislative Council did not arrive at this decision lightly. For decades, we in Alaska have taken pride in the citizenry’s open access to the Legislature,” Hannon wrote. “However, and very unfortunately, in recent years our country has changed in ways that have led to increased risk of violence in our public institutions. The tragic, unchecked level of shootings in U.S. schools is in itself horrifying. The January 6th, 2020, attack on the nation’s Capitol is another dispiriting example.” 
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, opposed the change. He is not currently on the council but served as its vice chair last year and said the idea has been under discussion for at least four years. He said Capitol security staff had brought up how only a few state capitols do not require screening. He said the staff’s job is to keep the building secure, and they were doing their job by bringing the screening idea to legislators.
McCabe said the discussions prompted him and other Matanuska-Susitna Borough legislators to ask constituents about the idea while they were campaigning. 
“They’re already very angry that the Capitol is still down here in Juneau, where they can’t come visit and they can’t really get to us, so they just saw closing the Capitol with magnetometers and badges … they saw that as just another step in isolating legislators from the public,” McCabe said. “And they believe, as do I frankly, that the Capitol building is the people’s building.”
McCabe predicted that the next step would be to require badges.
“I just feel we should leave it open. We have a really able security team and, frankly, Alaskans are just not that militant, that they would storm the Capitol or come into the Capitol and create an issue,” he said. 
The council members who voted for the policy change were chair Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau; Stevens; House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham; Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage; Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage; Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage; Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage; Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka; and Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak.
Voting against requiring the screenings were Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks; Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau; Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage; and Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole.
The council also voted 8-5 to award a contract for up to $35,000 to University Protection Service LP to provide the screening services. The only difference in the council members’ votes was that of Stedman, who voted against the contract. He said he generally opposed adding the metal detectors, noting that visitors already have to make an effort to go to Juneau. But he said he decided to vote for the policy after the council made it less onerous by removing the ID badge requirement.

The overall budget grows by about 1.5% even though the general fund budget — the portion funded by direct state taxes — fell by more than $400 million. The bill now heads to a House-Senate conference committee. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Senate Tuesday voted to approve the two-bill budget package that includes the overall spending plan and a second proposal that includes $1.6 billion in taxes.
The 33-14 vote on the overall $67 billion plan fell mostly along party lines. Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) joined the 13 Senate Republicans in opposition.
The bill that includes some budget cuts and the tax package drew more votes from Democrats. The package of budget bills now heads to a conference committee with the House to work out differences before the last day of the legislative session Monday.
Senate Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said the bills address projected structural deficits for fiscal 2026 and 2027 without requiring massive cuts to priorities, including education.
Despite the projections that included a $3 billion structural gap this year, Guzzone said he “was not worried about our situation in the grand sense because I always knew in my back pocket we had the ability to get rid of that structural deficit in seconds. But why would we? Why would we destroy that? We didn’t. We didn’t with this budget. We took tough stances.”
Not making the “heavy-handed” cuts he said some Republicans wanted was a sign that “we still have hope that we can accomplish those great goals that we established, because we decided that every child deserves a world-class education…. We balanced this budget this year, and we still kept sort of the hope of what would be the future.”
Even so, Republicans who had voted for eight budgets under Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and the first two proposed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) said they could not vote for the spending plan this year.
Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Lower Shore) said “the Senate version is much better than the House version, and I think that has to be acknowledged. The willingness to take a different look at the budget from the Senate versus the House is a good thing. It’s a good thing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t go far enough.”
Republicans also voted against the companion bill that includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes, even though they were able to get Democrats to agree Monday to earmark a new $5 per tire fee for highway projects.
Five Democrats joined all 13 Republicans to vote no on the companion bill: James and Anne Arundel County Sens. Dawn Gile and Shaneka Henson, Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Montgomery and Howard) and Sen. Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County).
Both bills, which were amended by the Senate, will head to a conference committee Wednesday with the House.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)After more than two hours of debate, an Arkansas Senate committee advanced a proposal on Tuesday to abolish the Arkansas State Library and its board, which disburses state funding to local public libraries.
Senate Bill 536 would transfer the agency’s and board’s powers, authorities, funds, contracts and employees to the Arkansas Department of Education. The State Library is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently.
The bill would delete all mentions of the State Library from existing state statute and make “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger” a condition for public libraries to receive state funds from the education department.
“My entire library, all 30,000 books, would fit inside this room,” Calhoun County Library Director Allie Gosselink said, speaking against SB 536 before the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs in the Arkansas Capitol’s Old Supreme Court room.
“I need a definition for ‘access,’ or I can’t let anyone that’s under 16… inside my door,” Gosselink continued.
SB 536 defines “age-inappropriate material” as “books, media, or any other material accessible at a public library containing images or explicit and detailed descriptions” of sexual acts, sexual contact and human genitalia.
The location and availability of books based on “appropriateness” for minors was the thrust of Act 372 of 2023. The law would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials.
A federal judge temporarily and later permanently blocked portions of Act 372; Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling in January.

New bill would dissolve Arkansas State Library and its board, set new library funding criteria


Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, sponsored Act 372 and is the primary sponsor of SB 536.
Protecting minors from “age-inappropriate material” in libraries and detaching from the American Library Association were the two requests Sullivan said he gave the State Library Board last month as conditions of its survival. The board voted against two proposals with those stated goals from Republican ex-senator Jason Rapert, who has called for the board’s abolition.
Sullivan subsequently doubled down on his existing promise to dissolve the board. He introduced a bill in February to abolish both the State Library Board and the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS, but he said he reached an agreement with the latter in March that led him to decide not to dissolve the commission.
On Tuesday, Sullivan told the State Agencies committee that his requests to the State Library Board should not have been difficult to fulfill and that SB 536 would ensure the state’s “oversight” of entities that receive public funds.
  Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)
“When people say ‘Book Ban Dan’ is taking away their library or killing their library, they chose that path,” Sullivan said.
SB 536 would require libraries to submit annual reports to the Department of Education that include “an assurance of compliance with the applicable laws of the state, rules promulgated by the department, and the policies of the public library.”
For example, Sullivan said, libraries should not espouse diversity, equity and inclusion policies or allow transgender people to use bathrooms that do not match their gender assigned at birth. Sullivan has sponsored or supported laws to these ends this year and in 2023.
Four library directors, including Gosselink, and Arkansas State Library grants manager Debbie Hall spoke against SB 536. No members of the public spoke for the bill.
 ‘Semantics’

If the education department determines a library no longer qualifies for state funding, the library would be allowed to appeal the decision as long as it can prove “the determination was made in error” or “the determination was correct but remedial actions have been taken by the public library to bring the public library into compliance,” according to SB 536.
The appeal process would not be sufficient if the law goes into effect July 1 in accordance with its emergency clause, said Misty Hawkins, regional director of the Arkansas River Valley Regional Library System, which has seven branches in Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Yell counties. The library system would have to rewrite its interlocal agreements between the four counties to account for the new code and repealed code in SB 536, which is not possible to complete in only three months, Hawkins said.
“As a director, I am now doing more [to] ensure my libraries are in compliance in order to get the same amount of funding,” which is $188,000 from the state, Hawkins said.
She also said SB 536 does not specify how librarians must determine whether a book is appropriate for a 16-year-old but not for a 15-year-old. All five people who spoke against the bill said libraries already organize books on shelves in an age-appropriate manner in accordance with existing standards, and State Library Board members have made similar statements.

After rejecting the two proposals put forth by Sullivan and Rapert last month, the State Library Board passed a motion to create “non-binding policies to protect children” while honoring First Amendment freedoms and libraries’ material selection policies.
Sullivan said this was not enough to deter him from dissolving the board, partly because the majority of members still opposed removing references to the American Library Association from board documents.
On Tuesday, Sullivan repeated his criticism of a former ALA president for publicly calling herself a Marxist and the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights for stating that access to libraries should not be restricted based on a person’s age.
The ALA presidency is “a ceremonial job” that does not directly influence the policies of the nonprofit trade association that advocates for libraries and helps them secure grant funding, said John McGraw, executive director of the Faulkner-Van Buren Regional Library.
Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, said the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights rubs him the wrong way because it asserts “you can’t protect a 3-year-old” from inappropriate content.
Gosselink called Clark’s statement “semantics.”
“Not a single person sitting behind me will tell you that you do not need to protect a 3-year-old from certain things that are in our libraries,” she said. “That is the parents’ job. We can’t make a whole library acceptable for a 3-year-old.”










Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best. This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.


– Clare Graham, Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System director


McGraw said, not for the first time, that his library system doesn’t have a mechanism to lock away books that might be appropriate for adults but inappropriate for small children.
A bill advanced later on Tuesday that would require Arkansas public school libraries serving K-5 students to segregate “non-age-appropriate sexual content” in “a locked compartment within a designated area.” House Bill 1646 passed the House with 75 votes for it and 14 against it, mostly along party lines, and will next go to the Senate Education Committee.
SB 536 includes a limited exception to the proposed restrictions on “age-inappropriate materials.” Sex education materials would be accessible to minors between 12 and 15 years old, and those under 12 would not be able to access such materials if their parents or guardians have forbidden their access in writing.
Six of the eight Senate State Agencies committee members, including Sullivan, voted to pass SB 536. Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, voted against it. The committee’s sole Democrat, Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock, was absent during the vote.
 Hours of operation and federal ‘chaos’

SB 536 would also require libraries to maintain a specific minimum hours of operation depending on the populations of the areas they serve. For example, a library in a community of less than 10,000 people would have to be open 1,480 hours per year in order to receive state funding, and a library that serves 10,000 to 19,000 people would have to be open 1,730 hours per year.
The library directors who spoke against the bill said this would disproportionately threaten rural libraries’ funding. McGraw called the provision an “unfunded mandate” and said it would apply unevenly to the branches he supervises in Conway and in rural areas.

Gosselink said the payroll and utility costs to meet the hours requirement at the Calhoun County Library’s main branch in Hampton would cost more than the state funding she currently receives, which is $7,100 per year.
“It’s my entire discretionary budget for programming, for books, for computers, for anything I might do that’s above and beyond opening the doors and turning on the lights,” she said.
Sullivan said county governments and taxpayers would be required to put in extra effort to make up for any library funding that might be lost, but he also said he doubted that libraries are at risk of losing funding in the first place.
McGraw challenged this statement and mentioned that the entire staff of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services was put on administrative leave for 90 days Monday. Earlier in March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to gut the federal agency that provides grant funding to libraries nationwide.
The Arkansas State Library distributes IMLS funds to Arkansas libraries. These funds support summer reading programs, interlibrary loan programs, resources for blind and print-disabled library patrons and state document depositories, Arkansas Library Association president and Garland County Library director Adam Webb told the Advocate.
McGraw called SB 536 “an unnecessary introduction of chaos” into the already uncertain landscape of library funding, and he said the bill does not include any metrics for measuring improvements within libraries that meet all of the bill’s state funding requirements.
The fourth library director to speak against the bill was Clare Graham, who oversees the five-county Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System.
“This bill imposes a one-size-fits-all approach that stifles creativity and flexibility,” Graham said. “Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best. This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.”
The full Senate will consider SB 536 Wednesday. The bill’s emergency clause requires two-thirds of the chamber’s support, or 24 votes.

However, it doesn’t appear that it was the funding levels that drew the ire of nearly every single senator on Tuesday.

Instead, Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian, said so-called budget intent language included in sections nine and 10 on page four of the bill could violate a provision of the Idaho Constitution. The Idaho Constitution prohibits the Idaho Legislature from “Authorizing the laying out, opening, altering, maintaining, working on, or vacating roads, highways, streets, alleys, town plats, parks, cemeteries, or any public grounds not owned by the state.”
Page four of Senate Bill 1205 calls for setting aside “at least $8,000,000 shall be used towards the construction of a road widening project and bridge reconstruction for congestion mitigation on a residential mobility arterial that connects a State Highway to a U.S. Highway.”
“Page four of the bill, section nine and 10, are the specific areas where I think we have some concerns and potentially are in violation of Article Three, Section 19 of our Constitution,” Den Hartog said. 
Boise Dev has reported that the intent language could force the Ada County Highway District, or ACHD, to spend millions on specific projects. 
Den Hartog expressed similar concerns Tuesday.
“There is only one highway district and one road in one county that is being directed to spend a certain amount of money in this budget, and for that reason, I cannot support this,” Den Hartog said. 
It was not immediately clear what happens next with the Idaho Transportation Department budget, but the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee may elect to redo the budget before the Idaho Legislature adjourns its annual legislative session for the year.

The bill [&#8230;]","A bill targeting the swine farm moratorium in the Buffalo River watershed made it out of committee Tuesday. (Photo courtesy of National Park Service)A bill that could strip away an environmental permit moratorium intended to protect the water quality of the Buffalo River watershed passed out of a Senate committee Tuesday.
Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, passed the Senate Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee on a voice vote, with audible dissent.
The bill has gone through multiple revisions since it was introduced and has sparked strong opposition from environmental groups in the state that said removing the permit moratorium could again allow another facility like C&H Hog Farms to open up shop in the watershed, endangering the Buffalo National River. The state of Arkansas spent $6.2 million to buy the farm and shut it down in 2019, after years of efforts led by groups such as the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance.
Unlike previous versions of the bill, the latest version would not immediately strike the moratorium that is currently in place, but would instead require the Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality and the Department of Agriculture to go through the rulemaking process again for the rules that contain the moratorium if the bill goes into law. The effective date for the bill, if passed, is Jan. 1, 2026, and agencies would have 90 days from that date to get approval for a moratorium.
The rules containing the moratorium would then go back before the Arkansas Legislative Council or the Joint Budget Committee after agencies approve them through their usual rulemaking processes. The council, according to Johnson, would be granted greater leeway to reject the moratorium once it goes before them under his bill.
Moratoriums would expire four years after their effective date under the bill, requiring agencies to resubmit them for consideration and requiring legislative council approval every four years.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the governor would not support legislation that did not protect the river.
“Governor Sanders appreciates Senator Johnson’s leadership and dedication to Arkansas agriculture, but she is opposed to legislation that does not protect the Buffalo National River,” Dubke wrote in an emailed statement. 
Dubke did not say whether Sanders would sign the bill in its current form if it makes it through both chambers of the Legislature.
Multiple people spoke against the bill before the committee, urging lawmakers to protect “the jewel” of the state of Arkansas. 
Little Rock resident Richard Johnson said the moratorium needed to remain in place, citing pollution hazards posed by swine CAFOs, or concentrated animal feed operations.
“They tend to pollute way beyond their footprint,” Johnson said.
Mark Lambert, who represented Arkansas Farm Bureau, expressed support for the bill, saying that it was a “right-to-farm” issue. The bill wouldn’t take away any protections for the watershed — an assertion opponents of the bill pushed back against.
Committee members questioned why moratoriums would receive a “different threshold” for making it past the legislative council compared to other rules. Johnson said it was to return oversight to elected officials, and described the Buffalo River watershed moratorium, which has been in place for 10 years, as a slippery slope that could lead to other moratoriums. 
“This is oversight of executive branch departments,” Johnson said. “The moratorium is something that’s an outlier also, in my opinion as an agricultural producer, because that’s not allowing an agricultural producer to even apply for a permit. … This is telling a producer that he can’t even attempt to use his property in the way he wants to, and this can be expanded beyond just CAFOs.”
The only other watershed-based moratorium is for Lake Maumelle, a primary source of drinking water for the Central Arkansas region.
Johnson said everyone agrees that people don’t want CAFOs in the Buffalo River watershed and he didn’t think a producer would put one there in the first place.
However, there is a long history of swine farms within the watershed beyond C&H Hog Farms — something the DEQ said explicitly in its response to the Farm Bureau’s comments on changes to Rule 6 last year that would have made the moratorium permanent.
“The potential impacts of swine farms, including farms large enough to be considered CAFOs, on the Buffalo River have been an ongoing concern in Arkansas, and the Division (or its predecessors) have taken action to mitigate the impacts of existing farms in that watershed,” the division wrote last year. 
“In 1992, APC&EC Regulation 5 was adopted to address how liquid waste from swine farms should be handled. Also in 1992, the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (the Division’s predecessor) issued an administrative notice regarding its intent not to issue permits in the Buffalo River Watershed. Following … that notice, Arkansas participated in the Buffalo River Swine Waste Demonstration Project, which was initiated in 1995, to improve swine manure management in the Buffalo River watershed.”
Beth Ardapple, a Newton County farmer, called out a “false narrative” that farmers were opposed to a moratorium when she spoke against the bill. She said the Buffalo River has served as an affordable vacation spot for Arkansans for decades and that it needed to be protected. 
“I have great respect for my CAFO friends, people who own CAFOs. They love the land as I do. It’s simply that the science doesn’t support having the CAFO in the Buffalo River watershed,” Ardapple said.
Marti Olesen, the vice president of the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, said her business on the river would not survive if a CAFO returned to the area and polluted the river. 
“There is no other Buffalo River in Arkansas; it’s a national treasure,” Olesen said.
John Ray, a self-described environmentalist, said that one was not against farming if they supported protecting the state’s natural resources. Fishing and hunting businesses in the area were supportive of a permanent moratorium, he said, and tourism on the Buffalo River supports hundreds of jobs for concessioners, lodges and others who cater to those who enjoy the river each year. 
“These things are not going to change every four years, and there is no slippery slope when it comes to these kinds of large CAFO moratoriums,” Ray said. “This moratorium in the Buffalo River has been in place for over ten years; there hasn’t been an avalanche of moratoriums on hog CAFOs in other areas of the state.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Canoe-on-Buffalo-Fall-NPS-1024x662.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 22:02:04.406924

The reports circulated on social media claiming that there would be “more than 5,000 ICE agents patrolling the areas” in the two cities, as voters went to the polls to cast ballots in the April 1 election for candidates running for  Wisconsin Supreme Court, state superintendent, and referendum questions focusing on voter ID. 
Anxieties about ICE activities have been heightened under the Trump Administration. Recent weeks have seen videos showing plain-clothes, masked ICE agents detaining people on the street. Some of the detainees had been arrested after participating in activist activities, such as protests calling for an end to the war in Gaza. Fears of ICE raids have increased  in Milwaukee and Madison, as in other cities. 
Spokespersons for Milwaukee and Madison city government told Wisconsin Examiner that they have not heard any reports, complaints, or notifications about ICE agents at polling places. A spokesperson for the ICE office in Milwaukee said, “due to our operational tempo and the increased interest in our agency, we are not able to research and respond to rumors or specifics of routine daily operations for ICE.”
Meanwhile, turnout in Milwaukee has been so high that local news outlets are reporting that polling sites across the city have run out of ballots. The city’s Election’s Commission is arranging for fresh ballots to be sent to polling stations. In Tuesday’s election Republican-backed Supreme Court candidate and former Wisconsin attorney general Brad Schimel is facing off  against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who has the backing of state Democrats. In the  state superintendent’s race, incumbent Jill Underly is facing challenger Brittany y Kinser. Wisconsinites will also get to decide whether the state’s constitution should be amended to codify a voter ID requirement.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Those accused of working together to steal from retailers in Rhode Island could face felony charges under legislation under consideration in the state Senate.
The bill sponsored by Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, would impose up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 if two or more people are found guilty — the same punishment given to a repeat offender who has taken over $100 worth of merchandise. The bill would take effect upon its passage.
This is the second straight year Raptakis has filed a proposal to crack down on retail crime. Opponents argue it would disproportionately impact low-income youth. But Raptakis told the Senate Judiciary Committee that shoplifting will only continue to grow if it’s treated as a petty crime.
Under existing law, first-time offenders are charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at least $50 — or two times the full retail value of the merchandise that was reportedly stolen, whichever is greater.
“You see them all the time — individuals run into a store and steal probably tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes,” Raptakis said. “Hopefully we can do something to toughen our statutes to send a strong message against organized shoplifting.”
Should the General Assembly move forward on the bill, Rhode Island would join a growing number of states, including Vermont, that have tried to crack down on rising retail theft. Major retailers have also taken measures to curb shoplifting, often by locking up merchandise.
“Even Mucinex, a cough syrup, is locked up,” Raptakis said.

Stricter penalties cannot come soon enough for Nick Fede Jr., director of the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative. He told the committee that package stores are frequent targets for shoplifters, leading to fewer expensive beverages on display.
“There’s a romance to what we do,” he said. “People want to pick the bottle up, they want to feel it.”
While store owners are used to petty theft, Fede told lawmakers that groups of shoplifters only target items with high resale value.
“This is not unique to any specific geographic area of our state,” Fede said. “It’s happening everywhere.”
It’s especially been true for Providence and Warwick, both of which are home to malls. Providence Police reported 365 reported shoplifting offenses in 2024, representing a 52% increase from the year prior.
A 2023 report from the Warwick Police Department, the most recent available, notes 388 cases of shoplifting — representing an 8% increase from the prior year.
“Organized retail theft is a true concern of ours and exists at a pretty steady rate,” Warwick Police Chief Bradford Connor said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
But the bill has sparked serious warnings from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island and the state’s Office of the Public Defender.
ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown called Raptakis’ bill “a rather draconian penalty.”
“Shoplifting some item from a local store shouldn’t lead to such an excessive, such an incredibly harsh, prison sentence,” he said in an interview.
Megan F. Jackson, legislative liaison for the public defender’s office, wrote to the committee that the bill takes “an overtly harsh approach” and that the language is unclear on how such a law would actually be applied.
“The law would undoubtedly have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities already overrepresented in the criminal justice system, especially given that shoplifting is often driven by poverty,” Jackson wrote. “At best, it is counterproductive; at worst, it could be unconstitutional.”
Raptakis’ bill was held by committee for further study, as is common practice when legislation is first considered. Companion legislation has not been filed in the House.

Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’ ” Booker said.

Jonathan [&#8230;]","Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, presents Senate Bill 307 to the Arkansas Senate on March 5, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday rejected a $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. 
The bill’s failure marked the latest hurdle in constructing a prison in the rural western Arkansas county, which supporters, including the governor, have said is needed to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. 
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, a Searcy Republican and lead sponsor of Senate Bill 354, assured his colleagues they would be involved throughout the process because the executive branch will have to submit funding requests for different phases of construction that will require approval from the Arkansas Legislative Council before money can be spent.
Work is underway on an accountability plan with the Department of Corrections to ensure lawmakers are “tracking, monitoring and understanding the process and the progress of the prison construction,” Dismang said. 
“I understand that the members want to be engaged in this process as it moves it forward regardless of what happens with this appropriation, and you’re going to have the ability to do that,” he said.  
The Franklin County prison has been controversial since state and local officials and community members said they were blindsided when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in late October announced the state’s $2.95 million purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the project. In the months since, elected officials and local residents have continued to speak out against the prison. 
Officials last month issued a preliminary cost estimate of $825 million. The Legislature previously set aside $330 million for the proposed penitentiary, adding to another $75 million that had been set aside during former Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s administration.
Arkansas lawmakers advance $750 million appropriation bill for prison construction

Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, spoke in favor of SB 354 Tuesday. From the Senate floor, he recounted the story of Shawna Cash, who was arrested and released multiple times, including in Washington County where he said she was released in May 2021 because there was no room. 
Former Washington County Prosecutor Matt Durrett told the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette that COVID-19 pandemic precautions explained Cash’s release because it was common to release more inmates than usual to reduce populations and the risk of transmitting the virus. 
Cash was accused of striking and killing a Pea Ridge police officer Kevin Apple with her vehicle in June 2021. A jury convicted Cash of capital murder and sentenced her to life in prison without parole last year.
“There’s many Shawna Cashes in every one of our districts right now,” Hester said. “They should be in prison, but there is no room…we’ve got to have room, and I am begging you to not have something horrible happen in your district when we could have made a difference today.”
Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, who said he supports expanding prison capacity, spoke against the bill Tuesday, echoing his concerns from last month’s Joint Budget Committee meeting that there isn’t a large enough available workforce to support a large prison in that part of the state. 
When the governor began pushing for a prison after taking office in 2023, Payton said, there was “a pretty good dustup” between Sanders and the corrections board, whose members said they could not safely expand bed capacity because of a lack of staff.
“I understand it’s an appropriation and it’s not funding, but it’s a bad business decision,” Payton said. “And I’m not going to be responsible a year or two years from now when we spend three-quarters of a billion dollars, we’ve got the most beautiful, up-to-date, modern facility, we came in under budget and nobody to work there.”
Dismang said there are “other pieces to this puzzle,” specifically noting the governor’s overhaul of the state employee pay plan, which the Senate advanced Tuesday, “contemplates significant increases in pay for those working in our prison system.”
The argument did not sway Payton, who voted against SB 354 along with fellow Republicans Ron Caldwell, Jimmy Hickey, Ricky Hill, Bryan King, Clint Penzo, Terry Rice and Gary Stubblefield, and Democrats Greg Leding and Clarke Tucker. 
The bill garnered 19 votes in support, but failed because appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the Senate. Dismang could bring the bill back for consideration because there is no limit to how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill. There is a deadline for the end of the legislative session, however, which lawmakers anticipate will be April 16.

Randy Fine (Photo via Florida House of Representatives website)Republicans are celebrating in Florida and Washington, D.C., tonight, after two more of their ranks are going to Congress to pad the Republicans’ narrow lead over Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In the Congressional District 6 race in Northeast Florida, former state Sen. Randy Fine from Brevard County has defeated Democrat Josh Weil, an Orlando school teacher. Some polls showed Weil running competitively in the district, which went for Republican Mike Waltz over his Democratic opponent by 37 points in November.
With 95% of the votes counted, Fine led Weil with 56.5% to 44.5%.
In the District 1 race in Florida’s Panhandle, former Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has defeated gun safety activist Democrat Gay Valimont, 56.1% to 42.8%. That was with 89% of the votes cast in the district.
Florida’s 6th District encompasses Flagler, Lake, Marion, Putnam, St. Johns, and Volusia counties. Neither Fine nor Weil live in the district.
Waltz served there for the past six years. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis represented the area from 2012-2018.
Undoubtedly, Trump’s endorsement benefitted Fine, although DeSantis said earlier on Tuesday that the president got “bad advice” to endorse him.
“I think the Republican will win, but he will underperform because a lot of Republicans aren’t going to be willing to go out and vote for him,” DeSantis told conservative talk-show host Dana Loesch.
“I mean, you had him on your show, he was fighting for an amnesty bill in the Florida Legislature, he was attacking me for wanting strong immigration legislation. And so when voters see that, it’s like, you know what? Why would I want to vote for you if you’re just going to stab us in the back?”
The two had been close allies until the fall of 2023, when Fine blamed the governor for his handling of Jewish concerns following the Hamas attack on Israel and came out to endorse Trump for president.
Although most Democrats knew it would be a miracle to upset a Republican in the district, the huge fundraising advantage that Weil enjoyed (approximately $10 million for Weil to $2 million for Fine) had given them hopes that they could substantially reduce the margin of defeat.

“As Ronald Reagan said, ‘there you go again,’’ said Florida political strategist Barry Edwards. “This is another example of the Democrats overpromising and underdelivering, which is going to have an immediate effect of disillusioning the many donors and volunteers who helped on these races that thought that they were competitive, but they weren’t. And shame on the Democratic leadership, because they knew better.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin made a trip to District 6 over the weekend on behalf of the Weil campaign.
Weil released a statement shortly after the polls closed.
“The numbers didn’t add up in our favor today,” he said. “We shouldn’t be disappointed however, this race was closer than anyone ever imagined. In a district won by Mike Walz by 32 points, we closed that gap by a historic margin. An incredible gain. This progress is because of our grassroots supporters across the country and the voters in this district – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents — who believe in a brighter and kinder future. This result is also a warning sign to Donald Trump, Randy Fine, and the unelected oligarchs taking apart the government. Should they continue to steal people’s hard-earned money and benefits like Social Security and Medicare, defund education, focus more on culture wars than lowering costs: the backlash is only beginning.”
Florida’s 1st District sits in the far Northwestern Florida, encompassing  Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and parts of Walton County. Valimont raised $6.3 million from Jan. 9 through March 12, compared to Patronis, who raised $1.1 million.
Patronis had been considering a run for governor before Trump came out and endorsed him almost immediately after the seat became vacant following Trump’s selecting Matt Gaetz to leave the district to serve as his attorney general. (Gaetz ended up withdrawing from consideration for the position).
Patronis won the Republican primary election for CD-1 in late January, defeating nine opponents.
“That’s just an example of Donald Trump being more strategic than people give him credit for,” Edwards said, noting that Trump endorsed Patronis immediately after the District 1 seat became vacant.
“He wanted to have the field cleared for Byron Donalds, so he calls up Jimmy Patronis, who had told people he wasn’t going to run for Congress, and he endorses him. Four months later, Patronis is the congressman, which opens up the CFO seat for his buddy Joe Gruters and the governor’s seat for Byron Donalds.”
Gruters, a Sarasota-based state Senator, has already announced his candidacy for chief financial officer in 2026 and has been endorsed by Trump for that seat. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis isn’t expected to announce a successor to Patronis for the CFO spot until sometime after the Florida legislative session ends in May. He is not expected to name Gruters, who endorsed Trump over DeSantis for president in 2023.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Patronis-and-Fine-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-01 20:59:07.381262

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)A bipartisan bill would restructure the vacancy committee process to replace members of the Colorado Legislature based on when a vacancy occurs, such as when a member resigns.
House Bill 25-1315 was introduced on Monday, about three months into a lawmaking session that has seen a handful of vacancy committee appointments. It would have vacancy-appointed lawmakers run for their seat in either a regularly-scheduled general election or odd-year special election.
“Vacancies in the General Assembly are an issue I heard about as I traveled the state as the Minority Leader. The people want to preserve the vacancy committee process while also having the opportunity to vote for their legislators. This bill will do both,” House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement.
It is sponsored by Pugliese, Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, and Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican.
The bill would set the following guidelines for vacancy committees:

If a lawmaker resigns before July 31 in an even year, a committee would appoint a replacement and that person would need to run for the seat that November.
If a lawmaker resigns on or after July 31 in an even year, a committee would appoint a replacement and they would run for the seat in the next year’s November vacancy election.
If a lawmaker resigns before July 31 in an odd year, a committee would appoint a replacement and there would be a vacancy election that November.
If a lawmaker resigns on or after July 31 in an odd year, a committee would pick a replacement and that person would need to run for the seat in the next general election.

The effect of the change would be that appointed lawmakers serve one legislative session, which runs from January to May, until they need to run for reelection, either in a regular election or a vacancy election as created by the bill.
The new odd-year vacancy elections would take place alongside the statewide elections for ballot issues, local candidates and other items. Unaffiliated voters and voters from the same political party as the lawmaker who resigned in the legislative district would be able to participate in the new new odd-year vacancy elections.
Six lawmakers already appointed this year
Candidates could make the ballot for that election by collecting 200 signatures of voters from their party or by getting the support of at least 30% of the district’s vacancy committee.
Vacancy committees are currently composed of party central committee members, precinct leaders and state lawmakers who live in the district, as well as other highly involved party members. That means committees are typically made up of a few dozen people, but they can be much smaller. The bill would extend committee membership to county commissioners of the same party who live in the district.
The bill would also require vacancy committees to be livestreamed for the public. It also imposes campaign finance requirements for vacancy candidates.
Six lawmakers have been appointed via vacancy committee this year: Republican Sen. John Carson, Democratic Sen. Matt Ball, Democratic Sen. Iman Jodeh, Democratic Rep. Jamie Jackson and Democratic Sen. Katie Wallace. That high volume of appointments — two of which came when lawmakers resigned immediately after winning reelections — led to calls for process reform.
“For the past few years, voters have grown increasingly alarmed with our vacancy laws for important elected government offices,” Kirkmeyer said in a statement. “A handful of political insiders should not determine who sits in a state legislative seat for years at a time without voters being able to express their will. I’m pleased to be part of a bipartisan coalition that brings impactful reform to this process.”
A separate resolution in the Legislature also targets vacancy reform. House Concurrent Resolution 25-1002, also introduced Monday, would ask voters to amend the state constitution so that appointed lawmakers could not run as an incumbent in the election following their appointment. Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, ran a similar resolution last year and is sponsoring it again this year alongside Rep. Larry Don Suckla, a Cortez Republican, and Sen. Marc Snyder, a Manitou Springs Democrat.

SB 110, sponsored by Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer, would limit the number of trucks that can be pulled over to five at roadside weigh stations. Previously, there was no limit, which caused long lines of trucks on the sides of highways and caused truckers to lose work hours.
“If you’re taking a day off being in court, and then they may put it off then when it gets there. So we’ve got a win-win. We just didn’t get the axle weight,” Williams said after the bill’s passage.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill passed 32-0 after senators removed a provision that would have increased weight limits for log truck drivers for each axle over concerns about damage to road infrastructure. Williams said that was a deal he accepted as early as Tuesday morning but that he’d try to address weight limits in the future.
The amendment, proposed by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, would try to ease delays experienced by truck drivers, particularly those hauling logs, pointing to the possible economic impact of these delays.
“If you’re hung up on the side of the road for an hour, two hours, three hours, depending on how many trucks are backed up, well, you’ve lost money that day,” Chambliss said.
The bill also provides an appeals process for truck drivers who receive overweight citations based on portable scale measurements, aimed at addressing the potential of inaccurate portable scale readings.
While the bill aims to address efficiency and economic concerns, Williams said that weight limit issues, particularly concerning the hauling of 40-foot logs, require further attention. He said that logs cause more weights to be distributed unevenly between axles, causing drivers to haul fewer logs to comply with Alabama law.
“40-foot logs – that rear axle is going to get overloaded when you’ve got logs sticking all the way out there … if you’re hauling them legally, you’re hauling half a load of logs,” Williams said.
He said that weight limits were relaxed during the COVID pandemic, and he was not aware of any data that indicated roads were damaged during that time.
“That’s what I’d like to have back,” he said.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Chief of Police T.J. Bill said there had been ground, air and water searches using drones and dogs, and images from over 300 reservation surveillance cameras have been reviewed for clues.
Beson, a member of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, was last seen in the vicinity of Indian Village Road and Chequamegon Forest Trail in Lac du Flambeau.
She was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt.
Beson is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and leg.
Beson’s family reported her missing on March 23, six days after she was last seen.
“Finding her has been the number one priority of the LDF Police Department,” Bill in a statement. “We have conducted extensive ground searches on foot, even in severe weather conditions. Our officers have even come in on their days off to search for her. The dedicated members of Newbold Search and Rescue have once again come to our aid and have assisted us by searching with their specially trained canines.The dogs have shown interest and appeared to pick up Melissa’s scent in the area of her last known sighting.”
The LDF Police Department has used two high-quality drones to search a portion of the Bear River’s open water and plans to use an underwater drone to dive under ice.
“Although we are expending monumental efforts in searching the area in which Mellisa was last seen, we are in no way ignoring the possibility that she may be elsewhere,” said Bill. “Our officers are working non-stop, during every shift, to follow up on every lead and tip that we receive. We have combed through countless hours of surveillance footage, have interviewed dozens of people, and have reached out to law enforcement agencies in various areas of the State of Wisconsin, who have assisted us by contacting persons with possible information and even conducting searches of residences in their jurisdictions.”
Bill told the Examiner that the LDF Police Department has reviewed surveillance footage from over 300 cameras monitored around the reservation.
“So nothing’s been revealed on them, on the surveillance of the cameras, where she was last seen,” he said. Where Beson was last seen is “in more of a desolate area,” he added, “so we don’t have cameras that go out that far.”
He also noted that the ground searches using dogs had been hampered by recent weather, including snow.
“We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to LDF Emergency Management, LDF Tribal Roads Department, LDF Economic Support Department, Newbold Search and Rescue, the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department, and Vilas County Dispatch for their vital assistance to our investigative and search efforts,” he said.
He added, “We would also like to thank everyone in the community who has provided assistance to our Department and been supportive to Melisa’s family during this difficult time.”

Strom Thurmond's record for longest filibuster on Tuesday after speaking for over 24 hours and 18 minutes.  (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)This story originally appeared on New Jersey Monitor.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, the Senate’s minority leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.

“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause from his fellow Democrats.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

That will be part of a resolution the Utah State Board of Education is scheduled to discuss, and perhaps adopt, on Thursday.
Five Republican board members signed on to back a proposed resolution to remove DEI from Utah schools — Christina Boggess of Taylorsville, Cole Kelley of Vineyard, Joann Brinton of St. George, Rod Hall of Syracuse, and Emily Green of Cedar City — supporting a draft containing Trump Administration orders and a lot of Soviet Union terminology. 
“The Utah State Board of Education directs its employees and subsequent staff, instructional and administrative personnel to immediately disband any and all ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Practices;’” the proposal reads. “Moreover, the agency shall immediately disband and rescind all associated documents, training, programs, curriculum and policies.”

The state school board still doesn’t have an official statement on the resolution since the board hasn’t discussed it yet, a communications person for the board said, and Boggess, who is coordinating the effort, didn’t reply to a request for comment on Tuesday. 
The move stirred concerns from Utahns who oppose more DEI regulation in the state’s education system. Especially, since there’s already a Utah law in place that tightly restricts deploying DEI programs. 
When HB261 became law in the summer of 2024, all public institutions in Utah banned programs that “promote differential treatment” and may exclude some based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion or gender identity. 
As anti-DEI law takes effect, students and staffers share ‘great sense of loss’

“Of all of the anti-DEI things I’ve read in politics and in policy, this is the most far reaching and the most frightening,” Sarah Reale, one of two Democrats among the 15 state school board members, said on Tuesday. 
Citing the recent implementation of that anti-DEI policy, Reale questioned the necessity of such a resolution when Utah schools have spent the last year making substantial cuts to diversity programs and are already in compliance with new federal orders prohibiting DEI.
“We have tons of work to do — helping students’ math scores improve, helping find ways to provide teachers with professional development opportunities, finding ways to support parents in the schools.” Reale said. “So to spend time on something that, to me, is blatantly just inciting fear, and that doesn’t help our teachers or students in their learning environment (…) is embarrassing. The resolution is embarrassing.”
Utah State Board of Education resolutions aren’t binding, they are just approved statements that express the opinion of the board’s majority. However, the draft resolution cites a Utah Constitution provision that gives the board control and supervision powers over public schools and programs designated by the Legislature. 
However, Reale said, whether or not the resolution is enforceable isn’t the main issue. 
“It’s the principle, it’s the tone, it’s the message that it sends that’s hurtful and scary,” she said. Approving these kinds of resolutions, “feels very Big Brother, very big government,” which, she added, isn’t the role of the state school board. 
Soviet terms in Utah schools?
The resolution explains how a series of words and programs used in the Soviet Union may relate to DEI efforts —  “коренизация (korenizatsiya), which maps to ‘inclusion,’ and разнообразие (raznoobrazsiya), which means ‘diversity,’ in the sense meant by Lenin who described it as ‘diversity in form to arrive at unity in content.’ DEI at its core is 1920s Soviet Union policy for using ethnic minorities to advance the installation of Communism,” the five board members wrote in the resolution.
The authors also criticized the terms “identity politics” and “inclusion,” which they define as “programs, processes or implemented ideas that emphasize including, affirming and protecting counter-hegemonic perspectives at the expense of universal and objective truth.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Those correlations, Reale said, are false analogies.
“You cannot say that words in different languages mean the same thing and cross over with the same definition in English,” she said. “It feels very McCarthyism. It screams Red Scare. It’s frightening language.”
The resolution also has DEI as a synonym of Critical Race Theory, an academic discipline examining racial disparities in the country, which has existed for decades but became a hot culture war debate during Trump’s first term.
“DEI is not equal to CRT,” Reale said. “CRT is not found in any of our schools. We have looked and reviewed for anything that could be even a glimmer of CRT taught in our schools in Utah. They don’t exist.

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A federal judge declared an Arkansas law requiring age verification to create new social media accounts unconstitutional late Monday and permanently blocked the law.
The law, Act 689 of 2023, was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. It required social media platforms to verify the age of all account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas said in Monday’s ruling that Act 689 “would violate the First Amendment rights of Arkansans” because it is a “content-based restriction on speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.” The law also would violate the due process rights of the plaintiffs, the judge wrote.
The ruling marked the first permanent injunction that NetChoice, the nonprofit trade association for large tech companies that brought the suit, has obtained against similar laws it has challenged as violating free speech and enterprise online, according to a press release. 
NetChoice filed its lawsuit against the state in June 2023, and Brooks issued a preliminary injunction that August, about two weeks before the law was set to take effect on Sept. 1.   
The court’s ruling confirms NetChoice’s argument that restricting access to protected speech violates the First Amendment, the group’s litigation director, Chris Marchese, said in a statement. 
“This ruling protects Americans from having to hand over their IDs or biometric data just to access constitutionally protected speech online,” Marchese said. “It reaffirms that parents — not politicians or bureaucrats — should decide what’s appropriate for their children.”
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement Tuesday that he respects the court’s decision, adding that his office is evaluating its options.
Sanders called for lawmakers to amend Act 689 during her January State of the State address “so that it’s no longer held up in court and can begin to be enforced.” 
To date, no such amendments to the law have been proposed, but Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, told the Advocate last week he expects it to “happen one way or another” since the governor said it’s important to her. 
Brooks’ 41-page opinion on Monday granted NetChoice’s motion for summary judgment and declared that “NetChoice members and their users will suffer irreparable harm” if Act 689 takes effect because it “abridges the First Amendment rights of Arkansans who use social media and contains terms too vague to be reasonably understood.”
“The Court does not doubt the reality, well supported by the record, that unfettered social media access can and does harm minors,” Brooks wrote, adding that the state does have a compelling interest in protecting minors. 
“The state does not, however, have ‘a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,’” he said, quoting from another court’s opinion.

The law is “maximally burdensome” on both the social media platforms and the users it targets, the judge wrote.
“It erects barriers to accessing entire social media platforms rather than placing those barriers around the content or functions that raise concern,” he said. “It not only hinders adults’ ability to speak and receive protected speech online, it excludes minors whose parents do not consent (or cannot prove their consent)” from accessing forums on the internet.
If the Legislature’s intent “was to protect minors from materials or interactions that could harm them online, there is no evidence that the Act will be effective in achieving that goal,” the judge said.
“Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 simply impedes access to content writ large.”  
The law also “is unclear which NetChoice members are subject to regulation,” forcing some companies “to choose between risking enforcement penalties … and implementing age-verification requirements that burden their users’ First Amendment rights,” Brooks wrote.
NetChoice members whom the Act clearly regulates “would be pressed into service as the private censors of the State,” Brooks noted. “No legal remedy exists to compensate Arkansans for the loss of their First Amendment rights.”
The state argued that the act’s language made it clear that it covers Meta, Twitter (now X) and TikTok, but NetChoice argued that members like Snapchat, Nextdoor and Pinterest couldn’t be certain the law does not apply to them, according to the ruling. The state responded that the law didn’t apply to Snapchat because “it’s ‘different from a traditional social media platform.’” The law also specifically exempted YouTube and Google from having to verify users’ age.
The act is unconstitutionally vague because “it fails to adequately define which entities are subject to its requirements, risking chilling effects and inviting arbitrary enforcement,” according to the ruling.
Brooks concludes by stating “Act 689 is a content-based restriction on speech, and it is not targeted to address the harms the State has identified. Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel.”

Joe Lombardo speaking in Las Vegas Tuesday. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo on Tuesday downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of tariffs and other economic policies imposed by the Trump administration, saying Nevada will “make adjustments on the fly.”
Lombardo made his comments in Las Vegas at a press conference at a soon-to-open affordable housing complex for seniors, where he was highlighting his housing bill. The Nevada Housing Access and Attainability Act, as Assembly Bill 540 has been named, will be heard by the Nevada State Legislature’s Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee on Wednesday night. It promises to leverage $250 million in state funds to support more than $1 billion of new housing projects.
When asked about Trump tariffs driving up the cost of constructing new homes, Lombardo acknowledged that “tariffs are the great unknown,” before pivoting to saying his housing legislation is designed to be flexible enough to react to the needs of developers.
“We’ll make adjustments on the fly,” he said.
Housing groups have warned that Trump tariffs on lumber, steel, aluminium and other key goods will increase the cost of constructing homes. The National Association of Home Builders, whose Southern Nevada affiliate participated in Lombardo’s press event Tuesday, have estimated that 7% of all goods used in new residential construction are imported.
When asked about Trump’s broader economic policies and their potential negative impact on Nevada’s economy, Lombardo responded that it is the obligation of the governor and the Legislature to identify the state’s needs and prioritize.
“You have to triage what your priorities are,” he said. “You have to identify what the problems are, what the priorities are, and housing is a priority. Housing is a priority and we’ll make adjustments within the state budget’s services.”
Lombardo in his response also alluded to recent conversations about potential cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Those concerns, which were raised via letters and legislative hearings, are still pending as the federal budgeting process continues. Legislative Republicans have suggested they’d be more open to cutting services than raising revenue to backfill federal cuts.
Early data suggests international visitation to the United States is rapidly declining due to concerns about Trump’s trade wars, immigration enforcement without due process, and outlandish proposals to buy or take over other countries.
Lombardo, who was endorsed by Trump, has previously said that “Trump will bring down the rising costs of housing, groceries, and gas” and “oversee a new era of American prosperity.”

Over the last two years, the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee has been setting budgets differently by breaking the budgets into two pieces. 
The first piece is called a maintenance of operations budget. The maintenance budget represents a bare-bones version of the previous year’s budget with all of the one-time funding and new funding requests stripped out. The maintenance budget is simply intended to keep the lights on for state agencies. The maintenance budget for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office was included in an earlier bill, Senate Bill 1109, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law March 18.
The second piece of the budget is referred to as budget enhancements, or the enhanced budget. Budget enhancements include new funding requests or requests for additional staff positions. 
The budget enhancements for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office were included in Senate Bill 1202, which the Idaho House took up Tuesday. Combined with the maintenance budget, the budget enhancements bring total funding for fiscal year 2026 for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office to $83.2 million. The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, cut about $5 million from Gov. Brad Little’s $88.6 million funding request.
One of the differences between Little’s budget request and Senate Bill 1202 has to do with funding for personnel costs. Little sought to increase the rate for contracted attorneys from $100 per hour to $150 per hour. Senate Bill 1202 sets that rate at $125 per hour.

  Idaho is transitioning to a new statewide public defense system 

In October, Idaho transitioned from paying counties for public defense to a single, statewide system, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The transition to a new statewide system came following a 2015 ACLU of Idaho lawsuit alleging Idaho’s previous county-run public defense system violated low-income Idahoans’ Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel.  
Although the transition to a new statewide system is designed to address many of the concerns with the old system, the Sun has reported the process of moving from 44 different county systems to one statewide system has been rocky and troublesome.
Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, acknowledged frustrations with the transition, but said the new funding in the budget is necessary to help get the statewide system up, running and staffed to ensure Idahoans’ right to legal representation is honored.

“We have over 1,200 cases without an assigned attorney today, and we still have an obligation to correct and fix this problem and make sure we’re not leaving clients without that representation,” Manwaring said. 
After a 25-minute debate, the Idaho House voted 51-19 to pass Senate Bill 1202.
The day before, the Idaho Senate voted 23-12 to pass Senate Bill 1202.
Having passed both legislative chambers, Senate Bill 1202 heads next to Gov. Brad Little’s desk for final consideration. Once the budget bill reaches his desk, Little will have five days to sign it into law or veto it, otherwise it will become law without his signature.
  Idaho Legislature kills other budget enhancements for state agencies 

Even though the Idaho House passed the public defense budget Tuesday, the House killed two other budgets.
On Tuesday morning the Idaho House killed Senate Bill 1192, the budget enhancements for the Idaho State Liquor Division. That budget included new funding for shrink wrap that is required under the state’s new freight contract. 
In addition, the Idaho House on Tuesday also killed Senate Bill 1193, the budget enhancements for the Office of Information Technology Services. Senate Bill 1193 included $11.1 million in additional funding for new office space, security enhancements, emergency connectivity network enhancements, IT infrastructure investments, software and IT personnel transfers. 
The Idaho House was not alone in killing budgets. On Monday, the Idaho Senate killed House Bill 450, the budget enhancements for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. House Bill 450 included $800,000 in money from a settlement agreement with Idaho Power to help pay for restoration of wildlife habitat burned in the Valley Fire in the Boise foothills in October. 
Any of the budgets that were killed may still be rewritten before the Idaho Legislature adjourns for the year.

Tom Leek voting with Democrats against the proposal Tuesday.
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s proposal (SB 1284) could let parents claim damages for the mental pain and loss of support from the fetus, which the sponsor explained means parents could be awarded for the loss of future wages that the fetus could have earned over its life.

Although the bill passed its first hearing, its future could be in peril after former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, which it must go through before reaching the Senate floor, took issue with the bill’s definition of unborn child. She questioned Grall about whether someone could file a wrongful death suit for a fetus at one week of gestation.
“To put dollar figures on something and the damages being so speculative is different than a criminal prosecution,” Passidomo said. “I’m having trouble wrapping my arms around this whole issue.”
Passidomo’s doubts are not new. The Naples Republican also expressed skepticism over Grall’s bill last year before Grall withdrew it.
During Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, Democrats also bashed the bill, with Lori Berman, of Boynton Beach, calling the idea of a jury debating the potential salary of a fetus crazy, and Tina Polsky, of Boca Raton, calling it nonsensical.
“This person could be a waiter. This person could be the next Elon Musk. There is just absolutely no way to know, and it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever to try to calculate economic damages,” Polsky said.
Still, Grall defended treating a fetus the same as a day-old baby, questioning the other senators about what age would be appropriate to determine if the child would grow up to be wealthy.

How would the bill interact with Florida’s abortion landscape?

“So, at what age do we get to start to ascribe real damages to a person? At two?” Grall said. “Maybe we know how they’re doing; they’ve taken an IQ test.”
Passidomo also worried about OBGYNs leaving the state if they’re susceptible to more lawsuits.
“We’re losing OBGYNs. Who’s gonna wanna come to Florida?”
Unlike the proposal last year, SB 1284 doesn’t authorize wrongful death suits against a health care provider acting lawfully. But what lawful medical care means is too vague for Polsky, who said doctors are already hesitant to provide medically necessary abortions following the enactment of the law banning most abortions after six weeks’ gestation.
Florida’s six-week ban, which Grall sponsored, includes exceptions to save the life of the mother, fatal fetal abnormalities, and in cases of rape, incest, and human trafficking. However, doctors have spoken about the difficulties of assessing whether a case meets the exceptions, given that they can lose their medical licenses and face jail time if they provide an abortion outside the legal boundaries.
Additionally, Leek called out an amendment Grall made, switching language in the bill protecting pregnant people. He worried that the language didn’t go far enough to protect women from estranged partners. The original text stated that wrongful death action “may not be brought against the mother of the unborn child.” The bill now states that it doesn’t authorize such suits.
“My concern is more about this bill being weaponized against women who lose a child outside of abortion,” Leek said.
The House Judiciary committee is scheduled to hear the bill (HB 1517) on Wednesday in its last stop before the floor.

Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

(Courtesy of Commonwealth Media Services)On Tuesday, Gov. Josh Shapiro visited a timber business in Reedsville to highlight his administration’s investment in agricultural companies in the commonwealth. 
Mifflin County-based Metzler Forest Products is using a state grant to increase production of biochar, used by farmers to boost soil health and crop yields. 
But Shapiro had another message as well.
Ahead of the visit, his press team touted the appearance as an effort to showcase“efforts to support Pennsylvania farmers and agricultural innovation in the face of economic uncertainty.” During his speech, Shapiro framed his administration’s investments in Pennsylvania businesses in contrast with expected tariff announcements from President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

For weeks, Shapiro, who was considered as a running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, has been highlighting how Trump administration policies have impacted the state and its industries.
Last week, Shapiro announced a challenge to a Trump decision to cancel $13 million in federal funding to support Pennsylvania farmers and food banks. His office is also suing the administration over $2 billion of federal funding that was frozen early in the new administration.  Shapiro has claimed credit for getting the president to unfreeze them after he visited the White House.
“While the federal government imposes policies that hurt our economy, Pennsylvania is leading the way in driving economic growth — investing in agricultural innovation, supporting our manufacturers, and delivering real results for farmers and their families,” Shapiro said in Reedsville.
Metzler primarily sells domestically, which means they would theoretically avoid direct impacts from tariffs. And the money Metzler received was part of the Agricultural Innovation Grant program, which was created during budgets over the 2024-2025 budget, before Trump returned to office.

But Shapiro noted that Pennsylvania is among the country’s leading hardwood exporters.
Since the beginning of the agricultural innovation program, roughly $2 million has gone to hardwood projects. Nate Metzler, who spoke at the event, said the company was started by his father and employs over 80 people. 
Shapiro was joined by other Pennsylvania timber and hardwood industry members who discussed the potential  impacts of Trump’s tariffs.
Nick Gilson, the CEO of Selinsgrove-based Gilson Snow, which makes skis and snowboards, voiced his concern, since they’ve shipped products to 50 countries.
He said 50% of their exports have historically gone to Canada, where boycotts of American products are growing over Trump’s trade war and threats to take over the country and make it the 51st state.
Canada has long been one of America’s staunchest allies.
“I understand the intention behind the tariffs in protecting American manufacturing, but in actual practice, on the ground level, there are adverse side effects,” Gilson said. They raise input costs, strain supply chains and make it harder for American manufacturers to compete with foreign competitors. Beyond the cold economics, I also want to recognize that these tariffs are having an impact on the perception of American made goods.”

Shapiro was also joined by Mifflin County Commissioner Kevin Kodish, Executive Director of the Keystone Wood Products Association Stephanie Phillips-Taggart, and Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding.
Following the announcement, Shapiro’s office issued a press release saying the governor will be in Northampton County Wednesday to “support Pennsylvania brewers and small businesses in the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty.”

(Michael Reynolds/Getty Images)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks at 7 p.m. Monday by saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
 New Jersey senator talks immigration, health care, Social Security and more on U.S. Senate floor

Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
ICE admits to ‘administrative error’ in deporting Maryland man to El Salvador mega-prison

“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday.
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

Few Republicans broke ranks with party leadership on those or any other proposal put forth by Democrats, leading one lawmaker to wonder out loud why the chamber was bothering with debates.
“Why take us through this dog and pony show?” said state Rep. Marlene Terry, a Democrat from Bellefontaine Neighbors.

Democrats did win a few minor changes to the budget, but the biggest difference between the plan approved in the House Budget Committee last month and the bills given first round approval Monday were made by Republican amendments. In the Medicaid program, for example, the House cut about $50 million in general revenue matches to federal funds, arguing the funds were not needed because enrollment is not meeting earlier expectations.
A final series of votes on the 13 spending bills funding state operations will be held Thursday to send the budget to the state Senate. Three more bills, allocating money to capital improvements, are awaiting action in the House Budget Committee.
While the House worked on the budget, the state Senate debated a bill exempting long-term capital gains from state income tax. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said during debate that federal budget cuts could force Missouri to spend more state tax dollars on Medicaid.
Hough questioned whether a tax cut of about $335 million in the coming fiscal year was prudent. If the federal match rate for low-income adults added to the rolls since 2021 is changed from 90% to 80%, Hough said, it would require $300 million in additional general revenue.
 “That is a fairly scary financial forecast,” Hough said.
Hough has said he intends to use cash balances to fully fund the foundation formula and that he will support the increase for child care providers. 
The possibility of cuts in national spending — federal funds provide about 45% of Missouri’s budget — was also raised in the House.
“Our entire budget will be blown to bits if we lose federal funding,” said state Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Democrat from Springfield.
The state had a substantial balance of $3.8 billion in the general revenue fund as of Monday, down from historic high of about $5.7 billion set in 2023. The budget for the coming year anticipates leaving about $1.9 billion unspent.
Missouri received $13.4 billion in general revenue in the year that ended June 30 and the budget anticipates $13.5 billion for the coming fiscal year. 
The budget plan debated by the House cuts almost $800 million in general revenue and $2.1 billion overall less than the operating budget proposed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January. The spending proposal achieves those savings in part by cutting appropriations that had no funding available, by reducing Medicaid to match expected enrollment and by slicing Kehoe’s plan for state employee pay raises in half.
Instead of a raise of 1% for every two years in a state job, capped at 10%, the House pay plan is to provide a raise of 1% for every two years in a state job but capped at 5%.
Additions to the budget proposed by Kehoe include 105 earmarked items, including nine added Monday, with a total cost of $170 million. The House also added $28 million that will be distributed to state colleges and universities for deferred building maintenance.
The two biggest clashes of the day bookended the five-hour debate.
Only one Republican joined Democrats on a failed amendment to shift $50 million in general revenue from a tax credit program supporting private school tuition scholarships to the foundation formula. 
Democrats argued that the budget shortchanges public schools by failing to meet the new state adequacy target, which is a measure of how much high-performing districts spend per student. The House plan allows for a state adequacy target of $6,760 per student instead of the $7,145 that resulted from the calculation mandated by state law. 
To boost foundation formula funding, state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, tried to strip out $50 million for the MOScholars program, which was supposed to be funded by donations tied to tax credits.
Too many of the private schools participating in the scholarship program won’t accept students with developmental disabilities or who won’t participate in religious instruction, Fogle said. 
“I can’t think of anything more frustrating to me, personally, than my tax dollars going to a school that wouldn’t have educated me, that wouldn’t have educated a lot of people in this body,” she said.
Defending the set-aside for the scholarship program, Republicans said the influx of state cash will help hundreds more students.
“This is a historic investment in our children’s future, fostering flexibility around parental involvement and educational freedom for our kids,” said state Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican from Neosho.
While the budget plan accepted Kehoe’s proposal for scholarships, it did not include his $107 million plan for child care subsidies. The system for delivering payments has been plagued by mistakes and delays and some providers have closed as a result.
Hein sought to restore about $85 million of the cut.
“We have the opportunity to fix the situation and bring the state into compliance with federal rules,” Hein said. “We can stabilize the child care industry and help our workforce.”
Republicans, however, said the expense will have to be paid from general revenue in the future and it is too costly. The problems with the payment system are solved, said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, and a change now could cause problems to resurface.
“Changing how you pay providers from attendance to enrollment is not just flipping a switch over at the Department of Elementary Secondary Education,” he said. “There are substantial software changes that have to be made.”

Brad Little vetoed a bill that would’ve banned medical intervention mandates — including vaccines, medical treatment or medicine — by businesses, governments, schools and colleges, the Idaho Legislature’s immediate path forward to respond remains unclear.
The governor vetoed the bill Saturday. 
On Monday, the Idaho Senate introduced a new tweaked version of the bill. On Tuesday, the Idaho House made a similar move. 
But the Senate has not officially attempted to override the governor’s veto; the original bill narrowly passed the Senate and would need broader support to pass a veto override, which requires two-thirds support in each legislative chamber.

Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, hasn’t ruled out a vote to override the governor’s veto on the bill, he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon. But first, he said, lawmakers are focused on working with the governor “to come up with language that is doable.”
Asked if the Senate would override the governor’s veto, Anthon told the Sun “It very well could happen. But until we know that the road … is completely at a dead end, you won’t see that happen. I think you’re going to first see, ‘Can we work with the governor to come up with language that is doable?’ But you may not want to play that card or give up that leverage until you know you can’t work out a deal.”

 Revised legislation surfaces in both the Idaho House and Senate

The Senate’s revised bill, Senate Bill 1210, exempts day cares and adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more. The House’s revised bill, House Bill 472, adds language specifying that the bill wouldn’t overrule existing powers of school districts, or school board trustees — as already granted in Idaho law.
To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto.
Right now, the Legislature is in the middle of a negotiation, Anthon told the Sun, and he doubts the new bills will become law as drafted.
“I personally think that none of those bills, as printed, will end up becoming law,” he said.
The new bills appear to be competing versions of revised bills that attempt to address the governor’s concerns over the original vetoed bill.

Explaining his veto of the original bill, Senate Bill 1023, Little said he valued medical freedom but worried that the bill “removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions,” including measles. 
The Idaho governor’s office couldn’t be immediately reached for comment about how much either bill addresses Little’s concerns over the original bill, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act.
“Once the bill got vetoed … we start down a road where we try to figure out ‘What’s a bill that can actually pass both Houses?” Anthon told the Sun. “And so you start to see the clamor of legislation.”
The Idaho Legislature is more than a week past Republican leadership’s nonbinding goal to adjourn, or end, this year’s legislative session on March 21 — largely due to budgeting delays by the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, the Sun previously reported. 
  Senate revised bill pulled last minute from committee agenda

On Tuesday afternoon, the revised Senate bill was scheduled to be considered in the Senate State Affairs Committee, where it could’ve been advanced to the full Senate for a vote. But the meeting was canceled.

Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, cosponsored the original bill that the governor vetoed and the revised Senate bill. He declined to comment on the bill’s future to the Sun on Tuesday. 
Senate State Affairs Committee Chairman Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, told the Sun in a Tuesday interview that Foreman had asked him to remove the bill from the committee’s agenda. But Guthrie said he didn’t know Foreman’s reasons.
Anthon, the top Senate Republican, told the Sun that Foreman “is working really, really hard to get a policy across the finish line that effectuates, at the end of the day, the goal — and the goal is to get that medical freedom piece in place.”
“How to fine tune that language to get all of the different players happy is very difficult. So there’s a negotiation taking place,” Anthon said. “Sometimes you have to throw out a piece of legislation to get people to the table. So Senator Forman has done that. It looks like the House has done that a couple of times now. And once that piece of legislation is printed, the dialog starts. So I think we’re just in the middle of a process.”

 Idaho AG, who lost a challenge to Gov. Little, urged Legislature to override veto

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador on Monday urged the Idaho Legislature to override the governor’s veto, calling the bill “the defining bill of this session.”
“Five years ago, COVID-19 brought chaos: lockdowns, mandates, business closures, school shutdowns, and restrictions that crushed our freedom,” Labrador said in a prepared statement. “In hindsight, the damage to our society, children, and economy was far worse than the virus itself. I ran for Attorney General because our State failed to protect our citizens from government overreach. The legislature now has the opportunity to do the right thing.”
Labrador is a former U.S. House of Representatives member. In 2018, he lost a Republican primary governor’s election challenge to Little. In 2022, Labrador was elected as Idaho attorney general. 
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, also supported a legislative veto override. Before Little vetoed the bill, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill.
 How the bill works: Banning medical intervention mandates — beyond vaccines

Both bills introduced this week modify a bill that previously passed the Legislature, and was vetoed by Little. 
The original bill would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.

The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Foreman and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)As the Senate chamber emptied on Tuesday afternoon, a sergeant-at-arms cleared off the desk of Sen. Jason Ellsworth. 
The Montana Senate voted 44-6 to punish the Hamilton Republican, for his failure to disclose a conflict of interest in procuring a contract for a close friend, and for a “pattern of abuse.”
In making the motion, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said the punishment was for more than just the conflict of interest which was the focus of a Senate Ethics Committee. He said it encompassed years of wrongdoings by Ellsworth, including running afoul of the Federal Trade Commission more than a decade ago, two altercations with law enforcement, and the work done late last year to a $170,100 contract that skirted procurement rules. 
“I think this is appropriate,” McGillvray told his colleagues on the floor. “These incidents were very, very serious and the Senate should respond accordingly.” 
Ellsworth, who apologized for only an appearance of impropriety, voted remotely against his own censure. He did not respond to texts or phone calls about his censure. 
Last week, the Senate voted twice on motions to expel Ellsworth, but couldn’t get to the 2/3 majority (34 votes) needed to punish or expel a member, as a majority of Democrats voted against expulsion. Another expulsion vote taken before the censure also failed. 
Negotiations between McGillvray and Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, took place over the last week, up until Tuesday when McGillvray said he crafted the final language that went “right up to” the line of expulsion. 
The censure includes the following:

Removal from Senate standing committees
No assignment to interim committees
No verbal contact with executive branch directors or legislative staff, unless Ellsworth is first contacted by them. 
Revocation of access to legislator or legislative services office space
Revocation of floor privileges for life

For the remainder of the session, all Ellsworth can do in an official capacity is vote, remotely, on second and third readings of bills, and on motions made on the floor. Former legislators are allowed floor access after they serve, but Ellsworth will not be allowed to enter the Senate chamber again.

Regier told reporters after the vote that he remained disappointed that the chamber was unable to muster the votes to expel Ellsworth, casting blame on the minority caucus. 
“This is everything that the public of Montana does not like about politicians, and we didn’t expel that from the system,” Regier said. “I’m still for (expulsion), still disappointed that the Democrat party didn’t stand up and get rid of corruption. But I am glad, as a conciliatory action, that action was taken and there was repercussions.”
McGillvray added he felt the Democrats likely prevented the expulsion of Ellsworth to secure a vote on legislation. 
“Democrats don’t protect corrupt Republicans out of principle,” he said.
Six members voted against the censure, including two Democrats — Sen. Ellie Boldman and Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy. Two Great Falls Republicans Sens. Jeremy Trebas and Daniel Emrich had voted for expulsion but not for the censure, and Wendy McKamey, also of Great Falls, voted against the censure. 
Both Democrats spoke on the floor about their reasons for resisting the motion. Windy Boy said he thought there should be a progressive warning system before a punishment was enacted, while Boldman said she still doubted the fairness of the entire process and felt that revoking floor privileges for life went too far. 
“The political witch hunt needs to stop,” she said. 
Many members of the Republican majority, however, still favored expulsion. 
Sen. Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, who led the Senate Ethics Committee, made a substitute motion to expel Ellsworth, which failed on a tie vote. 
“I don’t see what has changed in the last week that would change my mind that expulsion is the most appropriate punishment,” he said. “I feel the infractions of the Senator from Senate District 43 has made over the course of his service in the Senate makes him unsuitable for office.” 
Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, also served on the Ethics Committee and again made his case that censure was the best route and would be a “very black mark” on Ellsworth. 
“I think there’s a sense in this body that our colleague has really fallen and that there needs to be consequences,” Pope said. “We also, as a body, I think, have been interested in being judicious and being fair, but being very explicit as to what the punishment and what the long term need is here for this body to express itself, and its commitment to transparency and integrity and decorum.”
Flowers said he felt the censure was fair, even though it went further than what his party had initially proposed — including the revocation of floor privileges and speaking to legislative staff — and for the most part his caucus had been happy with where things ended up. 
“I applaud the Ethics Committee for being as efficient as possible with that effort and fair, but it did take a lot of time and energy, and I think just brought a kind of a little bit of a pall on our proceedings in here,” Flowers said. “I think all of us are ready and happy to be moving on.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the state Corrections Department for violations of New Mexico’s public records law.
In the suit, the Albuquerque-based nonprofit NMFOG alleges both specific and ongoing violations by NMCD of the Inspection of Public Records Act, citing at least nine successful lawsuits against the agency resulting in $365,000 worth of damages and fees paid by the state.
But it’s not your typical lawsuit trying to get a court to force a government agency to fork over some records — NMFOG wants a judge to declare that the Corrections Department must respect the public’s right to inspect records now and in the future.
The suit stems from FOG’s IPRA request in 2024 for three years’ worth of NMCD financial records showing settlement amounts paid out after IPRA lawsuits. The department denied that request. 
The new suit asks the court to require the agency to produce those records, and to explain which records it withheld in another request. 
Moreover, the organization is asking the court to issue an order requiring Corrections to comply with the state law going forward and alleges the department “has a history, practice and pattern of failing to comply” with IPRA and continues to do so despite losing in court time and time again. 
The complaint details legal settlements paid using public funds by the department in response to IPRA suits brought over the last three years by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, Disability Rights New Mexico and a formerly incarcerated person.
In an email to Source NM on Tuesday afternoon, Corrections Department Spokesperson Brittany Roembach declined to comment on pending litigation.
‘Tip of the iceberg’
The complaint describes the prior lawsuits it cites as “the tip of the iceberg of the actual number of successful IPRA enforcement actions against” the department, and does not capture all of its IPRA violations.
Indeed, the New Mexico Prison and Jail Project has filed four other lawsuits against the department in the last five years over allegations of withholding records based on internal policies or withholding records until sued, according to court records.
NMFOG says in the complaint an injunction “is the only adequate remedy,” because requiring them to pay money for violating the law won’t stop them from doing it in the future.
NMFOG also points out that the New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled last May in a suit by the ACLU-NM seeking documents about the department’s use of force policies, that the department’s policies or rules “cannot be used to exempt public records from inspection under IPRA.”
That ruling “has also failed to deter Defendant NMCD from persisting in hiding behind its internal rules to unlawfully shield public records,” the complaint states.
The department appealed the ruling to the New Mexico Supreme Court, which on Sept. 6, 2024 agreed to hear the case, according to court records. The case has not yet been scheduled for argument at the Supreme Court.
In the complaint, NMFOG insists that the appeals court ruling is still good law, even though the Supreme Court has agreed to review it, because the Supreme Court hasn’t nullified the lower court’s ruling in any way.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_6820-scaled-e1657153109251-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

(NIOSH | Courtesy photo)Approximately 200 federal jobs are being eliminated at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown, an official of a union representing workers there said Tuesday. Hundreds of the facility’s lab animals are expected to be euthanized. 
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040, said she’d received word that all 185 bargaining unit employees will be part of a reduction in force. In addition, management officials at the office have been put on administrative leave and will be part of the reduction in force, she said. 
She estimates that altogether, 210 staff positions have been eliminated.
“It’s devastating. People will die,” Tinney-Zara said of the effects of the cuts. Officials at the facility were told the cuts were because the services there were not needed or were duplicative, she said. 
“There is no one else in the government that does occupational safety and health,” she said. “There’s no one else in the U.S. We’re the only group, NIOSH, that does occupational safety and health. We do the research to make everyone’s job safer.”
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, which oversees NIOSH, will decrease its workforce by 2,400, in accordance with President Donald Trump’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” 
Overall, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will reduce staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 and consolidate 28 divisions into 15. Staffing cuts are expected to save $1.8 billion per year. 
The changes will improve Americans’ experience with the agency by making it more responsive and efficient, while ensuring that Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential health services remain intact, the organization said in a statement. 
“Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said in the statement. “This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That’s the entire American public, because our goal is to Make America Healthy Again.”
The Morgantown facility had 674 mice and 37 rats for use in studies that will likely be destroyed, Tinney-Zara said. Law requires the facility to have a veterinarian when working with the animals. The veterinarian was let go, she said. Some of the studies have been going on for decades, but are being ended.
“All of our animals, it appears, will have to be euthanized,” Tinney-Zara said. “And to make matters worse, there was a shipment of animals that came in today that the CDC DOGE person approved the purchase of these animals. They just came into the facility. They’re going to have to be euthanized.”
Tinney-Zara spoke with West Virginia Watch Tuesday afternoon as she cleaned out her office of more than 30 years. She said she received notice around 5 a.m. Tuesday that she was being fired and that she’d lose access to the facility by midnight. 
“Everyone’s running around here with tears in their eyes and yeah, it’s just been an insane day,” she said. 
An original notice last week listed administrative roles that were to be affected. 
“Then, all of a sudden it was our whole entire facility,” she said. 
Tinney-Zara said the Morgantown cuts will have a far-reaching effect on the economy in the city and the rest of the state. 
“Let’s see, take approximately 210 people that many of them have Ph.D.s and are scientists, and have years of experience and new researchers coming on board and take them out of the market, take all of their tax dollars, and it will have a drastic economic impact,” she said. “And that can be both local and statewide.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)An election measure raising citizenship-related roadblocks to voter eligibility won approval in a Florida House committee on Tuesday, but not before receiving criticism from members of he public — some who thought it is far too restrictive, and others who thought it isn’t tough enough.
Fort Myers Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka presented her bill (HB 1381) before the House Government Operations Subcommittee. It now has two more stops before going to the floor.
A variety of bills in the Senate carry some of its provisions, although perhaps the most similar, proposed by GOP Sen. Blaise Ingoglia (SB 1414), has yet to be heard in any committee.
Persons-Mulicka noted that her measure is in part a response to the executive order published last week by President Donald Trump that would require prospective voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.
“This bill fully answers the president,” she said.
The measure contains numerous provisions ostensibly to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote. It says that if an applicant has not provided the necessary evidence of their legal status, or is not verified before the applicant requests a vote-by-mail ballot or presents to vote, the applicant must be provided a provisional ballot that can be counted only if they confirm their legal status by 5 p.m. on the Thursday after a Tuesday election.
The bill also says that a supervisor of elections must remove the name of a deceased voter from the voter rolls within seven days if they receive a copy of a death certificate or a published obituary or notice of death, a letter of probate or estate administration, or “personal knowledge” of a registered voter’s death.
Other provisions include:

The state’s division of elections office can use lists from federal agencies or other state governments to remove voters from the rolls.
It requires jury coordinators for federal jury duty to create a list of those disqualified for not being U.S. citizens and to provide it to the Florida Division of Elections according to the jury summons cycle used by the court clerk.
Eliminates certain categories of voter identification options such as student identification, debit or credit cards, and retirement cards.
Changes from “challenge” to “protest” voter challenges of vote-by-mail ballots.
In a manual review of ballots open to the public, the bill says that each political party may designate one person with “expertise in the computer field” who must be allowed in the central counting room where all tests are being conducted and where the official votes are being counted.
Requires all voting to be by paper ballot, unless a person with a disability requires a voter-interface device.
Would make Florida first state in the nation to require an automated, independent vote validation process for every ballot cast in every election before certification.

Cathi Chamberlain, who works with “voting integrity” advocates skeptical of election security, complained the proposal “does not go far enough,” preferring a bill presented by Pinellas Republican Rep. Berny Jacques.
“We believe it still does not fully align with President Trump’s executive order,” she said. “It does not remove and prosecute noncitizens already on our voting rolls. It does not address vote by mail or technology security.”
Jonathan Webber, policy director with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the measure was a voter suppression bill.
“Millions of our family members, friends, and neighbors lived through Jim Crow,” he said. “Poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation used to silence Black voters across the Deep South. Not because they weren’t citizens, but because the system was built to block their voices. This amendment continues that legacy, just with cleaner language and more paperwork.”
Praise
Karen Jaroch of Heritage Action called it an “excellent bill.”
“The amended bill 1381 delivers targeted reforms that rebuild voter trust,” she said. “Voter roll accuracy is also important. Section 6 authorizes data sharing with other states to purge deceased or ineligible voters. And Section 8 leverages federal jury data to flag ineligible voters. That’s smart practical reforms to protect every lawful vote.”
Pasco County Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb argued the proposal is necessary. “The threat is real because of illegals voting,” he said.
Broward County Democratic Rep. Darryl Campbell disagreed, saying the measure wasn’t about fraud, but about fear.
Orlando Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy later attempted to introduce an amendment that would essentially wipe out Persons-Mulicka’s bill and insert her own proposal (HB 1409), which included automatic registration for eligible Floridians to vote when they interact with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), unless they opt-out.
Her amendment also included a centralized database for returning citizens to determine voter eligibility; permanent vote-by-mail requests; and would allow eligible voters to register to vote at any time, up to and including Election Day.
The committee voted down her amendment along party lines.

The new cases impacted a very young child, one school-aged child and two adults, according to the state’s website. New Mexico’s current cases include 25 adults, 14 children aged 5 to 17 and nine very young children ages 0 to 4-years old, mostly in unvaccinated people.
Measles cases in Eddy County remain unchanged at two, with the remaining 46 cases in Lea County.
“Measles is highly contagious, and our department continues to keep the public educated about the spread, which is still confined to the southeast portion of our state,” New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM.  “But we must remain vigilant about any case count increase related to the outbreak. We are continually encouraging New Mexicans to get the MMR vaccination – their best protection from the virus.”
NMDOH vaccinated more than 14,800 New Mexicans between Feb. 1 and March 31, Nott said.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes, which hang in the air for hours. Symptoms often take weeks to develop, and people can spread the virus days before showing a fever, cough, red eyes or the spotty red rash. Severe complications can occur with a measles infection, including brain swelling, blindness, pneumonia and death. About one in five cases merits hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
State officials warned last month that a Texas traveler in early March exposed people in Valencia and Guadalupe counties. Nott told Source NM the department has no updates since that alert.
Texas on Tuesday reported 22 more cases since Friday, bringing its total to 422 cases since early January; more than 66% of the cases are in Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak first began.
The deaths earlier this year of a 6-year old Texas child, and a Lea County adult, both unvaccinated, were the first measles deaths in the U.S. in a decade.
Vaccine records can be found at the Vax View website or by calling the NMDOH immunization program at 1-833-882-6454, available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Measles and misinformation
The measles outbreak, which now includes cases in more than 20 states, has been marked by tension over the federal Health and Human Services Department’s lack of a full-throated vaccination campaign, a departure from the traditional response from the country’s largest public health agency, including the 1989 outbreak.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who founded the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, has instead called vaccines a “personal choice.” In February, the entire New Mexico congressional delegation called upon Kennedy to take stronger action against the outbreak.
Just last week, the top vaccine scientist at the Food and Drug Administration resigned, criticizing Kennedy for “lies and misinformation” around vaccines.
Dr. Peter Marks, who played a key role in the swift development and deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine, wrote in his March 28 resignation letter that the ongoing multistate measles outbreak had resulted from public officials undermining “confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being.”
In interviews, Kennedy has also endorsed unproven treatments, which, if misused, could have lasting harms, doctors told Source NM. For instance, in a March 4 interview with Fox News, Kennedy said there were “very, very good results” from treating the illness with steroids, antibiotics and cod liver oil, which is high in Vitamins A and D.
Pediatrician Dr. Melissa Mason told Source NM that steroids and antibiotics may be used to treat complications from severe cases of measles — such as severe inflammation or secondary ear or lung infections — but they do not treat measles itself.
“People unnecessarily using steroids and antibiotics can actually cause harm — that should really only be done under close supervision of a physician,” she said.
Two doses of the vaccine remains the only safe and effective prevention against measles, said Mason, who chairs the immunization committee for the New Mexico Pediatric Society.
Mason’s other concern is that misinformation about Vitamin A, which is used for treating serious cases of measles, is being falsely touted by anti-vaccine advocates as prevention. Vitamin A — unlike other vitamins — can cause liver damage in too high of doses, Mason said.
“In serious cases, the measles virus depletes the body’s supply of Vitamin A,” she said. “Only for hospitalized patients under the care of a physician, if it is shown that they are low in vitamin A, only then is it appropriate to treat with vitamin A.”
The New York Times reported that doctors in Gaines County, Texas, are treating children with measles with liver damage from taking too much Vitamin A outside of doctor’s orders.
No such cases have been reported in Lea or Eddy counties, according to data from the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center at the University of New Mexico. Mason said  anti-vaccine misinformation preys on people who are concerned for their children.
“I think people are scared and, when they’re scared, they’re looking for anything that they can use or try to stay healthy and safe,” she said. “But you need to be careful and cautious with things that you were trying to use to be healthy and safe and actually use things that are proven.”

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The case of a Columbia University activist who is facing deportation because of his pro-Palestinian protests on the school’s campus will remain in New Jersey, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz rejected a push by federal prosecutors to move the case to Louisiana, where the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, has been detained since soon after immigration agents arrested him March 8. Farbiarz said New Jersey’s federal courts have jurisdiction over Khalil’s case because he was detained in Elizabeth at the time his lawyer filed his plea for release.
“This case, as filed on March 9 at 4:40 am, can go forward in New Jersey because that is where the Petitioner was confined at that moment,” Farbiarz wrote in the 67-page ruling.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident married to a U.S. citizen, faces no criminal charge. His case has garnered national attention as the government attempts to revoke his green card status, saying his anti-Israel protests amount to support for terrorist group Hamas.
Appearing in Farbiarz’s Newark courtroom on Friday, attorneys for the Trump administration argued that federal courts in Louisiana were the proper jurisdiction for Khalil’s case because that’s where he is detained. Kahlil’s legal team said prosecutors were hoping to get Khalil’s case before a judge who would be friendlier to their side, commonly referred to as forum shopping.
Farbiarz in Tuesday’s decision said court rules channel certain cases to particular courts, partly to limit forum shopping.
“The Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40 am,” Farbiarz wrote. “And under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40 am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.”
Baher Azmy, one of Khalil’s attorneys, said the legal team is grateful the court “understood that the government cannot try to manipulate the jurisdiction of the United States courts in a transparent attempt to shield their unconstitutional – and frankly chilling – behavior.”
The next step in Khalil’s case is to get him out of detention, Azmy said.
Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is nine months pregnant and expecting to give birth this month, said in a statement that she is “relieved” at the court’s decision.
“This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud’s freedom, but there is still a lot more to be done. As the countdown to our son’s birth begins and I inch closer and closer to my due date, I will continue to strongly advocate for Mahmoud’s freedom and for his safe return home so he can be by my side to welcome our first child,” she said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced legislation Tuesday to ban DEI offices and officers in certain public and private entities while noting there are proposed changes in the bill still to come.
House File 856 would bar state entities, including universities and community colleges as well as private universities, from spending any funds, public or private, on diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officers, with some exceptions. If found to be noncompliant with the law, private universities would become ineligible for the Iowa Tuition Grant program until they make changes — meaning students who receive Iowa Tuition Grant dollars would not be able to spend them at the offending universities.
The section of the bill pertaining to private universities was the main topic of discussion for members of the public, both in opposition and support. It was also the section that subcommittee chairman Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, told those gathered he would be submitting an amendment to remove.
In the Iowa Tuition Grant’s more than 50-year history, Rozenboom said the Legislature has never added conditions to the program, and if it starts now, more conditions will added later.
“I’m very uncomfortable, personally … with dipping our toe into conditioning the Iowa Tuition Grant,” Rozenboom said.

He and Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, signed off on the legislation, with Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, abstaining.
Patty Alexander, who identified herself as a “concerned mom,” was joined by other parents and lobbyists in support of the legislation. Inspired Life lobbyist Amber Williams said the bill will stop division sowed by DEI policies and activities and protects students from being judged by their demographics rather than their efforts and merit.
“I support this bill because it will hold higher learning institutions accountable and allow them to make corrections, and will ensure that the unhealthy and misguided pursuit of power, which DEI supports, will not be tolerated,” Alexander said.
Interfaith Alliance of Iowa lobbyist and Executive Director Connie Ryan opposed the bill and said DEI is about both acknowledging past disparities between different groups and their effects, and also about setting up every Iowan for support and success in the future.
The concepts of DEI are key to ensuring members of Iowa’s institutions, educational or not, are provided opportunities without erecting barriers, she said.
“That’s the goal of diversity, equity and inclusion. It should be the goal of Iowa’s elected officials,” Ryan said. “We are grateful that you took out private institutions. We hope that you would take out the rest of the language as well.”
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board is registered as “undecided” on the bill, but it is “generally supportive” of moving away from DEI, as is happening on the federal level.
With other legislation targeting DEI moving through the Statehouse, Carlson said the board would appreciate lawmakers aligning the varying definitions of DEI included in different bills, which Quirmbach and Rozenboom acknowledged.
Quirmbach said he was happy to hear of Rozenboom’s intentions to remove private universities from the bill, but said he wished community colleges and public universities were also included in the proposed amendment.
Echoing comments he made during debate of Senate File 507, which would bar local governments from utilizing DEI practices, Quirmbach said the ideas making up DEI are an asset to organizations wanting to ensure they have the best people and training for the job.
“In general, looking for people of high merit, you want to have the broadest possible pool of candidates,” Quirmbach said. “The bigger the pool, the more likely you’re going to find somebody who is absolutely, spectacularly wonderful. But there are certain groups that aren’t typically recruited.”
One acronym brought up by supporters of the bill was MEI — or merit, excellence and intelligence. Rozenboom said the tenets of MEI have been replaced over the years with DEI, with negative consequences.
Both he and Kraayenbrink said the public signaled its wish to do away with DEI in the last election, and this legislation will help clean up the mess.
“MEI resonates with me a lot more than DEI does, and I hope that’s the direction we can head from now on,” Rozenboom said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The state’s mental health commissioner on Tuesday said the agency is dealing with a $43 million shortfall, which some say has resulted in cuts to providers.
Commissioner Allie Friesen spoke with providers who contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services during  an emotional meeting. . 
Officials originally believed the shortfall was $63.7 million, she told providers who expressed frustration with the sudden cuts.
“So, the $43 million is the number,” Friesen said during the meeting. “It’s a fun, super fun dance to try to manage the Legislature and the executive branch. They hate each other, and I can’t win.”
She said she doesn’t have the tolerance for politics getting in the way of patient care.
“If we can remove the political egos from the situation and focus on those that need our care, then we’ll get it figured out,” Friesen said. “So that’s what I am going to be advocating for, and that might mean I get fired.”
A spokesperson for the agency, Kelsey Davis, later said the exact amount of the shortfall is under investigation.
Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Friesen, who was appointed by Stitt in January 2024, said the agency will likely ask for a larger budget request for fiscal year 2026 than it has ever had, but it is unlikely it will get it.
Oklahoma Voice also asked the agency for more specifics about the cuts following the meeting.
“At this time, no payments have been cancelled,” Friesen said in a statement. “An email was sent to providers regarding potential changes to value-based payments, but we continue to evaluate the best path forward.”
Janet Cizek is CEO of Community Treatment Integrations with offices in Tulsa and Bartlesville and attended the meeting. Her organization specializes in treating substance abuse disorders and cares for about 8,000 clients a year.
It received value-based payments for good outcomes, such as a client’s sobriety or maintaining employment. Value-based care payments reward providers who give high-quality care that improve health care outcomes.
On March 18, Cizek said providers received an email saying the contract had been terminated retroactively to Oct.1, meaning no reimbursement for some services already provided. Without the services, some may go to jail and others may die, she said.
“Claiming that no contracts have been cut is disingenuous at best,” she said.
Last month, Stitt called for an audit of the agency after Friesen brought the financial issues to his attention.
Legislative leaders said the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency will determine why the “unacceptable shortfall exists, in its breadth, and how to prevent it from ever occurring again.”
Last month, Stitt said the agency’s chief financial officer had been replaced.
Richard Edwards, former chief financial officer, said he resigned under the threat of termination.
In a letter to lawmakers provided to Oklahoma Voice, Edwards wrote that he was “taken aback” by Friesen’s allegations and denied any wrongdoing. He offered to cooperate with the investigation.
Edwards said Tuesday he was a “convenient scapegoat,” for the current leadership, which continues to blame prior leaders for the financial situation.
Some of the problems the agency is having are related to Friesen’s leadership, Edwards said.
A number of high-level staff, chiefs or deputies were brought in under her tenure, he said.
The agency also purchased furniture, vehicles and other items that contributed to the financial problems, although in a relatively small way, he said.
Davis, the mental health spokesperson, said it would not be appropriate to comment on remarks from a former employee.
House Appropriations and Budget Committee Chairman Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said the agency’s past administration had been paying prior year bills with new money, and it caught up with them.
He said a supplemental appropriation is possible, but lawmakers need a firm number from the executive branch. 
The shortfall figure keeps changing, he said.
Meanwhile, the agency has asked the Oklahoma Legislature for another $124 million to cover overrun costs for the construction of a new inpatient mental health hospital, the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus in Oklahoma City.
It is intended to replace the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House approved a priority bill pushed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday that is meant to incentivize the creation of microgrids and data centers in the state.
Members of the House voted 88-12 in support of House Bill 2014. Republican Dels. Marty Gearheart, R-Mercer; Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio and Jordan Bridges, R-Logan, joined the chamber’s nine Democrats in voting against it. The bill now heads to the Senate for introduction and consideration.
The bill’s passage in the House came one day before a deadline that requires all bills to be passed out of their chamber of origin in order for them to be considered by the other chamber and sent to the governor’s desk by the final night of session on April 12.
HB 2014 — dubbed as the Power Generation and Consumption Act — will allow companies seeking to build data centers to create their own, independent energy grids to power them. 
Data centers are large facilities that house vast computer systems used for cloud storage, artificial intelligence computing and telecommunications; the centers require massive amounts of energy and electricity to run.
Through using their own microgrids, proponents for the policy say data centers would be able to operate in West Virginia without overburdening the state’s power and utility infrastructure or raising electricity rates for existing residential and commercial customers. 
Under the proposed bill, the state’s certified microgrid program would operate under the newly reorganized Division of Economic Development. Through approval from the division, data companies looking to operate in West Virginia would do so in “high impact industrial business development microgrid districts.” 
There, instead of being required to connect to the existing utilities in the region, they would create their own, smaller energy grids with the primary purpose of powering the data centers. Per the bill, 10% of electricity generated by the microgrids but not used by the data centers or industrial facilities would be allowed to be sold on the wholesale market to others nearby, potentially at lower rates than existing utilities currently offer.
The initial version of HB 2014 — the one specifically requested by Morrisey — included provisions that would have required electric utilities with coal fired plants to operate at 69% capacity and hold a 45-day supply of coal on hand at all times. Most coal fired power plants in the state operate at an average 40% capacity and stockpile a 30-day supply of coal.
Those provisions were meant to support the state’s coal industry, but power companies — including Appalachian Power, the state’s largest electric utility — said it would be difficult to meet those standards and doing so would have raised rates for existing electric customers in the state.
Through a committee substitute for HB 2014 passed by the House Energy and Public Works Committee last week, the coal-backed provisions were removed from the bill and not included in the version passed by the House on Tuesday.
In response to concerns raised by House members on the floor Tuesday regarding the potential for the bill to increase utility rates for residential customers, Del. Clay Riley, R-Harrison, said he actually believes HB 2014 could lead to savings for residents, though indirectly, through tax revenue generated locally and a fund that will be created by the legislation.
I do not believe [HB 2014] is going to increase [customer electric rates],” said Riley, a longtime proponent for data centers in the state and a sponsor of the bill. “I think it puts more money back in the pockets of citizens of West Virginia, both in terms of ratepaying and in terms of personal income taxes and some of the other things that I think I’ve seen in there.”
Riley said he estimates that roughly $160 million to $200 million will be generated in tax revenue annually for a county that houses a data center and microgrid. 
Following the payment of property taxes to the appropriate local agencies, other revenue from the data centers and related microgrids will be split between several statewide initiatives, including to: the Personal Income Tax Reduction Fund to offset personal income tax cuts, the Economic Development Closing and Promotion Fund to help recruit more businesses to the state, the Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant Fund for water and sewage projects, the Department of Human Services’ Low Income Energy Assistance Program to help low-income families cover utility bills, the state general revenue fund and the newly created Electronic Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
The Electronic Grid Stabilization and Security Fund, Riley said, could help utility companies cover the cost of maintenance and repairs in their infrastructure that would otherwise be — and often are — baked into customer rate increases. In other words, while that won’t directly decrease power costs for residents, it could offset future expenses they would incur.
Del. Henry Dillon, R-Wayne, said in addition to limiting future increases for ratepayers, the data centers and microgrids could mean a population and employment bump for the regions they’re located in. Jobs will be created while the facilities are being constructed, he said, and after that it’s likely that at least some jobs will stay in the areas.
That could help decrease another major factor that often leads to utility rate increases: population loss.
Dillon said, at first, he shared similar concerns to others worried that this initiative could lead to lackluster results and heavy costs for existing residents.
“But throughout the process of working on this bill … I believe that the governor is going in the right direction here,” Dillon said. “This is an attempt to innovate. This is an attempt to take a new approach to energy policy in the state, and it’s not going to harm our utility companies. It’s not going to harm ratepayers, it’s not going to harm oil and gas. It’s not going to harm coal. I believe that this is a net positive for the state.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Clay-Riley-20250401.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Four North Dakota lawmakers announced they will be joining the national Future Caucus made up of millennial and Gen-Z legislators with hopes of finding bipartisan solutions to common problems.
North Dakota is the 36th state to join the Future Caucus, which began in 2013 and includes more than 1,900 young lawmakers nationwide.
Co-chairs for the North Dakota chapter are Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, Rep. Dawson Holle, R-Mandan, Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, and Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo.
“These leaders represent the best of North Dakota,” said Layla Zidane, president of the Future Caucus. 
She added North Dakota has a longstanding tradition of putting people above politics, which is exactly what the Future Caucus is trying to achieve – focusing on real solutions, not partisan fights.
“We’re not bringing in outside priorities,” Zidane said. “But really amplifying the amazing leadership that is already here.”
She said members of the Future Caucus helped pass more than 2,000 pieces of legislation across the country in 2024.

Holle said he initially ran for the Legislature in 2022 to advocate for family farms, small businesses and helping his community.
“In North Dakota’s future, I know that our greatest strength comes from working together, not against each other,” Holle said. “Too often, ideas are judged not on their merit, but on who proposed them and that is not leadership. That is not service and that is not what North Dakotans expect or deserve.”
Holle said the caucus wants to ensure the next generation of leaders is able to come together and facilitate the difficult conversations to find solutions.
Braunberger said he hopes the caucus brings people toward the ideological middle instead of the extreme-right or extreme-left.
“We are not always going to agree on every issue, but we’re going to come together on issues that we can,” Braunberger said. He added he believes the caucus will make lawmakers more productive by being able to have civil discourse with members of the opposing party.
Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, said she and Braunberger don’t agree on many issues, but the caucus gives them an avenue to talk productively.
“Not to say that I don’t do that with other lawmakers, but being able to do it with people in my generation is different,” Cory said. 
Even as a Republican in a conservative state like North Dakota, Cory said she has constituents who didn’t vote for her and she still needs to represent them.
She added she hopes the caucus will help her understand issues from a more well-rounded perspective so she can be a better representative for all of her constituents.

Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, speaks on the House floor about House Bill 2777, which would change some requirements for homeschooling in West Virginia. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The House of Delegates signed off on changes to homeschooling in West Virginia that included transferring oversight of thousands of homeschool students from local county boards of education to the state. 
House Bill 2777, sponsored by Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, a homeschool parent, does away with the state’s requirement that a homeschooling parent have a high school diploma. 
The bill also addresses what some lawmakers have said is a dangerous loophole in current homeschool laws by pausing a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent.
More than 30,000 children are homeschooled in West Virginia. 
Last year, former Gov. Jim Justice and some Republican lawmakers called for strengthening the state’s homeschool reporting requirements after 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller, who was being homeschooled, died from apparent starvation in Boone County. Her mother hadn’t turned in any required assessments to the local county school board. 
Data from the West Virginia Department of Education last year showed that only about a third of families homeschooling their children turned in the required assessments to show student progress. State law doesn’t require that public school employees follow up on homeschool families who have failed to report a child’s progress.
West Virginia has one of the nation’s highest rates of child abuse, and the state’s foster care system has been overburdened largely with abuse and neglect cases.
Del. Josh Holstein, R-Boone, said the bill “would resolve future cases like that while still protecting the rights of homeschoolers.” The bill doesn’t address missing assessments, but it would pause a homeschool request by a parent involved in a pending child abuse or neglect investigation. The request would have to be resolved within 10 days. 
“We had a situation in Boone County that really devastated our county … I’m going to be a ‘yes’ on it,” Holstein said Tuesday on the House floor. 
The measure is similar to a bill known as “Raylee’s Law” passed last year by the House; it’s named for an eight-year-old girl who died of abuse and neglect in 2018 after her parents withdrew her from school. Educators at her elementary school had notified Child Protective Services of potential abuse. 
The legislation was spearheaded by Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio.
“Through the years of work, we’ve come up with bipartisan language to be included in this legislation,” Fluharty said. “If there’s one thing we can agree on in the body, all 100 of us, it’s pulling the rope together to protect children.”
Crouse said that the state is prepared to take on oversight of homeschool children. A spokesperson for the West Virginia Department of Education said the superintendent is not available to comment on the bill because it is still going through the legislative process. 
Crouse has repeatedly raised concerns about local school boards losing paperwork, including a parent’s notice of intent to homeschool, and requirement assessments turned in by homeschool parents.
 “The county does not do a good job of it… they lose most of them,” Crouse said. 
House Finance Chair Vernon Criss, R-Wood, asked Crouse about a fiscal note, prepared by the WVDE, saying management of the state’s homeschoolers, including an online “school choice portal,” would cost $700,000. The fiscal note was not included on the state’s legislative website with the bill.
“I would believe they probably made one up,” Crouse responded.
The bill passed the House with a vote of 75-22. 
On Monday, Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, tried to amend the bill to remove the state’s requirement that parents or guardians of homeschool students are required to submit to the county superintendent academic assessments of the children at grade levels three, five, eight, and 11. The amendment was defeated with a vote of 36-59 after some lawmakers argued that the assessments were used to verify that children were learning at home. 
State would have to create ‘school choice portal’ without funding
The House also passed House Bill 3422, mandating that the state board of education oversee an online “school choice portal.” It would reduce the county’s workload and financial obligations, Crouse said.
“Half the time they lose the paperwork anyway,” she said. 
The school board would have to create the portal with input from individuals representing microschools, the Hope Scholarship and more.
Del. Lori Dittman, R-Braxton, voted against the measure, citing an unfunded mandate for the WVDE.
“This will be an unfunded mandate,” Dittman said. “This portal is a great idea, but it does come with a cost. And because it is unfunded and also with the current budget we have cut the education department by $11 million, I don’t think now is the time to do this portal.”
Crouse said she was told by the WVDE there would be no cost for them to operate the portal.
“I don’t foresee there being any,” she said. “I have numbers and figures here on how that would easily be taken care of,” she said.
Both bills will go to the Senate for consideration.

,DC,2025-04-01 22:40:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Dem states sue Trump administration over sudden cancellation of $11B in health funds,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dem-states-sue-trump-administration-over-sudden-cancellation-11b-health-funds,,"A coalition of Democratic state officials sued the Trump administration Tuesday over plans to cut more than $11 billion in grants by the Department of Health and Human Services, on the same day thousands of HHS workers reportedly found they’d been swept up in a mass layoff.In Washington, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee wrote HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asking him to appear before the panel and discuss his plans for the massive agency.The federal suit, signed by 22 attorneys general and two Democratic governors, alleges Kennedy revoked, without warning, billions in grant funding appropriated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, starting last week. That led to states scrambling to adjust plans for vaccination efforts, infectious disease prevention, mental health programs and more.The sudden and chaotic rollout of the grant cuts foreshadowed a scene at HHS offices, including at big campuses in Maryland, on Tuesday morning. Termination notices to laid-off workers were reportedly emailed early Tuesday, but many workers did not see them before arriving at the office and finding out they’d lost their jobs when their key cards did not work.Few specificsBoth the mass layoffs and the grant funding cuts challenged in the lawsuit stem from Kennedy’s March 27 announcement that the department would be “realigning,” by shuttering several offices and cutting 10,000 workers.It was unclear Tuesday exactly what offices or employees were affected.An HHS spokesperson responded to a request for comment by referring States Newsroom to Kennedy’s announcement, a press release and an accompanying fact sheet from March 27.None provided a detailed breakdown but laid out plans to eliminate 3,500 full-time positions at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,200 staff at the National Institutes of Health and 300 workers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up inquiry requesting more details of the positions eliminated and other clarifications.Efficiency doubtedIn a written statement, Andrés Arguello, a policy fellow at Groundwork Collective, a think tank focused on economic equity, said the cuts would have “the exact opposite” effect of the administration’s stated goal of government efficiency.“Gutting 10,000 public servants means higher costs, longer wait times, and fewer services for families already struggling with the rising cost of living,” Arguello, an HHS deputy secretary under former President Joe Biden, wrote. “Entire offices that support child care, energy assistance, and mental health treatment are being dismantled, leaving working families with fewer options and bigger bills. This isn’t streamlining—it’s abandonment, and the price will be paid by the sick, the vulnerable, and the poor.""The lack of communication led to confusion among advocates and state and local health workers about the impacts of the staff cuts and cast doubt about the administration’s goals, speakers on a Tuesday press call said.“There are so many more questions than answers right now,” Sharon Gilmartin, the executive director of Safe States Alliance, an anti-violence advocacy group, said. “They clearly are eliminating whole divisions and branches, which doesn't speak to bureaucratic streamlining. It speaks to moving forward an agenda, which has not been elucidated for the public health community, it's not been elucidated for the public.”While specific consequences of the cuts were not yet known, Gilmartin and others said they would be felt at the state and local level.“I think what we do know is that … when we're cutting these positions at the federal level, we are cutting work in states and communities,” Gilmartin said.Pain in the statesThe lawsuit from Democratic officials is full of details about the impacts of the loss of federal funding on state programs.The suit was brought in Rhode Island federal court by the attorneys general of Colorado, Rhode Island, California, Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.HHS revoked “more than half a billion dollars” of grants from Pennsylvania, the Democratic officials said, affecting more than 150 state employees and contracted staff. The grants funded work “to respond to and mitigate the spread of infectious disease across the Commonwealth” and mental health and substance abuse programs.In Nevada, “HHS abruptly terminated at least six grants” that had funded epidemiology and lab capacity, immunization access and mental health services, according to the suit.“These terminations led Nevada to immediately terminate 48 state employees and to order contractors working under these awards to immediately cease all activity,” the complaint reads. “The loss of funding will have substantial impacts on public health in Nevada.”The cutoff of $13 million in unobligated grants for local communities in Minnesota will mean the shuttering of clinics to provide vaccines for COVID-19, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza and other diseases, the suit said.“One local public health agency reported that it held 21 childhood vaccination clinics and provided approximately 1,400 vaccinations to children in 2024,” a paragraph in the complaint about Minnesota local vaccine clinics said. “It also held 87 general vaccination clinics in 2024. As a result of the termination of the … funds, it has immediately ceased all vaccination clinics for 2025.”The grant terminations also affected state plans already in the works.Rhode Island had received an extension from HHS for a grant with $13 million unspent, but that money was revoked last week.“Accordingly, the state public health department developed a workplan for its immunization program that included an April 2025 vaccination clinic for seniors, provided salaries for highly trained technicians to ensure that vaccine doses are stored and refrigerated correctly to prevent waste of vaccines purchased with other tax-payer dollars, planned computer system upgrades, and covered printing costs for communications about vaccine campaigns,” the suit said.Senators want RFK Jr. on the HillDemocrats on Capitol Hill issued a slew of statements opposing the cuts and warning of their effects.Republicans were more deferential to the administration, asking for patience as details of the cuts are revealed.But the letter from the top members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee also brought both sides together to write Kennedy asking him to testify before the committee to make those explanations plain.“The hearing will discuss your proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services,” the letter from Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy and Vermont independent Bernie Sanders said.In a written statement, Cassidy said the hearing would be an opportunity for Kennedy to inform the public about the reorganization.“The news coverage on the HHS reorg is being set by anonymous sources and opponents are setting the perceptions,” Cassidy said in a written statement. “In the confirmation process, RFK committed to coming before the committee on a quarterly basis. This will be a good opportunity for him to set the record straight and speak to the goals, structure and benefits of the proposed reorganization.”",,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is once again teaming up with his fellow Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration — this time over grants for post-pandemic health infrastructure that the feds abruptly cancelled last week.  
The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is co-led by Neronha and AGs Phil Weiser of Colorado, Rob Bonta of California, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, and Nick Brown of Washington. An additional 17 AGs — plus the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania — are listed as plaintiffs in the suit, which is aimed at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 
“The secretary and the president are dead wrong legally,” Neronha told reporters gathered at his offices on South Main Street in Providence. 
Under Kennedy’s leadership, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is overseen by HHS, ended $11.4 billion nationwide, including about $31 million in Rhode Island, in post-pandemic grants meant to build and maintain public health efforts that will help stave off future pandemics. That includes efforts like vaccination outreach and clinics, laboratory testing, and disease prevention and monitoring. 
Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) officials learned about the cuts last week. The grants, previously allocated but still unspent, had expiration dates ranging from May 2025 to July 2026, and supported programs relating to child immunization, epidemiology, and initiatives to strengthen community-based health efforts and lessen health disparities.  
Neronha acknowledged that this case was “not dissimilar” from the other multi-state cases his office has joined against the federal government. One example is the January lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget also filed in Rhode Island’s federal court and also led by Neronha — among the earliest examples of litigative resistance against the Trump administration’s avalanche of executive orders and agency directives.  
“T​​his administration has been replete with irrational decision making. This is just one context of it,”  Neronha said. 
But in this case, the endangered funds affect money on which “literally the health and safety of Rhode Islanders depend,” Neronha said.
HHS memo ‘defies common sense’ 
The CDC annulled the grants just a few weeks after the fifth anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic. To underline the importance of preventing future outbreaks of the same scale, Neronha painted a landscape for reporters: Providence in 2020, when the streets and bridges were empty, and the traffic basically nonexistent.
“I remember very vividly the absence of people on the highway, the absence of people in Providence,” Neronha recalled. “I remember getting my nose swabbed in parking garages in Providence, Rhode Island Hospital, and at the train station in Wickford so that I could come to work.” 
“The notion that we could shut down our way of life for so long because of a pandemic was unthinkable,” Neronha continued. “Yet it happened.” 
Standing by Neronha’s side at the press conference was Dr. Jerome “Jerry” Larkin, director of the health department. Larkin supplemented Neronha’s depiction of life under the pandemic with a more recent example.  
“In January, we actually had a very vivid illustration of how public health works,” Larkin said, recounting how an unvaccinated Rhode Island child travelled internationally, “to a part of the world where measles is common,” and returned with the highly contagious disease as a souvenir — a situation that could have turned catastrophic, if not for the health department’s efforts.  
“Their diagnosis was made in a timely fashion,” Larkin said. “Appropriate response was put in place by our healthcare providers, by the Department of Health, that person recovered. Nothing happened.”
Larkin told Rhode Island legislators last week at committee hearings that the HHS memo nullifying the remaining grant money was technical. On Tuesday, he told reporters the dismissal was more like nonsense: “It’s difficult to explain that which defies common sense.”
The lost grants constitute 21% of the state’s overall federal funding, Larkin said, which is comparable to the CDC money lost in other states — $81 million in Maine and $87 million in Massachusetts, the doctor offered as examples.
“It has been difficult since January 20 to answer any question related to this administration,” Larkin added.
Neronha said that Trump is pushing the executive branch in an “authoritarian” direction, by frequently ignoring the powers of Congress to allocate money. 
“The fundamental legal problem is what he’s doing directly contradicts what the Congress told the president to do, which is to spend this money,” Neronha said. “That’s for you. We pay our federal taxes…to the federal government so that they can protect us from things that we can’t protect ourselves from.”
The legal complaint, which is seeking an injunction against HHS according to the 45-page initial court filing, did not have a hearing date scheduled as of Tuesday evening.

Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday.
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-01 22:35:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate GOP aims for budget resolution vote this week,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-aims-budget-resolution-vote-week,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans hope to approve a budget resolution this week that would clear the way for Congress to enact an extension of expiring tax law as well as sweeping cuts to federal spending later this year.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday the chamber will likely vote on the House-passed budget resolution later this week, after completing the vote-a-rama, where lawmakers vote on dozens of amendments, typically into the early morning hours.“Republicans continue to have very productive conversations on how to achieve our agenda and working with President Trump on making sure that we are rebuilding our military, unleashing American energy dominance, making sure there isn’t a four-and-a-half trillion tax increase on the American people at the end of this year and obviously securing our border,” Thune said.The House and Senate must vote to adopt the same budget resolution with matching instructions before they can use the complicated reconciliation process to move legislation through Congress on their own. The process allows the majority party to avoid the Senate filibuster that requires 60 votes for most legislation.One ‘big, beautiful bill’GOP lawmakers in the two chambers have been at odds for months over whether to move their core legislative goals in two bills or one package.The Senate approved a budget resolution in mid-February that would have addressed the issue in two bills, before the House voted later that month to move forward with a different budget resolution.The final, adopted budget resolution would set up Republicans to hold floor votes on one “big, beautiful bill,” as President Donald Trump has described it, later this year, if GOP leaders can keep nearly all of their members on board with the final product.Republicans hold unified control of Congress and the White House, but voters didn’t give the party especially wide margins.The GOP holds 218 seats in the 435-member House amid absences, though it could pick up two more members following special elections in Florida on Tuesday. Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate.Any changes to tax law, energy policy or spending cuts will need support from nearly every GOP lawmaker in Congress, including centrists, who barely won election in swing districts, and far-right members, who are more likely to lose to a primary challenger claiming they’re not conservative enough.The House-passed resolution includes reconciliation instructions that would allow Congress later this year to extend the 2017 tax cuts and a range of other GOP policy priorities that could not survive the 60-vote threshold.Democratic amendmentsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that Democrats plan to put up amendments during budget debate that will showcase how the eventual bill could impact Americans.“We have had many good discussions, including today. And you are going to find us focused relentlessly on what … Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the Republican Senate and House are doing to the American people,” Schumer said. “They’re taking away benefits that they desperately need.”The Senate adopted just two amendments during its last vote-a-rama in February, one from Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan and one from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee.Democrats put forward numerous amendments but were unable to get any adopted.",,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

James Blanchard, a former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, slammed President Donald Trump's approach to foreign relations with the U.S.'s northern neighbor during the Detroit Regional Chamber's State of the Region presentation on April 1, 2025. | ScreenshotWhile the Detroit Regional Chamber celebrated a resilient economy, low unemployment and a prosperous business environment in the region, President Donald Trump’s trade policies cast a cloud over the state’s future as business and political leaders warned that a trade war with Canada could bring particular harm to metro Detroit. 
Arguing Canada has not done its part in combating the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States, Trump has levied a 25% additional tariff on goods from the nation’s northern neighbor, with a lower 10% tariff on energy resources from Canada.
Trump has also ordered a 25% tariff on all Canadian steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, which economists have said could reduce 2025 US auto sales by 700,000 vehicles.
Canada has responded by levying tariffs of its own on more than $30 billion in U.S. goods including orange juice, peanut butter, wine, spirits, beer, coffee, appliances and more. It has also imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. steel products, $3 billion in aluminum products, and $14.2 billion in additional goods including tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sport equipment and cast-iron products.
While the Canadian government has said all options are on the table should the U.S. continue to impose tariffs, Trump has labeled Wednesday, April 2, “Liberation Day” with plans to announce massive tariffs in an effort to fulfill his administration’s economic promises, although the details of his plans still remain unclear. 
Addressing members of the chamber and their guests on Tuesday, James Blanchard, a former Democratic governor of Michigan who served as the ambassador to Canada from 1993 to 1996, pointed to the benefits of the centuries-long alliance between the U.S. and its neighbor to the north, noting the two countries have held an integrated economy in the automotive, energy, agriculture and national security sectors for years. 
With many economists predicting a recession and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning a 25% tariff on autos would “blow a hole” in the U.S. auto industry, Blanchard warned further tariffs could bring serious harm to businesses and consumers. 

“I’m not an economist. I’m not an astrologist. All I know is Liberation Day could become Inflation Day if we don’t watch it. And that’s serious,” Blanchard said. 
From allying together in World War I and II, the Korean War and the War in Afghanistan, serving as founding members of the United Nations and NATO, as well as partners in NORAD, holding integrated economies and partnering on issues pertinent to the Great Lakes, Blanchard said there is “no good reason” to label Canada a national security threat or trade villain or to suggest it should become the 51st state, in reference to remarks from Trump suggesting Canada would be better off as part of the U.S.

Additionally, Blanchard claimed more migrants have been heading north into Canada than south into the U.S., challenging the President’s rationale for initiating a trade war with what has long been regarded as one of its closest allies.
According to the Canadian government, the country has experienced an influx of individuals crossing between official ports of entry, though it has not publicly released statistics on the number of irregular border crossings since the beginning of 2025.
Blanchard also noted that fentanyl coming from Canada represented less than 1% of fentanyl seizures nationwide.
The former ambassador later noted that Canada was the largest importer of American goods, pointing to energy imports as the cause of the U.S.’s trade deficit with Canada.
“We want that. Michigan uses that. We need that on any given day, natural gas which heats the homes and businesses in this town is probably natural gas from Canada, either shipped directly or back from Ontario,” Blanchard said, 
He once again challenged Trump, noting the country is already leading the globe in oil production, countering the president’s argument that the country is facing an energy crisis. 
Throughout his speech Blanchard called on Michiganders to show their appreciation for their friends and family members in Canada, pointing to the opening of the new Gordie Howe International Bridge between Detroit and Windsor planned for this Fall as an opportunity to celebrate the nation’s friendship.
“Let’s celebrate that as we move forward, and let’s make sure no one distorts the truth about how fabulous this relationship is,” he said. 
Tariffs carry heavy consequences for Michigan Business, Detroit Regional Chamber president warns
While the Detroit Regional Chamber’s 2025 State of the Region report showed strong economic growth, job growth, growth in commercial real estate market as well as strong activity in venture capital, the chamber’s President and CEO Sandy Baruah warned that region was particularly susceptible to the impacts of Trump’s trade policy, with its report noting that 234,000 jobs in the Detroit Region rely on trade and investment with Canada. 
“In just, you know, literally two or three months, we’ve seen one of the biggest drops in nationwide CEO confidence we’ve ever seen and Michigan is at a disproportionate risk with some of the changes that we are seeing potentially at the federal level, everything from changes in [electric vehicle] policy, electrification, infrastructure and certainly tariffs,” Baruah said.

“We’re an automotive state. Our supply chains are completely integrated. There is no other state in the nation that has a more integrated supply chain than with the nation of Canada, than Michigan, particularly around automotive and manufacturing,” Baruah said. 
While Blanchard highlighted the U.S.’s personal ties to Canada, Baruah further emphasized the economic ties, noting that one in eight residents of the Detroit Region workers hold ties to Canada in addition to 650 Canadian companies with major footprints in Michigan. 
According to a poll conducted by the Lansing-based Glengariff group in partnership with the Chamber, Baruah said nearly 70% of Michigan voters believed Canada is an economic friend of the U.S., while a majority understand that tariffs on Canadian goods will hurt Michigan’s economy. 
Economic and global threats of worsening relations with Canada
Following Baruah’s breakdown of the chamber’s economic report, lawyer and International Trade expert Aida Dismondy joined Blanchard and Baruah alongside Consul General of Canada in Detroit Colin Bird for a discussion moderated by Devin Scillian, a longtime journalist who retired from WDIV-TV 4 in December. 
The panelists severely criticized Trump’s actions against Canada, with Bird noting that 70% of exports from Canada into the U.S. are further input into manufacturing.

“What that speaks to is what we do in this region of highly integrated trade… that’s what makes it really valuable for me as a Canadian diplomat here in Michigan to know that this is not a Michigan policy. This is a made in Washington problem, and we need to be working together across this border to protect this region together,” Bird said. 
Dismondy echoed Blanchard’s earlier remarks about friends in Canada, noting that she had told her clients their suppliers are their best allies at the moment. 
“In a time when the federal government has let us down from a trade policy perspective, it is this time when going back to [the] Governor’s remarks, not only to just call our friends, but our business partners and come together as a united front, because it is through business partners that we will continue these relationships at a time when chaos and insecurity or uncertainty is looming large,” Dismondy said. 
On Friday, Baruah, alongside Glenn Stevens Jr., the executive director of MichAuto, which advocates for the state’s automotive and mobility sector, sent a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative and the state’s congressional delegation, asking them to continue a pause on applying tariffs to auto parts that comply with the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement and advising against levying tariffs on vehicles produced outside of Mexico and Canada as well as parts produced outside North America.

When asked to expand on this letter, Baruah told Scillian he could not see the end game of these policies. 
“When I talk to people who are close to the president, people who are in the administration, Republican members of Congress, etc, etc. And they kind of give us the talking points. They say ‘Well, you know, there’s going to be short term pain, you know, but it’s, you know, we’re going to bring, you know, we’re going to bring manufacturing back here,’” Baruah said. 
“Tell me how that’s going to happen in a political cycle, because, you know, best case scenario, it takes three, four years to build an automotive plant, it takes about that same amount of time, if you’re lucky, to build an aluminum plant, right? So how does, frankly, the Trump administration, from a political standpoint, withstand the unemployment that’s going to happen, the slowdown in the economy,” Baruah asked, warning that tariffs could lead to rising prices due to tariffs and high unemployment as industries slow down.
Bird later noted that the U.S.’s actions toward Canada had spurred the country into conversations with other trade partners as other countries also expect to face U.S. tariffs.

“How do we reimagine some trading arrangements that, frankly, we have not put enough effort into because this has been such an easy, effective relationship that we’ve had with the United States. So it’s forcing us to be more creative, and it’s uniting Canadians in a way that I’ve never seen, and makes me proud,” Bird said. 
Dismondy, Blanchard and Baruah further stressed the importance of allies as the U.S. works to protect itself from economic threats alongside threats to national security, focusing on Russia and China.

“The only way, given China’s frankly, very strong competitive advantages, to combat the Chinese economic and national security threats is to do it together,” Baruah said. 
However, there is some good news, Blanchard said, pointing to Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, who served as ambassador to the Netherlands under Trump’s first administration as well as a U.S. Representative from 1993 to 2011.
“He is eminently qualified to be ambassador to Canada or just about anywhere. He does have the ear of President Trump. I’ve spoken with him. I said, “You got a big job, but you’re up to it, Pete.’ So I think he will be helpful to a reasonable degree, and I think that’s good for Michigan and good for our country,” Blanchard said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A resolution to change North Dakota’s term limits law failed in the House on a narrow 46-43 vote Tuesday, but could be reconsidered on Wednesday after five people were absent during the vote.
The resolution received a majority of the votes in the chamber, but failed to cross the elected majority threshold of 48 votes to be passed.
Senate Resolution 4008, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, would allow lawmakers to serve four complete terms, a total of 16 years, in either chamber of the Legislature. It also clarifies a partial term of a lawmaker would not count against the term limit.
North Dakota voters in 2022 passed a measure that put term limits for state legislators into the North Dakota Constitution. Lawmakers are now limited to serving up to eight years in the House and up to eight years in the Senate.
On Monday, the House Government and Veterans Affairs Committee gave the resolution a do not pass recommendation on an 8-5 vote.
Changing term limits targeted in North Dakota Senate resolution

Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, urged lawmakers to reject the resolution.  
“I don’t know how we’re going to justify overrunning the will of the people,” VanWinkle said. “The power reserved to changing term limits is reserved to the initiative process.”
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said all the measure does is keep lawmakers in the same chamber without needing to change chambers after eight years.
“The senators don’t want to become representatives,” Vetter said. “That’s really what this bill is because that’s all it does.” 
Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, said he’s spoken with people who believed they were signing a petition and voting on term limits for members of the U.S. Congress in 2022, not the state Legislature.
“I think there’s a question on whether this was the will of the people,” Satrom said. “There was questions about many of the signatures. There was questions about how it was advertised and promoted … We shouldn’t be afraid to put this before the people.”
The resolution passed the Senate in March on a 24-23 vote.
If reconsidered and passed by the House, the resolution would be put to the voters during the 2026 general election.
Another term limit bill, House Bill 1300, passed the Senate on March 28, however the bill was amended and would need to be approved by committee chairs in the House or go to a conference committee between the chambers.
The amended House Bill 1300 clarifies the start date of the legislative term limits to begin with lawmakers elected after Jan. 1, 2023.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Disabled Pennsylvania veterans may get a boost in their pensions, under legislation in the Pennsylvania Senate. 
The proposal is one of five pieces of legislation advanced by the state Senate Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness on Tuesday.
Senate Bill 534 is sponsored by Sens. Judy Ward (R-Blair) and Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny).
“Under current law, Pennsylvania veterans who suffered service connected injuries or diseases that resulted in a loss of vision, paralysis or the loss of two or more extremities, are eligible to receive a pension of $150 per month,” Robinson said on Tuesday. “Senate Bill 534 would increase the pension amount from $150 to $180 per month for both programs.”
As of Nov. 30, 2024, Robinson said 98 people across Pennsylvania were in the blind veterans pension program, while 2,345 are in the amputee and paralyzed veterans pension program.
Robinson, a military veteran, said the two initiatives have not received any increase since 1999 and a similar effort in the previous session cleared the committee, but did not get passed by both chambers.
The bill was supported unanimously on Tuesday, although an effort from Democratic Sen. Katie Muth, Minority Chair of the committee, to add an amendment to establish an annual cost of living adjustment for both programs was tabled.
Boosting veteran owned businesses
Senate Bill 64, sponsored by state Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Washington), would create a special logo to be used for veteran owned businesses in the commonwealth.
According to the Senate Republican Communications Office, a business must be registered with the Department of State and at least 51% of the ownership interest must be held by a veteran, reservist or member of the National Guard to be eligible.

“They’re deserving of our support in any and every way we can possibly show it,” Bartolotta said. “And I think this is just a way to signal to the community that the owner of that business served our country and…if we prefer to support those kinds of businesses, this is a way that we can do it.”
Pennsylvania has the fourth largest veteran population in the nation.
In an effort to discourage the logo from being used for fraudulent purposes, those who falsely claim to be a veteran to get this designation would face a third degree misdemeanor, with fines associated with the violation awarded to the Veterans’ Trust Fund.

Ed Setzler pitches his RFRA bill at an April 1 press conference. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWith the 2025 legislative session set to expire at the end of the week, supporters of a controversial “religious freedom” bill gathered in the Capitol to call for its final passage.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler’s Senate Bill 36, also known as the ​​Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, has passed the Senate and a House committee. Passage through the full House would send it to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk.
“Every Georgian should be free to exercise their faith without unfair federal, state, and local government intrusion,” Setzler said. “Senate Bill 36, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, protects ordinary people from unfair state and local government intrusion by exactly mirroring the language from the federal RFRA law that protects people from unfair federal government intrusion.”
Setzler said 39 states have RFRA laws on the books and characterizes his bill as a way to protect religious liberties at the state and local level the same way the First Amendment protects them at the federal level. He gave the example of a Native American boy whose school tried to make him cut his long braided hair that was part of his religious and cultural heritage. Setzler said the boy’s family won a lawsuit under their state’s RFRA law.
Opponents say without statewide civil rights protections, a RFRA law would allow religious Georgians to discriminate against LGBTQ people or members of religious minorities.
  Rep. Esther Panitch. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
“Cloaked in religion, Georgians can deny thousands of people the ability to live the American dream,” said Atlanta Democratic Sen. RaShaun Kemp, who is gay, in a statement. “The truth is, these bills aren’t helping Georgians. That is why we fight them. Because we know bills like this don’t do anything but drive a wedge between neighbors, and harm minorities.”
Rep. Esther Panitch, a Sandy Springs Democrat and the state’s only currently-serving Jewish state legislator, took issue with Setzler when he said the bill would mostly protect minority religions rather than evangelical Christianity.
“That’s a lie,” she said. “Every time I try to stand up for asking for religious liberty for Jews and how it would be affected by a state RFRA, they essentially say that my religious liberties don’t matter.”
“For example, in Judaism, life does not begin at conception,” she said. “Just look at Israel. (Abortion) is legal and it’s accessible, the Jewish state, but if I need one, I can’t get one. And so in this state, my religious liberties are being degraded in favor of a Christian majority.”
Panitch pointed to Indiana, where the state court of appeals ruled that the right to an abortion can be protected under that state’s RFRA law.
“RFRA is now being used in Indiana to create religious exemptions for Jewish women, so on some level, if it passes no matter my objections, I’m going to really enjoy when RFRA gets used to invalidate the heartbeat bill.”
Panitch was referencing Georgia’s abortion law, sponsored by Setzler in 2019 when he was in the state House.
  Cole Muzio. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Panitch said she had asked House leadership not to let the bill come to the floor, but influential conservatives are putting pressure on the House to move forward on RFRA.
Cole Muzio, head of the evangelical Frontline lobbying firm, gave lawmakers a not-so-subtle message at Setzler’s rally.
“As we look ahead to next year, whether it’s primary season or general election season, we have long memories and we have expectations, and we expect this to be done now,” he said.
Similar bills have fallen short in the Georgia Legislature in recent years, but Setzler said he is confident the House will vote on and pass SB 36 this year.
“I would welcome a large bipartisan vote, but I know we’ve got the votes on the floor of the House to do this, it’s just a matter of making the decision that we need to do it this year,” he said. “I thank the leadership that’s deliberating on this carefully, they’re friends of mine, they believe in this deeply. It’s a matter of timing. I think it’s important to recognize that timing, respectfully, is now.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Immigrant rights and religious advocates at a Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday said legislation establishing a new crime for the act of human smuggling could penalize people working with undocumented communities.
The measure, House File 572, would establish human smuggling as a criminal offense, including acts of transporting a person in violation of federal immigration laws with the intent to conceal them from law enforcement, encouraging or coercing a person to enter or stay in the U.S. against the law by concealing or harboring them, and directing multiple individuals to be on agricultural lands without the landowner’s consent.
The crime would be charged as a Class C felony. A higher charge of a Class B felony would be brought in some cases, such as when the crime is committed for monetary gain, if the victim is put in danger of serious bodily injury or death, or if the case involves minors.
A Class A felony charge would apply for situations where the victim is sexually abused and in cases where the crime results in the victim suffering serious bodily injury or death.
While advocates said no one is in support of smuggling, they said the bill could lead to people who work with immigrant communities being charged with “smuggling” crimes — and that Latino Iowans engaged in this work could be targeted by law enforcement.
Elizabeth Balcarcel, a member of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, an immigrant rights organization, said that there are already federal laws in place to address human trafficking, and that creating this new offense would not help victims in Iowa.
“These new state-level criminal offenses would just lead to increased targeting of immigrants and their allies in our state, increased fear in immigrant communities, and additional cost to the taxpayers,” Balcarcel said. “If we want to protect victims of human trafficking, we should direct those resources to centers that provide direct services to victims and to fix the immigration system.”
Multiple speakers with churches and religious organizations said their work — and their religious freedom to provide assistance to undocumented people — could also be impacted by the bill. Tom Chapman with the Iowa Catholic Conference said though Catholic teachings recognize the right of a country to maintain its borders, their religious practice also teaches providing help and services to newcomers, which could be penalized under the bill.
“Does ‘encourage or induce a person to remain in the U.S.’ mean providing food or shelter to an immigrant?” Chapman said. “We don’t want to get into a situation, as we have seen in at least one other state, where authorities, based on a similar bill, are trying to shut down some Catholic ministries that are helping migrants with basic needs.”
In Texas, a Catholic shelter network, Annunciation House, the state attorney general alleged the nonprofit had violated a similar anti-smuggling law in 2024 for its efforts to help people suspected of being undocumented immigrants.
But Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, argued that the bill will not have the effects that some advocates describe. He said some speakers were describing a 2024 bill that was passed by the Iowa House but did not survive in the Senate and which had much broader implications for groups serving immigrant communities.
Webster said the 2025 legislation was much more “narrowly tailored” to address actual labor, sex and human traffickers, pointing to the fact that individuals must “knowingly” commit these crimes.
“This bill is much more tailored than last year’s, where, essentially, if you put them — put somebody in a car and you didn’t know their immigration status, you could have been thrown in jail,” Webster said. “This one is much more narrow to somebody trying to smuggle somebody who knows that they’re illegal, and they broke those laws — not that they’re undocumented, but that they’re actually (illegally in the country.)”
Lucas Asbury, an attorney with Iowa MMJ, said if “the concern really is to support victims … then what we need to do is we need to create protections for them.”
“We need to get ways for them to come forward and talk to the police, rather than creating this myriad of fear which is going to create a chilling effect,” Asbury said. “It’s going to make law enforcement’s job harder, because they won’t be able to go into these communities. They will be distrusted, disliked, and no one here wants that.”
Though many speakers Tuesday said the bill would negatively impact immigrant communities, Sen. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola, said the measure is meant to provide protections to such groups.
“I want to re-emphasize this bill is aimed at the smugglers, the people that are taking advantage of the immigrants,” Garrett said. “This bill is not aimed at the immigrants.”
The bill came before the Senate subcommittee after passing the Iowa House 75-14 in March. During floor debate in the House, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said the measure was needed to address situations occurring in Iowa, such as the alleged human trafficking of six Guatemalan nationals at Centrum Valley Farms who claimed the company denied them overtime pay and threatened them with deportation.
Labor advocate groups said the measure would not necessarily help law enforcement stop labor trafficking in the state. Peter Hird with the Iowa Federation of Labor said a labor trafficker “isn’t likely the person who’s driving the van of workers, it’s the larger entity who’s financing the entire operation.”
Felicia Hilton with the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters said measures that would increase enforcement worker compensation laws and other labor protections would more effectively uncover and penalize labor traffickers in Iowa.
The bill moved forward with support from Webster and Garrett. Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines, did not sign off on the bill.
Webster told advocates he was open to amendments to the bill, but that he supported enacting harsher punishments for people committing these crimes.
“Instead of sitting back looking at this and saying, ‘Don’t do this bill,’ figure out ways to get this to actually (target) smuggling if you’re concerned about the situations,” Webster said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/smugglingsub4.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

The defense for Jennifer Crumbley, who a jury determined held some responsibility for the four students her son murdered in a school shooting on Nov. 30, 2021, has been appealing her conviction, arguing that McDonald violated constitutional, legal, and ethical duties throughout the case.
  Jennifer Crumbley speaks before she is sentenced on involuntary manslaughter charges in Oakland County Circuit Court on April 9, 2024. (Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)
Michael Dezsi, the attorney representing Crumbley, has argued that McDonald and her office have engaged in a “smear campaign” against Crumbley, paying more than $100,000 towards public relations firms to sway the court of public opinion and the jurors. Additionally, Dezsi has reasoned that the prosecution’s use of proffer agreements for two school employees who testified in Crumbley’s case, were kept from the defense and jury and would have potentially had an impact on Crumbley’s defense strategy.
Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews decision to reject the defense’s request to remove and disqualify the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office from Crumbley’s case fails to right the wrongs of the case which was “off the rails from the beginning” Dezsi said in a statement Tuesday.
“In the face of such mounting evidence surrounding the prosecutor’s misconduct and mishandling of the case, the trial court denied Mrs. Crumbley’s motion to remove the prosecutor finding that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear such motion,” Dezsi said. “I strongly disagree with the court’s decision that it doesn’t have jurisdiction to hear the evidence of the prosecutor’s misconduct, and I will take the issue up to the Michigan Court of Appeals to review today’s decision from the trial court.”
Jennifer Crumbley found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Oxford High School shooting

Matthews reasoned in her decision that she does not have the jurisdiction to remove a prosecutor from a case at the circuit court level and that is an issue for an appeals court. Furthermore, the motion to remove the prosecutor to the circuit court is “at its heart…a collateral attack” on Crumbley’s conviction as it seeks to raise issues that would be considered by the appeals court.
Finding the motion for removal of the prosecutor duplicative with the request for a retrial, raising the same issues, Matthews ordered sanctions on Crumbley’s defense.
“This duplication creates unnecessary overlap and redundancy. The Court finds that the Motion was filed for an improper purpose and is not warranted by existing law,” Matthews wrote. “…a sanction for the violation will be reflected in the Court’s decision to approve reimbursement of appellate counsel fees with regard to the time spent preparing and filing the motion.”
McDonald has said the defense’s mischaracterization of prosecution of her case is an “irresponsible abuse of the court system” to attack common practice actions taken by her office in a case which was unprecedented.

McDonald’s office has repeatedly said the proffer agreements for Shawn Hopkins, who was a school counselor at Oxford High School, where the shooting took place and Nick Ejak, the former dean of students at the school, did not offer any promises of immunity to future prosecutions. Further, the funds that paid for the public relations firms to perform crisis communication were provided and approved by elected leaders of Oakland County and the firms’ hirings were very public matters, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Marc A. Keast said in a previous brief.
Crumbley, along with her husband, is currently serving a 10 to 15 year prison sentence for her role in the killings of Oxford High School students Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Justin Shilling, 17, and Madisyn Baldwin, 17 who were gunned down by her then 15-year-old son who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in December of 2023.
The Tuesday ruling underscores the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office’s commitment to fighting for justice for the Oxford community, McDonald said in a statement following the ruling.
“The court showed it has no tolerance for the defense’s misuse of the legal process, and they have been appropriately sanctioned,” McDonald said. “Let’s be clear about what this case is really about: If not for Jennifer Crumbley’s actions, Madisyn, Tate, Hana, and Justin would still be here. I will never stop fighting for them.”

(Photo by Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Utahns who are enrolled in Medicaid and are at least 21 years old are now eligible for dental care, Utah health officials announced on Tuesday.
Up until now, only certain groups of Utahns enrolled in Medicaid have been eligible for dental coverage, including children, pregnant women, adults undergoing treatment for substance use disorder, people who are blind and disabled, and adults that are 65 or older. 
However, Utah’s coverage expanded through the 1115 Demonstration Waiver approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) earlier this year, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services announced in a news release. 
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

 
The new coverage was announced as Utah became the first state in the nation to ban adding fluoride to public drinking water. The bill, HB81, takes effect May 7. 
An estimated 120,000 adult Utahns enrolled in Medicaid will now have access to dental services that may include check ups, X-rays, cleanings every six months, fillings, root canals, extractions, dentures, emergency exams for severe pain, and crowns, according to state health officials. 
The new coverage will be made possible through a partnership between Utah Medicaid and the University of Utah School of Dentistry (UUSOD), which will administer and provide the care. 
“After leveraging its own resources, UUSOD has stepped in to bridge a gap with the collective goal of providing high quality dental care for adults on Medicaid, ” Jen Strohecker, director of Utah Medicaid, said in a prepared statement.  “We are grateful for this strong and strategic partnership rooted in our commitment to care for all members of our community.”
The U.’s School of Dentistry has a network of more than 300 dentists in offices across the state. It also has dental providers that work at school clinics, rural clinics, and a mobile clinic van that travels to underserved areas. 
Utah health officials also noted that the U.’s dentist school’s provider network was “established after identifying populations who experience barriers in accessing dental care and services as a resource for the dental profession in Utah — while not competing for patients in the private sector.” 
Dentists enrolled in the U.’s network are offered a reimbursement incentive in addition to Medicaid reimbursement rates, as well as free continuing education courses, according to state health officials. They encouraged dentists who are interested in joining the network to learn more about the program on the U.’s website and apply.  
“The process is streamlined, the compensations are better,” said James Bekker, associate dean of professional, community and strategic relations at UUSOD. “Utah Medicaid is not your mother’s Medicaid. This is different.”
Utahns enrolled in medicaid can also choose a dentist by browsing the Medicaid website or call 1-866-608-9422.

(Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation)It’s getting down to crunch time for Pennsylvanians to get their REAL ID card.
As the May 7 deadline for REAL ID approaches, state Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Secretary Mike Carroll provided an update on Tuesday about the process.
“Starting May 7, if you don’t have a Real ID or a passport, then you’re not going to be able to board a commercial flight anywhere in Pennsylvania,” Carroll said on Tuesday.
Next month, the federal law mandating a REAL ID card or driver’s license goes into effect. Not only will it be needed for domestic flights, but also to enter a federal building or military installation, following the May 7 deadline.
Carroll said a REAL ID care will have a gold star in the corner of the ID.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At this point, about 26%, or about 2.5 million drivers in the state, have already secured their cards or licenses.
The REAL ID is optional for Pennsylvanians, if they have a passport. Without either one, a person will not be able to board a commercial flight in the state following the deadline, even if a ticket was purchased prior to May 7.
So a little more than a month before the deadline, Carroll issued a warning about the current wait times for people waiting until the last minute.
“There’s a lot of procrastinators out there and our driver’s license centers now have real serious issues with respect to a lot of folks showing up, even before the driver center opens,” Carroll said. “We’ll do our best to get you in and out of there quickly. And I’m hopeful that folks that don’t have to go to the driver’s license center that can take advantage of renewals online or via the mail, will take that opportunity.”
Carroll said PennDOT is “being aggressive with respect to opening driver’s license centers on Mondays, when we’re traditionally closed.”
“But 57 driver’s licenses across the state will be open on Mondays through April and the first Monday in May,” Carroll said, with the exception of Easter Monday, April 21, when the centers will be closed.

PennDOT’s website lists which ones will be open those extra days.
“I hope that people take advantage of this opportunity,” Carroll said.
He said the PennDOT website provides a checklist of the documents needed to bring with you to acquire the REAL ID, including if you had a name change during your life.
When acquiring a REAL ID, you’re also renewing your driver’s license at the same time, which means it costs $30 and the renewal fee.
“So, you’ll renew your driver’s license, you’ll pay the $30 for the REAL ID in addition to your renewal fee, and then we add four years to your current license,” Carroll said. “So, you could have a scenario where you have a license that’s good for seven or even eight years, depending on when you re-newed.”
“So you don’t lose time on the current license that you have,” he added. “We simply add four years to the license time that you’ve already paid for.”
A Pennsylvanian can acquire a REAL ID after the deadline, but would not be able to fly commercially without the ID or passport.
In an effort to get the word out, Carroll said they have done events in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with similar ones planned in Allentown, Erie, and Scranton leading up to the May 7 deadline.
“A lot of folks wait to the last minute, but that last minute is now,” Carroll said. “We’re about a month away from the deadline here.”
Tuesday’s update from Carroll is the first in a series of virtual events that will be held regularly in the weeks leading up to the start of the federal enforcement date.

Ohio House Republicans have announced their version of the state budget, dramatically slashing K-12 public school funding after months of uncertainty.
After facing questions about school funding for months, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, and Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, decided not to fully fund public schools in their proposed amendment to the H.B. 96 budget.



To be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need $666 million. The proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
Based on 2025 numbers and inflation, the amount of money to fund K-12 would be closer to $800 million, new data from public school advocates like former lawmaker John Patterson explained.
In a press conference Tuesday, the Republican leaders gave an overview of their substitute bill. Reporters were not given the legislation beforehand, nor did we get it during the event, so questions were based on what the lawmakers said without specifics.
In January, Huffman had threatened to cut public education spending, saying the state doesn’t have the budget for it and the amount for schools they were promised this year is “unsustainable.” Instead, they cut $351 million.
This comes as Gov. Mike DeWine fully funded public education in his version of the budget.
When proposed by the governor, he projected the budget would be $108 billion for fiscal year 2026 and $110 billion for fiscal year 2027 — $218 billion total.
The GOP legislators’ proposal isn’t final — but it likely won’t change dramatically before it passes out of the House and into the Senate next week.

Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able.""","Sen. Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able."" (John Partipilo)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday. 
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said. 
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-01 21:37:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Consumers, business owners hold their breath waiting for the Trump tariffs",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/consumers-business-owners-hold-their-breath-waiting-trump-tariffs,,"WASHINGTON — American business owners and consumers are bracing as President Donald Trump teases, with few details, the announcement of sweeping tariffs expected Wednesday afternoon.Trump has dubbed April 2 “Liberation Day,” his self-imposed deadline to fulfill his campaign promise of taxing imported products from around the globe.The White House confirmed Tuesday that Trump had made a decision on tariff levels but would not provide further details.“He's with his trade and tariff team right now perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker, and you will all find out in about 24 hours from now,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday afternoon at the daily briefing.The new tariffs come as Trump already imposed 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum, as well as 25% levies on foreign cars and vehicle parts set to begin Thursday.But the anticipation of more tariffs on numerous imported goods has stopped business owners in their tracks as uncertainty about costs and consumer reaction clouds day-to-day decisions.Stockpiling coffee cupsGabe Hagen, owner of Brick Road Coffee in Tempe, Arizona, said small business owners are feeling “whiplash.”“Are we going to have a tariff? Are we not? It's not easy for me to change my prices overnight. But at the same time, if all of the sudden I have my cost of goods going up, it'll put me into a loss territory.”Most disposable beverage cups are produced in China, so Hagen made the decision last year to purchase and store $26,000 worth of coffee cups in anticipation of tariffs.He also had to pull back $50,000 in capital for development on a second shop location, he said.“The main thing we're asking for is stability,” said Hagen, who also sits on the Small Business for America’s Future advisory council.Walt Rowen, owner and president of Susquehanna Glass Company in Columbia, Pennsylvania, said “there’s no clarity at this point at all.”“Everybody is in a holding pattern. We’re stuck wondering what is going to happen,” Rowen said. “We can sort of know that we're gonna have to increase prices if the tariffs come into effect. But what we don't know is if we increase prices, how much does that affect demand?”Rowen’s historic 1925 three-story production facility right in the middle of the southeastern Pennsylvania town employs anywhere from 35 to 65 workers, depending on the season.Through a variety of decorating techniques, his employees engrave or imprint screened paint logos, names and other messages on wine glasses he sources from a manufacturer in Italy and mugs made in Vietnam.Rowen’s production rooms buzz, especially in the months leading up to the holidays, when his employees laser engrave and hand paint personalized ornaments sourced from China for the Lenox Corporation.“My Christmas ornament business is huge for us in the fourth quarter, and I would normally be planning to bring in 20 to 30 people to work in that category of business. But if those prices increase by 30, 40, 50%, I don't know how many we're going to sell this year. So I can't even plan production. It’s frightening,” he said.States to feel economic painEconomists are warning the rollercoaster tariff policy coming from the Oval Office is undermining economic growth and trust in the U.S. as a stable trading partner.Trump told reporters as recently as Sunday that he was planning to slap tariffs on “all countries.”His administration’s mid-March levies on aluminum and steel imports sparked retaliation from the European Union and Canada, which beginning in mid-April will enforce taxes on hundreds of American products crossing their borders, including iconic Kentucky bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.Unless Trump carves out exceptions on certain products, more states can expect to feel economic pain, said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“For example, a state like Washington state is very export dependent, not just obviously aircraft, but also apples and a wide variety of other manufacturing and agricultural (products). That state will be really hard hit if there are retaliatory tariffs, both from Canada, which is a market, but also from Asia,” Lovely said.Trump’s tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico could cost the typical American family at least an extra $1,200 annually in price increases, according to a report Lovely co-authored. The dollar amount increases when calculating for universal tariffs on all imported goods, and when accounting for retaliation from other countries.European Union President Ursula von der Leyen already made clear in a speech Monday that the bloc wants to negotiate with Trump but will apply more levies on American products given no other choice.“Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but we have a strong plan to retaliate if necessary,” she said.Tariffs on CanadaOn Capitol Hill, Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced a resolution to block the president's tariffs on Canada, which he triggered under his emergency powers.Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Power Act to slap 25% tariffs on products out of Canada and Mexico marked the first time a president had ever done so.  “We think that the economic chaos that's being caused and markets being roiled and consumer confidence dropping, and some predicting recession, together with a bipartisan vote might convince the White House — ‘Hey, look, there's a better way to treat American citizens and customers,’” Kaine told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol Tuesday.Kaine said his message to Republicans is “stand up for your constituents and say no tax increase on them.”The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation late Tuesday or Wednesday.Bill Butcher, founder of Port City Brewing in Alexandria, Virginia, spoke alongside the senators Tuesday, expressing concern about the price of Canadian Pilsner malt that he’s used for 14 years.“It's a very specific strain of high quality barley that grows in the cold climate of Canada, and there's not a suitable U.S. substitute that we can get at the same quality to make our beer,” he said. “If there's a 25% tariff on this basic ingredient, it's going to slow our business down.“By the time it goes from us to our distributor to the retailer to the consumer, this $12.99 six-pack of beer is going to end up at $18.99. How many people are still going to want to buy a six-pack of great-tasting beer but at $18.99? People are going to start looking for a different substitute,” Butcher said.White House defends tariffsIn an emailed statement Tuesday to States Newsroom, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Trump used tariffs “to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he’s set to restore American Greatness in his second term.”“Fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump’s America First economic agenda isn’t going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America, and that countries ranging from Vietnam to India to the UK have already begun to offer up trade concessions that would help level the playing field for American industries and workers,” Desai said.Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor on trade, told “Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream” Trump’s new tariffs will raise $600 billion a year for the U.S., plus another $100 billion from the 25% duty on foreign cars that will launch this week.The government would gain that revenue from U.S. businesses who will need to pay the duty rates to get their purchased goods through the U.S. border.Erica York with the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Tuesday that number is “very, very wrong” because Navarro is basing the math on the current level of imports.“If we put a 20% tax on imports, people are not going to buy as many imports, so that reduces how much revenue you get,” York said. “Also, mechanically, if firms are making all of these tariff payments, that reduces their revenue. They don't have as much to pay workers (and) to return to shareholders.”U.S. stocks showed their biggest losses since 2022, according to Monday’s report on the first quarter of 2025.Both Moody’s Analytics and Goldman Sachs warned on Monday that they’ve raised their forecasts for an economic recession to 35%.",,,,2025-04-01 18:03:00.579164

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A ballot question committee is suing South Dakota’s top election official over a new law that shortens the window for petition circulation by three months.
Dakotans for Health filed the lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against Secretary of State Monae Johnson.
“This new law is just another effort to silence the voices of South Dakotans and deny them the right to make decisions that impact their lives,” said Dakotans for Health Chairman Rick Weiland in a news release.


Legislation affecting voters
Read more about election bills considered and adopted during the legislative session on South Dakota Searchlight’s 2025 Election Legislation page.


South Dakota’s Republican-dominated Legislature approved the legislation earlier this month, and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed it into law last week. The law moves the filing deadline up from May to February for petitions seeking to place citizen-initiated questions on the ballot during general election years.
“It also imposes additional challenges,” Dakotans for Health said, “including harsher winter conditions and decreased voter interest due to the far-removed election date.”
Dakotans for Health is seeking a court order blocking the enforcement of the law, and the payment of its attorney fees and costs.
The law affects initiated measures, which need petition signatures from 17,508 registered South Dakota voters to make the ballot, and initiated constitutional amendments, which need 35,017 signatures. State law says no signatures may be collected more than 24 months preceding the general election.
Dakotans for Health has been active in numerous petition drives, including two last year: a constitutional amendment that would have reinstated abortion rights and an initiated measure that would have repealed the state sales tax on groceries. Voters rejected both measures.
The main sponsor of the new law, House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, helped lead a legal challenge last year against the abortion amendment. The case was scheduled for trial after the election, but the lawsuit was dismissed after voters defeated the amendment.
Hansen sent a statement in response to a message Tuesday from South Dakota Searchlight.
“Disputes over the validity of petition signatures should be decided before the election takes place — not after,” the statement said. “Amending this deadline is a common sense way to give voters the certainty to know exactly what will be on their ballot before they go to vote while still allowing over a year to gather petition signatures.”
Hansen’s legislation was one of numerous bills legislators considered to restrict citizen lawmaking. Among those that passed was a resolution that will send a question to the 2026 ballot asking voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendment ballot questions from a simple majority to 60%. Lawmakers also passed but failed to override Gov. Rhoden’s veto of a bill that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from every legislative Senate district in the state.

Republicans on the House Health Committee voted in favor of House Bill 491, which its sponsor, Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) described as a signal to Washington decisionmakers that state legislators support work requirements. Nearly all Democrats on the committee voted no. Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) abstained. 
Rep. Garland Pierce (D-Scotland) said after the committee meeting the bill wasn’t “fully vetted.” 
Rep. Becky Carney (D-Mecklenburg) said the bill “wasn’t ready for prime time,” though Lambeth “did what he thought was right.”
North Carolina’s 2023 Medicaid expansion law already includes a provision requiring the state Department of Health and Human Services to pursue work requirements if it seems federal administrators will allow them. The federal government sets baseline requirements for Medicaid coverage and pays most of the bill. States must ask permission before changing their Medicaid programs.
  NC Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Under President Donald Trump’s first administration, state requests to impose Medicaid work requirements were approved. Courts overturned some of those approvals and President Joe Biden’s administration later rescinded others. 
Congressional budget-cutters are now considering work requirements as a way to save money in the Medicaid program. Along with work requirements and other cuts, Congressional Republicans are also considering a reduction in the 90% in funding support the federal government currently provides to states for people covered under Medicaid expansion.
North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion law includes a trigger that would end Medicaid expansion, which would withdraw health insurance from more than 600,000 people, if the federal government’s support falls below 90%. None of the money for people insured under Medicaid expansion comes from state coffers. 
Lambeth’s bill requires the state Department of Health and Human Services to tell the legislature how much money is needed to implement a work requirement and says it would be imposed regardless of another state law on income thresholds and eligibility categories. 
“It basically reiterates what the current expansion bill already says, signaling to the folks in Washington we’d be supportive of that if we got to that point,” Lambeth told the committee. 
“I’m hoping by signaling we’re okay with a work requirement, they will get off the idea of changing our funding formula. If the funding formula is changed, even a small tenth of a percent, one percent, it is a major impact to North Carolina, and we hope we don’t have to go down that path.” Lambeth has stated previously that a reduction in federal support would be “a disaster.”
Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) co-sponsored a bill that would get rid of the trigger. Under that bill, Medicaid expansion in North Carolina would be spared if the federal government’s financial support falls below 90%.
Crawford voted against the work requirement bill.
 A failed experiment in other states 
  Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“There is no evidence that work requirements actually increase work participation,” Crawford said after the committee meeting. Most adults who use Medicaid as their insurance and are able to work already do. “About eight percent of people on Medicaid who are able to work are not working, so it’s a relatively small number of people. Those individuals typically have a number of barriers to employment that include a whole host of things — where they live, their health, access to transportation. All that we’ve seen in the past, when other states have tried to implement work requirements, it actually leads to be people being left without coverage.”
Arkansas imposed a Medicaid work requirement for less than a year in 2018 before a judge ended it. About 18,000 people lost their health insurance, according to a study, and the work requirement did not lead to increased employment. Arkansans were not able to report their work hours due to lack of internet access, didn’t know about the requirement, or didn’t think it applied to them, a 2019 study said.
Stateline reported Tuesday that between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage under an emerging congressional Republican plan to impose Medicaid work requirements nationwide.
 A necessity to gain Republican support
Lambeth said after the meeting that the work requirement would cover people who gained insurance under Medicaid expansion. In that case, people with disabilities who are insured under special Medicaid programs would be exempt. 
Lambeth worked for years to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults, and for a long time he was one of the few Republicans in the legislature openly supporting it. He sponsored bills that were precursors to the 2023 Medicaid expansion law that included work requirements. 
Including the requirement for at least 90% federal funding in the 2023 expansion law was one of the conditions for winning greater Republican support, he said. 
“The only way we got that bill approved was to have triggers in there,” Lambeth said. The 90% trigger and work requirements were necessary to “cobble together enough Republican votes.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Medicaid-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 18:03:00.579164

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is looking into a fight at the maximum security wing of the state prison in Sioux Falls that broke out less than 48 hours before a planned tour of the building by a 22-member prison work group.
It’s unclear how many people were involved, how long the fighting took place before being brought under control, or how badly anyone was hurt. 
Staff “contained” the fight, and no one’s life is in danger as a result of their injuries, the Department of Corrections said. 
“That incident is under investigation. DCI has been notified of the fight,” spokesman Michael Winder wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.
Work group aims to ditch baggage, find solutions in prison talks

The Project Prison Reset work group is set to convene at 8 a.m. Wednesday for tours of the South Dakota State Penitentiary and Jameson Annex. It’s the first portion of a two-day meeting that also includes public presentations and public comments on Thursday at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls.
The group’s mission is to find consensus on whether the state needs new prison facilities. Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed lawmakers, law enforcement representatives, a judge and other stakeholders to the group in late February, after the Legislature shot down an attempt to finalize funding for a proposed 1,500-bed men’s prison in Lincoln County. Had it been approved, the $825 million prison campus would have been the most expensive taxpayer-funded building project in state history. It was meant to largely replace the penitentiary, a pre-statehood complex built in 1881.
The work group will tour the Lincoln County site, located 14 miles south of Sioux Falls, at 2 p.m. Wednesday.
Details unclear in Monday violence
The Monday fighting broke out in the Jameson Annex, a building erected in 1993 that was home to 473 inmates as of Feb. 28. In addition to housing the state’s highest-security inmates, Jameson has the Sioux Falls prison complex’s administrative segregation and mental health units and intake unit. All men admitted to the DOC for any level of crime spend time in the intake “fish tank” to be assessed before being assigned a cell in one of the state’s various housing facilities. 
Wealth of controversies, outbreaks of violence spark questions on prison oversight

The Jameson Annex remains on lockdown status after the fight, Winder said Tuesday. He did not say if any correctional officers were among the injured, if any of the injured were transported to the hospital for care, or note which area or areas of the facility where the fight occurred. 
Winder did not say if the ongoing investigation would keep members of the prison task force out of the building, and did not immediately respond to follow-up questions on the matter.
Tony Mangan, spokesman for the Division of Criminal Investigation, said the agency will work to determine the number of people involved and how the incident began. 
“The investigation is ongoing,” Mangan said.
Attorney General Marty Jackley, who oversees the DCI, is a member of the prison work group, but he won’t be on hand for its first meeting. He’s in Pierre this week for the trial of Lonna Carroll, a former Department of Social Services employee accused of embezzling from the state. 
Recent history of security trouble
The state’s prison system has struggled with a host of security incidents since March of 2024. Two days of unrest broke out at the penitentiary following the temporary shutdown of tablet-based inmate communications with family members that month. One correctional officer was injured in the first of those incidents.
A few months later, fighting broke out at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, which required outside medical care for some inmate victims. Prisoners called out to reporters the following day to express their worries of further violence.
Near the end of the summer, the DOC announced an indefinite lockdown at the penitentiary for what turned out to be a weekslong lockdown in search of contraband. Officers dismantled the campus sweat lodges during the search. After the lockdown ended, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko showed lawmakers images of knives fashioned from nail files and Plexiglas, a tattoo gun, mobile Wi-Fi hotspots and bags of homemade alcohol.
During debate on the Lincoln County prison proposal, last year and this year, Wasko argued that the penitentiary is unsafe and unsuited for continued use as offender housing.

His call to action comes after U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon notified state education departments on March 28 that they no longer had another year, as expected, to spend COVID funds and that the U.S. Education Department (USED) was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in COVID-relief fund reimbursements.
McMahon said the Education Department would consider extending the deadline for spending the money on “an individual project-specific basis.”

Fletcher wrote in his Tuesday letter that after the federal department changed how states could request COVID relief funds in February, the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) “has not received COVID grant funding the next business day as was previously the case” and was paying “district grant recipients and asking the federal government to reimburse us.” 
“At this point in time, we have asked to be reimbursed for nearly $5 million, with no response from USED,” Fletcher said. 
“This latest message from USED will harm a variety of our schools and districts across the state even more. KDE and/or our school districts have already committed or spent these funds because we were promised a liquidation period ending March 2026.”
Fletcher said 19 districts asked for an extension to fully spend their COVID relief dollars totaling $84.1 million. Thirteen districts have $34 million remaining “that should be accessible to spend for the benefit of students, primarily on construction projects or bus purchases” before the original deadline of March 2026.
Shortening the fund liquidation date by a year “leaves our districts and KDE in a difficult position,” Fletcher said. 
Some of the projects that are now in jeopardy include providing educational technology services to public schools, including online school registration services and e-transcript services for high school seniors. The state has also used COVID funding for programs to help students make up for  learning loss outside of regular school hours. 
Fletcher ended the letter encouraging superintendents and other stakeholders to contact their federal legislators, along with contact information for the offices of each member of Kentucky’s congressional delegation. 
“Take the time to explain to our federal legislators how the sudden change in the liquidation deadline for COVID relief funds by the U.S. Department of Education will negatively impact our schools and districts, particularly the most vulnerable populations in the Commonwealth,” Fletcher wrote.

Ohio House Finance Committee Chairman Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said lawmakers worked through nearly 3,000 amendments to get the current draft. He expects to see additional tweaks before the chamber votes.
The House budget proposal charts a different course than DeWine’s version in several key areas, but the debate is far from done. In the coming weeks, Ohio Senators will take a crack at it and the governor, who has a line-item veto, will get the final say on what expenditures go forward.
Lawmakers and the governor face a July 1 deadline.
Where the House differs

DeWine’s proposal clocked in at $218 billion over two years, with proposed tax increases on gambling, marijuana, and cigarettes. DeWine envisioned a fund for stadium improvements underwritten by gambling receipts, and a $1,000 refundable child tax credit funded by cigarette taxes.
Tax-averse Republicans in the House turned him down.
“There are no tax increases in this budget,” Stewart explained. “We are not raising taxes on sports betting, marijuana or tobacco products. If there was a tax credit program that was tied to those tax increases, we have not included that in this budget either.”
Ohio Gov. DeWine emphasizes workforce, child care programs in State of the State address

While the child tax credit is gone, Stewart did lay out a $10 million child care cost-sharing pilot. The program borrows from an idea called tri-share which splits the cost between employers, employees and the state.
“There’s a bill that would say, make it a third, a third and a third,” Stewart explained. “We’re trying to be a little more fiscally responsible and say, well, let’s make the state’s third maybe more like 20% and see how it goes.”
And instead of establishing a long-term funding source for all future stadium projects, Stewart said House leaders are OK with an ad hoc approach.
The Cleveland Browns want $600 million in state-backed bonds for a new stadium in Brook Park, and House Republicans are on board. Stewart compared the stadium deal to spending lawmakers regularly approve in the capital budget.
“This is obviously a bigger project than a splash pad in Circleville,” he said, “but it’s the same kind of concept.”
A sports facilities deals expert has warned that the projections by the Browns for revenue to repay the bonds are “way too optimistic,” reports the Statehouse News Bureau.
The budget from 30,000 feet
The House will keep the governor’s updates to the merit scholarship program — “maybe my favorite part of the proposal,” Stewart said — which give the top 5% of a high school’s class guaranteed admission at state schools. Those students can also get up to $5,000 each year for four years if they study in-state.
State university funding will get a 2% bump under the House plan, and tuition increases would be capped at 3% a year for the next two years.
Public libraries would see their funding model change. Instead of a dedicated percentage of the general revenue fund, the House proposes putting a dollar figure on their appropriation: $485 million in the 2026 fiscal year and $495 million in the next.
House lawmakers are also attempting to include provisions requiring “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression” be kept in an area away from minors.
Perhaps the most significant move comes from the House plan to rein in property taxes.
“Ohio’s public school districts had a carry-over cash balance of $10.5 billion at the end of the last fiscal year,” Stewart said. And although a rainy-day fund is a good idea, he argued 528 of the state’s 609 districts are carrying over 25% or more of their operating budget. Public school funding comes from property taxes and the House budget proposes capping school district carry-over at 25% to provide “immediate relief” to taxpayers.
“We believe that those monies are better in the taxpayers pocket than in the school district’s bank account just accumulating,” Stewart argued.
School districts will receive more funding than they did in the prior fiscal year, but nowhere near as much as they expected — a point which Democrats were quick to criticize.
In a statement, Minority Leader Allison Russo argued property tax relief is “overdue” but “Ohioans deserve a budget that benefits our children by properly funding public education.”

(File) 
A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the security of Georgia’s electronic voting machines even though the judge maintained substantial concerns about the system.
According to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg ruling issued Monday, the plaintiffs in Curling v Raffensperger are not able to demonstrate that the state’s electronic voting system disenfranchises them from exercising their right to vote in elections.
She wrote that the election activists Coalition for Good Governance and Georgia voters lacked standing in the lawsuit.
Totenberg also wrote that some of the plaintiffs legal objections to the touchscreen ballot marking devices are more about policy disagreements rather than constitutional violations.
Totenberg, however, wrote that she has substantial concerns about the electronic voting technology that has long faced allegations about the risks of being hacked and potentially compromising elections in Georgia.
The state’s electronic Dominion Voting Systems machines were rolled out statewide in 2019, but by that time the state was already involved in the pre-emptive federal court legal battle with the Coalition for Good Governance and other individual plaintiffs who claim that the electronic system is vulnerable to cyber attack and operational problems that violate voters’ constitutional rights.
Totenberg credited the plaintiff’s role in providing evidence that exposed a major breach of election equipment in Coffee County following the 2020 election.
Also, she cited a report by a University of Michigan expert on cyber security that detailed the potential threats to ballot marking devices, as well as the possibility that future elections could be compromised by unauthorized access to voter data.
Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger applauded Totenberg’s ruling in the District Court for Northern District of Georgia case. Raffensperger has long defended the security of Dominion voting machines, arguing that there is no evidence of fraud affecting Georgia’s 2020 and 2024 presidential election results.
“Today’s ruling is just one more resounding vindication of Georgia’s elections,” Raffensperger said. “From day one, we knew these accusations were meritless. All the real-world evidence shows that Georgia’s paper ballot system works well. Our local election officials are professionals. And the voters of this state know that their votes are counted securely, accurately, and quickly.”
Paper ballots movement
The Coalition for Good Governance has long argued that Georgia elections should use hand-marked ballots, claiming that method is the safest way to vote.
The debate over electronic voting machines versus paper ballots was the focus of conspiracy theorists who blamed Dominion’s system for Republican President Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in 2020. Conspiracies about the Dominion machines swirled after Fox News settled a lawsuit with the voting machine maker over the network’s false reports about the system’s reliability.
Over the last couple of years, a prominent pro-paper ballot movement has been led by VoterGa, a largely pro-Trump faction that has urged people to request that state officials get rid of the electronic voting system.
Totenberg wrote Monday that the case has led to some Georgia legislative action that assuaged some of her concerns, such as the Dominion machines relying on use of QR codes for counting votes on paper ballots, a practice that has been criticized by ballot security advocates.
Last year the Georgia Legislature approved Senate Bill 189, which calls for replacing the QR code by July 1, 2026 with a new method of either readable text or a bubble style mark similar to what is currently used for absentee and provisional ballots.
Next year, the paper ballots movement could gain traction in the  Legislature through Senate Bill 214,  which would allow Georgia voters to cast a hand-marked paper ballot at polling places during early voting and on Election Day. The measure, which was approved last week by a Senate Ethics Committee, would give voters the ability to cast their votes in polling places using pen or pencils, which can now be used to complete absentee ballots. This year is the first in a two-year cycle and bills that don’t pass this year will be alive in 2026.
“Although the plaintiffs have not prevailed in this court of law, their advocacy has helped spark real legislative action,” Totenberg wrote.
“If (SB 189) legislative measures are ultimately funded and implemented, they are the type of legislative action that bolster public confidence in the management of Georgia’s voting system,” Totenberg wrote. “Through litigation and other means, plaintiffs no doubt played a part in prompting these changes.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida House committee approved a bill to eliminate key child labor protections, in the measure’s first sign of life in the chamber. 
A similar bill passed a Senate committee last week to the dismay of critics worried that the measure would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work longer hours, as well as 14- and 15-year-olds who receive permission from their school superintendent or are home schooled or enrolled in online school. 
Florida Senate committee votes to repeal child labor restrictions

The House bill would remove Florida child labor protections by allowing minors to work more than 30 hours per week during the school year; work more than eight hours in a day without a 30-minute break; and work more than eight hours the day before a school day.
Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican representing part of Brevard County, is leading the bill through the House, which is similar to Sen. Jay Collins’ version in the Senate, including two amendments made Tuesday in the House. Collins represents part of Hillsborough County.
As amended, the House bill, HB 1225, now would prevent students from working overnight before school days. The original filed bill, along with Collins’ existing language, axes a state law cutting off minors’ workdays at 11 p.m. The House amendment now proposes cutting off work before a school day at 10 p.m.  
The other amendment, Miller said, was to include a request from former Sen. Randy Fine, on behalf of his son David, to enable 13-year-olds to work during the summer during the year they turn 14. 
Regardless of Florida law, employers have to abide by federal minor employment regulations, particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act, which mostly prohibits 13-year-olds from working in jobs outside of agriculture. 
“Because federal law says that children cannot work under age 14 except in agricultural settings, this amendment only serves to change the age a Florida child can work on a farm from 14 to 13,” Florida Policy Institute CEO Sadaf Knight said in a news release. 
“This alarming development seemingly looks to our youngest teens to fill an agricultural labor shortage gap. If lawmakers truly prioritize the health, safety, and education of Florida youth, they will reject any further undoing of child labor protections in our state.”
Last week, before the amendment reinstating a prohibition for overnight work was filed, House Speaker Daniel Perez said he had “personal concerns” with the bill and that he has “been kind of going back and forth.”
Rep. Michele Rayner argued that some children lack  guardians who might protect them against exploitation, while Rep. Yvonne Hinson said she’s concerned the bill is not considerate of educational outcomes. 
“I really have a problem with this, because the unintended consequence could potentially be exploitation of our children,” Rep. Angie Nixon said.
As for potential pressure from employers  to work excessive hours, “God gave us a great barrier for that, and that is parents. Parents can definitely oversee what children are allowed to do,” Miller said. 
However, she confirmed there was no provision in the bill addressing parental rights for employed minors.

DeSantis comment
Democrats and some public speakers referenced comments from Gov. Ron DeSantis two weeks ago, when he said, “Why do we say that we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be able to do this stuff.”
Miller and Collins both deflected that the governor’s comments addressed a labor shortfall amid stricter immigration enforcement and instead talked about how minors benefit from having a job. 
Miller said the bill is “giving them the opportunity to be productive citizens when they graduate.”
The bill passed the subcommittee 12-6.
The no-votes came from Democrats joined by GOP Rep. Susan Valdes, who switched her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican before this session.
The bill is assigned to two additional committees — Intergovernmental Affairs and Commerce. 
“I’m once again here speaking on behalf of our students who are currently in class trying to get their education, trying to move forward, and they cannot be here to speak to all of you as adults that are putting their lives at risk, in jeopardy,” Laura Muñoz, civic engagement director with Florida Student Power, said during public testimony on the bill. 
The meeting was attended by several youth advocates from Minds Without Borders, Youth Action Fund, and Florida Student Power Network.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)All five members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation signed a letter sent Tuesday to the federal Office of Personnel Management, calling on the agency to provide as much information as possible about federal firings that members said “threaten the effective functioning of critical federal services and will harm our constituents.”
According to the letter, about 30,000 federal employees live and work in New Mexico. But the federal government, in several waves of attempted mass firings since President Donald Trump took office in January, has refused to provide updates about how many of them have been fired, placed on leave or accepted deferred resignations. 
“The Administration’s executive overreach could cripple federal agencies, including in critical areas of disaster preparedness, public health, public safety, and national security,” the letter says. 
The letter asks OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell to provide detailed information about how many personnel in New Mexico have been affected by the federal cuts. 
According to the Department of Workforce Solutions, 29,630 employees work in buildings owned by the federal government. A little more than 15% of all employees in rural Catron and Hidalgo Counties, for example, work in federally owned facilities. 
A large proportion of Hidalgo County residents work for United States Customs and Border Protection, and a large proportion of Catron County residents work for the United States Forest Service, according to economic base analyses from New Mexico State University. 
The state data says that just 277 employees in Los Alamos County work in federally owned buildings. A DWS spokesperson did not respond to a Source New Mexico inquiry about why that number appeared to be so low, given the vast Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Regardless, cuts have affected numerous federal agencies with big footprints in New Mexico. Dozens of probationary Forest Service employees, for example, have been fired, only to be brought back for a court order and then placed on leave. Congressional staffers in a recent meeting about the upcoming wildfire season described “stonewalling” by Forest Service leaders on the question of how many people were fired.

Specifically, the letter seeks the following information from OPM by April 14:

The number of federal employees in New Mexico who have been fired, taken early retirement, placed on leave or been subject to a “reduction in force” since Jan. 20, 2025. The letter seeks that information broken down by agency, county, congressional level, paygrade and veteran status.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Amid state Board of Education members’ misgivings about its own regulation banning “sexual conduct” from K-12 public schools, the board held off on deciding Tuesday whether to remove 10 more books from school library shelves.
The state board unanimously approved the regulation last year, sending it to the state Legislature. Neither the House nor Senate took a vote on the regulation, which automatically went into effect last June through an apparent fluke that surprised even legislators.
Since the state board’s first review in November, board members have agreed to remove 11 books from public school libraries and keep six others, one of which the board required parental permission to check out. Last month, a five-member committee unanimously recommended removing the 10 books up for consideration.

But ahead of taking a vote Tuesday, board members began to question their own regulation, including whether they had applied it correctly in the past. Many of their questions echoed concerns opponents of the complaint have raised.
“I’m not sure if we’re shooting at the right target, or if we’re shooting whether our range finder is accurate,” said board member David O’Shields, superintendent of Laurens County School District 56.
The first seven books considered didn’t come from a parent challenging a local district’s ruling but by board members working with state Department of Education staff. Board members wanted to consider some widely questioned books to set a precedent for future rulings and hopefully clear up confusion, members said at the time.
Since then, most of the books removed from school libraries, including the 10 up for consideration Tuesday, came to the state board through challenges from one Beaufort County parent. The same parent brought 96 books to the Beaufort County Board of Education for review last year.
The local school board, which considered all the books before the statewide regulation went into effect, declined to remove any of the books from shelves. The same parent could feasibly ask the state board to consider every one of those books under the regulation, said board member Ken Richardson, former chairman of the Horry Georgetown Technical College board.
“When does this thing stop?” Richardson, who represents Horry and Georgetown counties, asked repeatedly.
10 more books recommended for removal in SC from K-12 libraries

“I think that’s the question of the day,” replied board Chairwoman Rita Allison, a former longtime legislator from Spartanburg County.
Board members raised concerns over a single parent being able to bring dozens of requests to the state board, requiring schools across the state to remove them from library shelves, whether or not local community members share the concerns about the books. O’Shields, Allison and Richardson said they had yet to hear complaints about any of the books they had considered in the districts they represented.
“I do not like to come up here every single meeting and vote on books nobody in my area is even talking about,” Richardson said.
Five of the 10 books up for consideration Tuesday are in school libraries in Laurens County School District 56, where O’Shields in superintendent, he said.
Libraries bought those books with the hopes that they would encourage more students to read, while “understanding that children don’t come from a cookie cutter world,” O’Shields said. He questioned whether the board should be considering books as a whole, instead of based on excerpts containing sexual conduct.
In some cases, the sexual conduct that leads the board to remove books from shelves amounts to as little as a few pages in several-hundred-page novels, he said.
“Again, I am not in favor of it,” O’Shields said. “I personally find those pages repugnant.”
But those books can still be important for some students, he said. O’Shields held up a small, yellow tome entitled “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask),” which he deemed his own “puberty book” — the book to which he turned to learn about the changes happening in his adolescence.
“However, this was all I had. You know what I’m saying?” he continued.
For children who have experienced abuse or other struggles, reading stories similar to their own might be especially important, said Tony Vincent, a minister in Seneca. While he wouldn’t be comfortable with his preteen daughters reading some of the books up for review, he also understood that every child is different, he said.
The books “could possibly save lives and help young people understand themselves and their experiences,” said Vincent, who represents Anderson and Oconee counties.
SC teachers say new ‘age-appropriate’ rule is causing confusion. They’re seeking clear guidance.

“Looking at these books outside of the arc of their full stories is a mistake, in my view,” Vincent said.
The board originally approved the regulation in order to protect children from nefarious people looking to introduce them to sexual ideas with the intention of abusing them, said Richard Harrington, who represents Florence and Marion counties. He acknowledged that he didn’t know whether that was actually happening in South Carolina schools, but out of an abundance of caution, the board should continue to remove books that include sexual conduct, he said.
“It would be ill-advised to have these books remain when they could be used for that purpose,” Harrington said.
O’Shields and Vincent asked whether the board could consider a middle ground between removing the books from shelves entirely and allowing any student to access them. The board has already done something similar once, by requiring parental permission to check out “Crank” by Ellen Hopkins.
“I’m asking for something so it’s not, ‘goodnight, sweet prince,’ for these books,” O’Shields said.
The board voted to postpone a decision on the 10 books up for consideration Tuesday until members can get more clarification on the regulation in hopes of assuaging some of their concerns or determining whether the regulation needs any changes.
The next time the board could take a vote would be at its May 6 meeting.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3297-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

Cooper Jo Frederick, who was previously arrested by Loveland police and charged with multiple felonies under Colorado state law, was taken into custody in Texas after a federal investigation, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a video posted to social media Monday evening.
Frederick is accused of igniting an unspecified “incendiary device” near the Loveland Tesla building, which started a small fire “between two vehicles” that was extinguished by a responding officer, according to the Loveland Police Department’s account of the incident.

In the federal indictment, filed on March 27 by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver, Frederick was charged with one count of possessing a “destructive device” and one count of attempting to “damage and destroy, by means of fire and explosive materials, vehicles used in interstate or foreign commerce.”
Bondi called the incident part of “a wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties.” Elon Musk, the electric car company’s CEO and the world’s richest person, has been the target of nationwide protests for his extraordinary involvement in President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign and the early actions taken by his administration, including the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and its spree of mass firings and attempted agency shutdowns.
The March 7 fire at the Loveland Tesla location followed at least three other instances of attempted arson or vandalism at the same property this year, according to police. Dozens of similar incidents have been reported across the country and even in other countries around the world. Trump’s Department of Justice last week launched a task force to investigate the incidents.
Frederick’s indictment indicates that federal prosecutors will move to keep him in pretrial detention and seek a prison sentence of up to 20 years if convicted.
“All of these cases are a serious threat to public safety,” Bondi said. “Therefore, there will be no negotiation.”

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Distracted driving incidents led to the deaths of more than 3,000 Americans in 2022, according to data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
In hopes of reducing those corresponding statistics in Florida, individuals and families who have lost loved ones to distracted driving incidents have galvanized this year behind bipartisan legislation that would ban drivers from operating a motor vehicle while using a cellphone in a handheld manner.
The Senate version (SB 1318), sponsored by Southeast Florida Republican Erin Grall, would expand the existing prohibition on texting while driving to include “using, while driving, a wireless communications device in a handheld manner except to activate, deactivate, initiate, or terminate a feature or function of the device, including a hands-free accessory.”
It passed in the Senate Rules Committee on Tuesday, and now will go the Senate floor for final passage.
It’s another story in the House, however. It’s version (HB 501), sponsored by North Florida Democrat Allison Tant, has gone nowhere to date, and advocates are concerned that another year will go without doing anything to change driver behavior when it comes to our obsession with not being able to look at our phone for 10 minutes.
“The public wants and expects these common-sense laws to pass, and not even allowing it a hearing or the public a voice in this debate is not right,” said Jennifer Smith with StopDistractions.org, a nonprofit group made up of families who have been harmed by distracted driving.
So far, the legislation’s trajectory has been the exact opposite of what occurred last session. That’s when a version of Tant’s bill won approval in three House committees before dying on the floor, while its Senate companion never was heard in committee.
Other states continue to act. Last week, the Iowa Senate passed a bill expanding an existing ban on texting while driving to cover any handheld use of a cellphone, with the measure now headed to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk. Once it is signed, Iowa will become the 32nd state to adopt such laws.

It took years for Florida to pass a texting-while-driving law during the last decade, and it took Michigan five years to pass a hands-free law, said Steve Kiefer, whose son Mitchel was killed in 2016 at 18 by a driver who was on Snapchat when she rear-ended him. He now runs the Kiefer Foundation, dedicated to ending distracted driving, from his home in Naples.
“Police officers want laws that they can enforce, and hands-free laws are really the only law that we know that will make it very visual,” he said.
That sentiment was shared by William B. Smith, a state trooper from Miami, when speaking at the Senate Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development last week. “It is a problem. Distracted driving is a current problem and it will continue to be problem as long as we don’t pay attention … to what we’re doing when we’re driving a 6,000 pound killing machine,” he said.
Stalled in the House
Tant’s bill has landed in two House committees, starting with the Government Operations Subcommittee, chaired by Pinellas County Republican Linda Chaney, as well State Affairs, chaired by Manatee County Republican Will Robinson. Neither returned requests for comment.
The legislation would “authorize law officers to stop motor vehicles and issue citations to persons who are using wireless communications devices in a handheld manner while driving.”
That concerns GOP Sen. Tom Leek, who said while discussing Grall’s bill last week in the committee hearing that while he voted to advance the measure, he struggled with “giving the ability of a government actor to pull you over for doing something that is entirely legal, like holding a telephone.”
But Kiefer blasts that take.
“He was basically saying, ‘It’s a primary offense to hold a phone. Something that is absolutely legal to do,'” said Kiefer.
“If I was in the room, I would have pointed it out to him that it’s also legal to drink, and it’s even legal to be drunk in your home, but it’s not legal to drink and drive in a car where you’re going to harm other people,” he said. “So, I think it’s just very uninformed politicians that don’t really understand what the law would do and how effective it has been in every other state.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, GOP senators Jonathan Martin and Blaise Ingoglia were the only members of the committee to oppose the measure. Both said that they thought it was too incremental, and didn’t go far enough in terms of attacking all distracted driving.
“If we were going to crackdown on distracted driving, we would be including things like shaving, which we’ve all seen,” Ingoglia said. “Doing makeup in your vehicle. Eating while driving. Those are all distractions. Anything that takes somebody’s attention off of the road into something else in the vehicle should be a form of distracted driving, and it should be dealt with as such.”
Leon County resident Christopher Chapman, who testified earlier in the meeting to describe how life has been much tougher for him after he was injured by a distracted driver, shook his head while listening to Ingoglia’s and Martin’s quibbles.
“I will agree that this bill is imperfect, but it’s the bill that we have in front of us,” he told the Phoenix following the meeting. “And it does give us a platform to build upon where we can invoke more stringent requirements or more stringent penalties.”
Change of Heart
Demetrius Branca lost his son Anthony to a distracted driving accident in 2014, and has made it his mission in his life to get the state to enact tougher laws. That includes attending legislative delegation meetings throughout the state.

In January, he publicly confronted Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie for his failure to agenda the bill in a committee he chaired last year. The two had words after the meeting, and DiCeglie said he wasn’t happy with Branca calling him out.
But in Tuesday’s committee, DiCeglie said his conversation with Branca changed his attitude on the issue.
‘I tried to take the emotion out of it,” DiCeglie told Branca. “I looked at the statistics. I  looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son Anthony.”
“I’m proud that you’re standing here in front of us today telling your story,” DiCeglie added. “That has translated into what I believe is good public policy, and I think that’s going to translate into saving lives. And regardless of what happens this point forward, I  think that you can look yourself in the mirror and know that you did what was right in your heart.”
If Tant’s bill doesn’t get heard soon in the House, such legislation is likely dead for 2025, something Kiefer says will be an irresponsible decision by lawmakers.
“It took us five years to get it done in Michigan,” he acknowledged. “We’ve got people playing politics in the House and they won’t hear it in the subcommittees, which of course will block it.”

Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis revealed during Tuesday’s committee meeting that her sister was killed by a distracted driver while jogging in Tallahassee. Although the proposal doesn’t address the entire problem, she said, it is a necessary first step.
“Colleagues, we need your help in ensuring that the House chamber understands how important this is as well,” she said.
Grall ended her close on the bill Tuesday by getting intensely personal with her colleagues.
“If it’s not your family who has someone taken from you, what if it’s you who takes someone from someone else? How will you carry that with you? We must change our behavior. This is to me is not acceptable any longer. If we can’t be examples from this chamber, with this legislature, then we have a problem.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Justice admitted in separate court filings that his deportation to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, was an “administrative error.""""This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia’s purported membership in MS-13,"" ICE Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Robert L.

Because of this condition, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE each year, which he has complied with since 2019, according to court filings.""Who does that judge work for?

The latest iteration of the battle is contained in SB 172, a 10-page bill that broadens the state’s authority to prosecute professionals regulated by the Department of Health who mislead, deceive, or fraudulently misrepresent their qualifications to the public. The Rules Committee approved the bill by a 22-1 vote. It now heads to the full Senate for consideration.
The bill would amend legislative intent language to make clear the public health, safety, and welfare could be harmed by health care providers who misrepresent their ability to practice a profession.
Broad authority
Although he voted for the bill, Sen. Jason Pizzo, an attorney, noted the broad regulatory power it would give the Florida Department of Health when prosecuting health care providers for advertising.
“If a person engages in the unlawful practice of law, it’s because they actually took up a matter, conducted a transaction, gave advice, all of that stuff.  I guess very specifically for legislative intent, the wording of your bill sort of suggests just using the title alone — without actually like seeing a patient or engaging in any conduct or behavior — standing alone just using the titles is the unlawful practice of medicine,” he said.
In addition, the bill amends the laws regulating allopathic physicians, referred to as “M.D.s,” and osteopathic physicians, referred to as “D.O.s,” to include a  list of 39 specialities practitioners are authorized to call themselves. It would be a violation for any other health care professionals to use those titles.
The bill provides exceptions for chiropractic physicians, podiatric physicians, dentists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and anesthesiology assistants, allowing them to call themselves by certain titles already in their practice acts or included in their specialty certifications.
There is no exception for optometrists, who are often referred to as eye doctors or, according to Florida Optometric Association lobbyist David Ramba, optometric physician.
The list of 39 protected titles does not include the term physician or medical doctor but includes a variety of specialties such as anesthesiologist; cardiologist; dermatologist; endocrinologist; and gastroenterologist. It also includes the term surgeon.
The optometrists did not publicly oppose the bill in committee Tuesday but Ramba said the group isn’t on board.
“The bill says we can use whatever titles are in our practice act. Never before in state law has it required titles to be in a practice act or even in state law. Since the Senate has blocked any optometry practice act updates since 2013, we are opposed to legislation that would not allow us to use titles commonly used in the field such as ‘optometric physician,'” he said.
Eyeball wars
Scope of practice refers to the range of health care services authorized by statute and the educational requirements these providers must attain. Proposals to change scope of practice can be some of the most controversial bills legislators deal with, as they balance economic interests against patient care.
Sen. Don Gaetz iconically dubbed the long-standing fight between optometrists and ophthalmologists and the care the two professions can offer patients as the “eyeball wars” in the mid-2000s, when he served as Senate president.
Sen. Kathleen Passidomo said she’s been working on this for nearly a decade. A 2023 version of the bill was passed when Passidomo was Senate president but it was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Pizzo asked whether there were assurances that this year’s version of the bill wouldn’t be vetoed.
Passidomo said, “We shall see.”
Before the governor could approve the bill, it first it has to pass. As the 2025 session approaches its midway point, the House companion, HB 1341, has yet to be heard.

The House Judiciary Committee still gave Senate Bill 2128 a do-not-pass recommendation. 
Committee chair Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who authored some of the amendments to the bill, said it wasn’t clear how the changes would affect the cost estimate of the bill. 
Klemin said his intention was that a new cost estimate would be generated for the bill. 
North Dakota attorney general calls for more prison time; opponents say spend more on police

The original intent of the bill, which came from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s office, was to ensure that criminals housed by the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spend more of their sentence behind bars. 
The fiscal note tied to the original bill estimated the cost to the state at $22.7 million in the 2025-27 biennium and $21.3 million for the following two years.
North Dakota’s prison system is already overcrowded and Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, wondered how the original bill could be workable. 
“Where are these people going to go?” Vetter asked, adding that there is no plan to build more prison space. 
Colby Braun, director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, has contended that the original bill would cut off access to rehabilitation programs and halfway houses. 
The amendments remove a key provision requiring that offenders serve at least 50% of their sentence behind bars before being eligible for a halfway house or parole. 
The amendments include ensuring that prisoners are eligible to go into a halfway house for the last six months of their sentences and adding money for electronic monitoring bracelets and penalties for tampering with an electronic monitoring device. 
The amendments passed on a 8-5 vote. A do-not-pass recommendation made by Rep. Bill Tveit, R-Hazen, passed 9-5. 
Tveit resisted the Klemin amendments as continuing a soft-on-crime policy and said the state can afford the costs of sending prisoners to another state if North Dakota doesn’t have room.

The amended bill gives Legislative Management the option to study parole and the state corrections system. 
“The parole board is a really big player and we haven’t heard from them,” Klemin said. 
Klemin said the amended bill could be a bridge until the studies could provide legislators with more guidance. 
The bill still includes additional penalties for fleeing and assaulting officers. 
The amendments will need to be approved on the House floor. If approved the bill will likely be heard in the House Appropriations Committee next week, according to committee chair Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A bill that aims to encourage condominium construction by lowering litigation risks passed the Colorado House on Monday.
House Bill 25-1272 passed on a bipartisan 59-5 vote, with some of the chamber’s most progressive Democrats voting against it.
It is the Legislature’s second attempt in as many years to pass a policy to reverse the decline in condo construction in the state, which supporters see as an accessibly priced option for first-time buyers who want to stop renting but can’t afford a detached single-family home. In February, the median single-family home in Colorado was $640,000 and the average condo was $424,200, according to RedFin.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The number of condo developers in Colorado dropped by 84% between 2007 and 2022, partially due to rising liability insurance costs and frequent litigation from homeowners, according to a report from the Common Sense Institute.
“The current course that we are on right now is unacceptable. Our kids and our grandkids, for those of us who are older — they need a better future than (for) their only hope to ever be a forever tenant,” bill sponsor Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, said ahead of the vote. “That is no way to achieve financial security and stability and to become a permanent member of your community. They need the chance to have home ownership.”
The bill would create an incentive program for multifamily builders to opt into, dubbed the Multifamily Construction Incentive Program. They would need to hire a qualified third-party inspector to review the project as it is being built and offer a warranty for any defect or damage the owner discovers, ranging from one year for workmanship problems and six years for major structural issues.
In exchange, the builder would be protected from construction defect claims unless the damage affects the home’s functionality or safety, including an inability to use the property, failure of a building component, injury or death.
Under the program, an owner would have six years to bring an action and the builder would need to offer to fix the defect.
The idea is to address problems without litigation, encouraging more insurers to back projects in Colorado.
“They know that those homes will be built right in the first place, but also that the first mechanism for fixing an issue — God forbid if one exists — isn’t simply litigation. In the case of the program, the expectation is that they exhaust the remedies offered to them through the warranty, knowing that if the warranty is insufficient or doesn’t meet the need at stake, a homeowner still has the opportunity to litigate that claim,” bill sponsor Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, said during a committee hearing on the bill in March.
That incentive program was amended into the bill, as well as a handful of other amendments, to appease some homeowners and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. As introduced, the bill would have protected builders during defect litigation as long as they had a certificate of occupancy from a local government.
Questions linger
A separate bill sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, would have added more protections for homeowners in defect litigation, but she pulled it when some of its provisions got rolled into HB-1272. That includes a requirement for builders to give a claimant documents related to building plans, soil reports, maintenance recommendations and insurance.
Still, Bacon said there are questions lingering about the process and cost to homeowners who find construction defects under the proposed program.
Her bill would have changed the statute of limitations for defect claims to begin when a homeowner discovers a problem, not when the problem happens in the first place, but that timeline switch did not make it into the amended HB-1272.
“We’re still looking forward to striking a balance where we could confidently say that we have created a program where builders will build, but also the things that were bargained with that have to do with homeowners are not going to leave them in a place where they have to buy at their own risk, and that is incredibly important,” she said ahead of the final House vote.
The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration, where it is sponsored by Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat. Six senators, including three Republicans, are already signed on in support.

Bill cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, has said the goal of House Bill 135 is to prioritize people who are living in the U.S. with proper authorization to access welfare benefits. Last year, Redman brought a similar bill that failed in committee.

To receive public assistance in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify the lawful presence of adults applying for benefits. But, Idaho law spells out exceptions for certain services, including emergency health care, immunization, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
House Bill 135 would remove some of those exceptions, requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for access to health assistance for immunizations, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
Under the bill, some emergency services would still be exempt from the immigration status verification requirement.

Another bill cosponsor, Sen. Phil Hart, R-Kellogg, told Idaho senators the bill doesn’t prevent people from accessing services. 
“What it does do is it would prevent the state of Idaho for paying for those. So you could still access these types of services through a nonprofit. You could pay for them yourself, or you could get somebody else to pay for them,” Hart said. “And so the impact of the bill, from a financial standpoint, is actually fairly minimal.”
The Idaho Senate passed the bill on a 26-9 vote Tuesday, with all six Senate Democrats opposing the bill, joined by three Republican senators. The House already passed the bill on a 46-22 vote.

Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, opposed the bill. He argued it could affect the public health of Idaho’s entire population — by denying public vaccine coverage for undocumented immigrants.

And he argued the bill, by denying food assistance coverage, conflicts with U.S. Supreme Court precedent that says children born in America are U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents’ citizenship status.
“In this building, we take a great deal of pride in being a pro-life state, and I share in that objective,” Guthrie told senators. “But in this case, the legislation denying prenatal care could compromise lives of the pre-born. And so I guess, unless we’re becoming selective in our application of when pro-life is important, maybe that’s a point to consider.”
 Democrats paint the bill as cruel. Arguing in favor, Sen. Zito says compassion should come earlier.

Sen. Christy Zito, R-Mountain Home, said she kept hearing the word compassion come up in debate on the bill. She argued that should come earlier.

“If I’m a mother and I have children or I’m pregnant and getting ready to have a child, why would I put my children into a position where they were in a country where I had no way to take care of them? Why would I have them in a position where I was a fugitive from the law, where I was already breaking the law by being where I am?” Zito told senators. “I think the compassion begins long before these children are in a position where they need these services. The compassion begins with making sure that we’re good with the law.”
Democrats cast the bill as cruel. Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said when lawmakers debated the issue nearly two decades ago, they were careful to ensure children wouldn’t be denied services.
Sen. Ron Taylor, D-Hailey, said he asked himself two questions on the bill.
“Have we as a society lost all respect for decency? I haven’t been able to answer that one yet. I think that question remains to be answered. The second question I asked myself was, ‘What would Jesus do?’” Taylor said. “I answered that question. I’ll be voting no.”
When the bill is transmitted to Gov. Brad Little, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

It’s a state-run program that links people [&#8230;]","Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis touts the Hope Florida program during an April 1, 2025, press conference in the Capitol in Tallahassee. (Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature for the first time this session on Tuesday took up what is being called the Hope Florida Act, which would create the Hope Florida Office within the Executive Office of the Governor.
Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis has led Hope Florida since its creation in 2021. It’s a state-run program that links people in need with social welfare and faith-based community groups. Since its creation, the organization says its “Hope Navigators” have referred more than 100,000 Floridians for assistance, according to the governor’s office.
It’s also seen as a vehicle that Mrs. DeSantis could campaign on should she decide to pull the trigger and run for governor next year.
Committees in both the House and Senate approved the measure on Tuesday. Their votes came shortly after  Gov. Ron DeSantis called in a large number of state troopers to stand behind him at a Capitol news conference to announce that every sheriff’s office throughout the state will have a liaison tasked connecting with those in need.
But there are questions about the program.
The House bill analysis notes that under Florida law, a direct-support organization (DSO) must submit to the agency it supports a number of items, including a copy of the organization’s code of ethics and its most recent tax returns. Existing law also requires each DSO created or authorized with annual expenditures in excess of $100,000 to provide an annual financial audit of its accounts and records.
But Hope Florida has not submitted those reports.
“House staff requested DCF provide all statutorily-required documents for the purpose of this analysis, but DCF did not provide them,” the analysis says, referring to the Department of Children and Families.
Politics of Hope
The House measure (HB 1327), sponsored by Palm Beach Republican Anne Gerwin, won unanimous approval in the Human Services Subcommittee on Tuesday afternoon, despite criticism by Orange County Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani.
“There’s been a lot of politics about Hope Florida over the last four years,” she said. “A lot of concerns that pertains to oversight and accountability, just question marks around where money comes from, how it’s being spent, and I think those are very concerning questions.”
Members of the Legislature have questioned whether Hope Florida is simply duplicating services already being rendered by other states agencies. Gerwin said the difference is that Hope Florida can address ongoing social service problems, adding that it also “creates community.”
“I think it’s community that we used to have in our society,” she said.
During his press conference, Gov. DeSantis bristled when asked by a reporter about why Hope Florida hadn’t filed its tax returns.

“This is the nonprofit arm, it’s a charitable arm. They’re gonna take care of the paperwork, but while you’re worried about filing paperwork, we’re worried about lifting Floridians up,” DeSantis said.
“We’re not worried about trying to play phony gotcha games,” he added later.
‘Lives changed’

Dawn Murray is the director of Hope Florida. An employee with DCF for more than 30 years, she told the House committee that the program is different than anything else the state has attempted.
“Through Hope Florida, Hope Navigators are working with the families based on what they say are their needs, based on what they’re going through,” Murray said. “And through this program I have seen countless lives changed with people getting jobs, people going back to school, and people just understanding that there is hope and that there is people out there supporting them.”
The Senate version, sponsored by Tampa Bay Republican Sen. Danny Burgess (SB 1144), was approved in the Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee on Tuesday as well.
The measure would require all state agencies to participate in Hope Florida if directed to do so by the Executive Office of the Governor. That includes the DCF, Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Department of Juvenile Justice, Statewide Guardian ad Litem Office, Department of Education, Agency for Health Care Administration, Department of Corrections, Division of Emergency Management, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Elderly Affairs.
Those agencies, according to the Senate bill analysis, would be charged with:

Operating the Hope Line, a toll-free hotline for Hope Florida inquiries and referrals;
Maintain a website that allows individuals to connect with Hope Florida to request services or volunteer their time or resources;
Maintain a Hope Florida case management system that can at least conduct intake for Hope Florida inquiries and referrals; and
Work with the Commerce and CareerSource Florida to maintain a portal that integrates with Commerce’s one-stop delivery system to allow for the designation of employers as “Hope Florida Employers” and provide clients access to employment and training services.

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)After a relatively subdued floor debate — at least as far as wolf-related bills go — the Montana Senate on Friday voted to pass three wolf-hunting bills that originated in the House. 
One bill would extend the current wolf hunting season to align with the spring black bear season, one would allow the use of thermal and infrared scopes, and the third would have required an unlimited hunting season for wolves when the statewide population is more than 550 wolves. 
The latter bill, House Bill 176, drew the most attention during multi-hour committee hearings and on the House floor, where it was amended to change a “shall” to a “may,” merely stating that the Fish and Wildlife commission would have the option to create an open season. But that change was reversed with an amendment in the Senate committee. 
But during the weekend, seven Senators changed their minds on the bill, and during Monday’s final vote on HB 176, the measure failed 23-27, after previously passing 26-24.
Two senators, Sen. Gregg Hunter, R-Glasgow, and Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade, changed from nay votes to supporting the bill, while Sens. Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, John Esp, R-Big Timber, Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, Gayle Lammars, R-Hardin, and Sue Vinton, R-Billings, all opposed the bill on their final vote. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, a Polson Republican, carried all three wolf bills on the Senate floor, and opened his talking points by referencing the documents that originally delisted the gray wolf back in 2009, and estimated that the entire wolf population between Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be around 1,100 individuals. 
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks estimates the state’s numbers are around 1,100, Idaho’s is roughly the same, and Wyoming has around 350 wolves. 
“We’ve shown that we’ve reintroduced the wolves, and they have far exceeded where our expectations are,” Hertz said. “So I think some of these new requirements and allowances on wolf hunting should be allowed.”
But opponents said the bill was overly broad by applying to the entire state, rather than the northwest region where wolves are most heavily concentrated, and that overhunting wolves could set the state’s management plans back.
“From a livestock part, we do worry, our associations do, that if we overdo this thing, there’s a great likelihood that the wolves will get back on the Endangered Species list,” Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, said, adding several livestock groups had opposed the bill in committee. “Also, it’s been my goal all along to get the grizzly bears off the Endangered Species list, and this also makes that a lot more complicated, if we reduce our wolf population too much.”
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, echoed Gillespie’s comments, and said that a more targeted management approach would be a better option, and that frustrations that FWP wasn’t doing enough to reduce the population should be addressed through other avenues than legislation. 
Their comments on the floor didn’t seem to dissuade many senators, as the bill initially passed by two votes, but the final tally showed a much stauncher opposition. 
The vote put to bed the biggest legislative directive regarding wolves for the 2025 session. 
The two other bills passed on Friday sailed through their final readings with no vote changes, and will head back to the House for a final vote on Senate amendments. 
House Bill 258, extending the hunting season, was amended to remove a carve-out limiting hunting quotas near Yellowstone National Park — a change originally made by Democratic Representative Scott Rosenzweig of Bozeman to make the bill more appealing to the House. 
House Bill 259, expanding the use of night scopes, was amended to soften the directive from a “shall” to a “may.”
The House has yet to schedule either bill for a floor vote. 
One other wolf-related bill passed the Senate earlier last week, allowing for hunters who lawfully kill wolves to be reimbursed for their hunting or trapping costs.
[subhead] FWP adopts final wolf management plan [/subhead]
Even as the Legislature has continued debating how it wants the state’s wildlife agency to manage the wolf population, FWP announced last week it had adopted the final version of its wolf management plan. 
The new plan is the first comprehensive update to the state’s management plan since 2003, and the department drew upon 20 years of “management experience, evolution in conflict management, new laws, social perspective and public input,” according to an FWP press release. 
 More than 24,000 comments were submitted during the multi-year drafting process. 
“The former wolf plan served us well, but it was time to make sure our management plan contained the evolutions we’ve made in wolf research, monitoring, conflict management, and the changes to the legal framework we operate under today,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in the release.  
According to the department, the foundations for the management plan include: recognizing wolves as part of Montana’s wildlife heritage; approaching wolf management similar to other wildlife species; managing wolf populations across the state with flexibility; and addressing and resolving conflicts.
“The overwhelming success of gray wolf recovery, to date, speaks to its importance and central role in the culture of Montana,” the record of decision for the plan states. ”FWP will continue to ensure the long-term presence of gray wolves in Montana.” 
One of the biggest shifts in the 2025 plan is a change in a “key counting metric” for a minimum population benchmark. The old plan used the federal recovery baseline of having 15 breeding pairs of wolves, while the new baseline uses an estimate of the number of wolves that support 15 breeding pairs. 
FWP’s new plan established 450 wolves as the “benchmark to ensure” 15 breeding pairs, but emphasizes that “this is not FWP’s declared population target.”
Instead, the plan states the wolf population may fluctuate anywhere within the “estimated population size identified during the 2021 Legislative Session,” when a law was passed seeking to reduce the number of wolves to a “sustainable population” of not less than 450.
“Wolf management discussions continue to draw a lot of attention from people in Montana and around the world,” FWP director Clark said. “The 2025 Wolf Plan will ensure those conversations can be grounded in current science and the research FWP is doing every day.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)After hearing a litany of proposals to expand the state’s tax exemption for homeowners, the Legislature’s Taxation Committee moved forward with one amended plan that would increase the exemption for all people incrementally.
In a unanimous vote among those present on Tuesday, the committee voted to advance a plan that would increase the Homestead Property Tax Exemption by $5,000 per year until it reaches a total value of $50,000 from the just value of a home over the course of five years. 
This plan, which is in LD 140, now heads to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for approval. 
Currently, the Homestead Property Tax Exemption provides a reduction for property tax purposes of up to $25,000 from the value of a home. In order to qualify, a homeowner must be a permanent resident of Maine, the home must be their permanent residence and they have to have owned a home in the state for at least one year before applying. 
As originally proposed by Sen. Joseph Baldacci (D-Penobscot), LD 140 would have increased the tax exemption by $10,000 per year until the total exemption reached $95,000. Baldacci argued that incrementally increasing the tax exemption would be the most fiscally responsible method because it will be more feasible for the general fund to absorb costs. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The committee agreed, though opted for smaller increments and a smaller overall increase. 
The smaller increments would now cost the state roughly $14 million per year, compared to double that with the initial proposal, which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) characterized as more reasonable. 
The amended bill also removes adjustments for inflation after the cap, which lawmakers argued felt less pertinent due to the gradual adjustments. 
“It seems like it just makes it extremely complex for everyone and I’m not sure that most taxpayers would even notice that,” said Rep. Gary Friedman (D-Bar Harbor), who proposed the tweaks.
Gov. Janet Mills’ administration testified against LD 140, and the several other proposed reforms to the homestead exemption, arguing it will shift the property tax burden to other taxpayers and result in an increase in property tax mill rates over time.
“LD 140 would provide broad property tax relief to resident homeowners, regardless of their ability to pay the tax, at a very high cost, when more focused tax relief could be provided at a much lower cost using the Property Tax Fairness Credit or other programs,” Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the committee earlier this month. 
Last year, lawmakers expanded eligibility to the Property Tax Fairness Credit — which provides refunds for property taxes or rent paid — and created a Property Tax Deferral Program, specifically to soften the blow from the short-lived Property Tax Stabilization Program that allowed older Mainers to freeze their property taxes. 
The Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
The Taxation Committee is hearing other proposals aimed at controlling property taxes on Wednesday, including legislation to reinstate the Property Tax Stabilization Program and amend the state constitution to require greater state reimbursement for residential property tax exemptions and increase the minimum homestead exemption to $50,000.
Bipartisan efforts to expand property tax exemptions face pushback from Mills administration

While advancing Baldacci’s proposal, the committee voted Tuesday against four other proposals to expand the homestead exemption in other ways, including through one lump increase or only for particular groups. 
These rejected proposals included LD 658, sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), which would double the exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 of the just value of a home. 
Two had focused specifically on residents who are 65 years old or older. LD 7, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), proposes increasing the exemption to $75,000 for that group, while LD 934, sponsored by Rep. Stephen Wood (R-Greene), proposed a greater exemption amount for that group, as well as veterans. 
LD 570, sponsored by Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), would provide an additional tax exemption of $75,000 to families and individuals who make below a certain income, bringing the total tax exemption available for those eligible up to $100,000.
The votes against these other plans were also unanimous among those present. 
The committee has yet to take action on LD 559, sponsored by Sen. Donna Bailey (D-York), which would allow municipalities to adopt a property tax stabilization program for their senior residents approved by local ordinance.

UBS Financial Services and one of its managing directors, Andrew Burish, are suing a group of nine New Hampton, Iowa, residents in U.S. District Court, all of whom are former UBS customers, and most of whom are part of the same family: Dennis, Leslie, Tyler and Noelle Hansen; Bradley and Jordan Nelson; Lindsey and Nicholas Valentini; and Hansen family friend Mark Kramer.
The New Hampton residents allegedly reaped profits of nearly $1.5 million by short-selling various stocks, including Tesla, for two years beginning in 2017. In late 2019, they allegedly resumed short-selling one particularly volatile stock, Tesla.
Typically, short-selling involves borrowing shares from a broker and immediately selling them. Then, if the price falls as expected, the investor buys back the same number of shares at the lower price, realizes a profit, and returns the shares to the broker.
The strategy is risky and only works if the stock’s price falls after the initial sale, allowing the stock to be repurchased at a lower cost.
In the case of Tesla, its stock price began an unprecedented and unexpected climb in late 2019, right when the Hansens invested.
Court records indicate that throughout 2020, the Hansens’ losses mounted, but they stuck with their strategy, believing Tesla’s price would eventually fall. Eventually, their total losses exceeded $23 million.
In 2022, the family and Kramer initiated a claim against UBS and Burish, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rules governing investment advice, and negligent supervision of a financial advisor.
The family claimed Burish had given them unsuitable and one-sided investment advice concerning their strategy to short-sell stock in Tesla. They also claimed Burish had violated the law by sending them unsuitable investment advice via text messages that he later deleted, and that he fraudulently led them to believe he, too, was short-selling Tesla stock even after he was no longer participating in that strategy.
In late February, an arbitrator’s panel sided with the Hansens and found UBS liable for compensatory damages of $23,059,522 and Burish liable for compensatory damages of $2,562,169.
In addition, the panel awarded $69,178,566 in punitive damages from UBS and $500,000 in punitive damages from Burish.
In their newly filed lawsuit, UBS and Burish argue that “the panel’s award of nearly $70 million in punitive damages was grossly excessive, irrational, and contrary to well-defined and dominant public policy.” They allege the maximum punitive award against UBS should have been $23,059,522 — an amount equal to the compensatory damages.
In addition, UBS and Burish argue that in cases where the fact finder does not state the conduct justifying the punitive damages was directed specifically at the claimants in the case, at least 75% of any punitive damages must go to a civil reparations trust fund that is administered by the state court administrator.  In the UBS case, the lawsuit claims, the panel awarded the Iowans the full $69 million in punitive damages, with nothing allocated to the civil reparations trust fund.
UBS: Hansens were savvy investors
In a brief filed in January with the arbitration panel, lawyers for the Hansens argued UBS had failed to ask Burish “fundamental investor protection questions, like why clients with no experience managing a short position or margin calls would be suitable candidates to short sell one of the most volatile stocks of all time.”
UBS’ attorney, Neal S. Robb, told the arbitration panel that Tesla was always considered a risky investment, and claimed the Hansen family was a financially savvy group of investors that “was wealthy enough to take the loss” stemming from its Tesla investments.
“The Hansens were not retirees, or socking their money away for the day that they were puttering in the garden,” Robb told the panel. “They were aggressive with their money. Putting it in ethanol plants and in jet aircraft leasing is not only sophisticated stuff, it’s relatively risky stuff.”
As for Tesla, Robb argued the company’s stock “was never relatively stable” and said it was “amazing” the company had progressed so far in recent years.
“In 2017, 2018, 2019, it was plagued with problems,” Robb told the panel. “It had continuous losses. It was running in the red. It had production problems, but at the same time it was a favorite of speculators, and the stock price zipped and zagged and went up or down. The panel may remember some of the things that happened with Tesla. At one point the CEO, Mr. Elon Musk, announced he was going to take the company private, and he had funding, which will become the subject of another big lawsuit, and the stock price went up. At another point, Mr. Musk tweeted the stock price was too high, and the stock price plummeted. So, Tesla was always a very, very volatile stock. It was never relatively stable.”
Attorneys for the Hansens argued before the panel that Burish had encouraged the family, via text messages that he later deleted, to short-sell Tesla stock, telling them, “I’m doing this with my daughter, family, friends. I’ll be doing it alongside you,” when in fact he had stopped shorting Tesla long before.
In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a set of findings involving UBS, alleging that from at least January 2018 to September 2021, UBS employees sent and received off-channel communications with investors that it never preserved, in violation of federal regulations. That alleged failure “was firm-wide, and involved employees at all levels of authority,” the SEC found.
As a result of those findings, the SEC imposed a $125 million civil money penalty against the company.
Attorneys for the Hansen family and the other defendants in the newly filed lawsuit have yet to respond to UBS’ claims that the punitive damages are excessive.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gavel-cash.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

(Photo by raclro via Getty Images)The American republic is lost according to both sides of the political debate, and now Utah is talking about civics education? There is no part of Utah society that has not contributed significantly to our secular sector decline since World War II, but now Utah is talking about civics education to tame our rag-tag citizens and give them a reason to be a better people?
Gov. Spencer Cox recently signed two bills intended to get civics education back on track in Utah public schools and public universities, HB381 and SB334. Both these efforts, while in part well intentioned, are thoroughly cosmetic, as one might expect. Materialistic priorities will always reign supreme in a state that believes that building programs are the measure of its success.
In the first place, the governor says a “foundational civic education in our high schools will aid our students with a better understanding of our government institutions and their critical role in American society.” While a better understanding of anything is a good thing, understanding our “government institutions” is problematic since on the national level we virtually don’t have two of our three original branches of government any longer — a functioning Congress and an independent judiciary. Both these institutions have been taken over by an anti-civic movement whose current autocratic and oligarchic interests likely will be programmed into the new Utah curriculum rendering it virtually a dead letter from the get-go.
The business and banking sector in Utah has led the charge into our current social and economic oblivion by focusing on the financial rapine of the middle and working classes, environmental and water supply exploitation and degradation, and a building program focused on luxury living for the well-off. And now Utah is talking about civics education?
The family system has fallen into ruin due to divorce, legalized pornography, sports gambling, loss of physical fecundity in marriage, and huge declines in physical and mental health. And now Utah has decided to talk about the morals and ethics and habits of the ancestors?
The churches have long been withdrawn from civic engagement and scholastic achievement, but now it’s time to mend those tattered fences? Education has fallen into such a cloud of disrepair at all levels that lifelong learning is a relic of antiquity, and the entire society believes there is nothing to be gained at school any longer because school doesn’t prepare youth for skilled employment in the technology sector. And now we think it is time to recover a modicum of the reason public education came into being in America in the first place?
Even if Congress and the courts still had some kind of job to do in the new authoritarian scheme of things, the focus of the new civics program would still skirt the most important facet of government fundamentals, which is not the physical structure of government and the buildings and places they are housed, but the law governing the operation of the branches. Those who will be programming the new curriculum do not know nor do they care about what the written law of this country says about the operation of government. In every pronouncement of theirs in defense of the new program, they studiously ignore what the written document boldly asserts. Our Founding Fathers and Mothers will not be heard in the new curriculum. They will be silenced as they have been for generations in Utah.
While one of the “primary source documents” in the high school curriculum is “The United States Constitution,” both our major political parties today are perfectly satisfied to just have people glance at them sideways without an ounce of explanation about how far we have departed from them today, or why, or how we can return to them.
Reading the foundational documents will do some good but is not nearly enough to do substantial good for students. Reading them is like reading the scripture. After you read a passage of the scripture in English, you know what the text says, but you don’t know what it means. A perfect example is a passage like, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Everybody knows, even our smart theologians who write books about the Ten Commandments, that that verse means, “Don’t swear (out loud).”
However, that is not even close to the original and authentic meaning of the passage. One needs to know the historical context of the passage — its political, economic, social, and legal context. Where, oh where are Utah students going to get into the deep history and secular basis of either scripture or of democracy? Certainly not from Utah politicians, or politically motivated curriculum sponsors who care not for the reality of life, but only for the shiny presentation of it.
Students need to not only read the constitutional law, but the history of how those laws were developed and applied across the great democracies of the past. The words “Rome” and “Athens” are found in the talk surrounding the passage of the bills, but that likely will be the end of it. The bankers and builders of Utah don’t care about Rome or Athens, and they don’t even know that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament is a sophisticated civics education text in and of itself, a constitutional history of an ancient democratic republican society. They think it is an encouragement to go to church.
Students also need to know what the basic alternative to republican government is — monarchy — what its underlying philosophy is, and how it figures into the past 5,500 years of recorded life on planet earth. Bankers and builders love monarchy, but they prefer to implement it clandestinely rather than openly, so it will never be discussed in the new curriculum.
For example, the religious-political philosophy of scripture and of democracy says that all human beings are capable of governing themselves locally by means of elected representatives. They also need to know that monarchy is a system where the blood of a dynasty of rulers is believed to be superior to the blood of common folk, enabling the rich to claim a mandate of heaven to rule forever however they wish to rule. Democracy says everyone has the same blood and the same DNA and everyone has the same capacity to do great things if given the education and the opportunity.
Consensual policymaking is of little good without an extremely well-educated citizenry, who bend their discretionary time to life-long learning and regular participation in good citizenship activities. None of that is happening in Utah or any other state of the nation today, so new initiatives such as HB381 and SB334 are destined to be either for show, or to serve as conduits for propaganda efforts by political party leaders.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1413318210-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

“The goal is to quickly restore all trips, but with a limited number of cars on each train,” Matkin said.
This will mean trains with fewer seats available in the near term — less than half as many coach seats as normal in some cases. How long it will take for Amtrak to return to full seating capacity on the line is unclear.

(John Moore/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A divide between rural Nebraska lawmakers is rustling in the statehouse. 
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, in west-central Nebraska, has proposed a bill that would exempt a significant sector of agriculture in the state — feedlots — from branding and inspection fees under the state’s livestock branding law that she has said she aims to “modernize” with Legislative Bill 646.  
“LB 646 simply provides an exemption for [feedlots], so [they] are treated uniformly across Nebraska,”  Ibach said during the bill Agriculture Committee hearing.
She has faced opposition from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a freshman rural lawmaker from north-central Nebraska who proposed an amendment to essentially kill the bill and let lawmakers make a more informed decision later regarding one of the state’s biggest industries. Her reason: Most lawmakers don’t deal with cattle. 
“The reality is there’s only about four in this body of 49 that understand that,” Storer said. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., generating $13.2 billion from cattle and other livestock, according to the latest tally from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Parts of that industry are regulated by the Nebraska Brand Committee, which is tasked with investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold or moved in or beyond the brand zone in state law, essentially covering the western two-thirds of the state. Its services are funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. 
The divide on the Ibach bill is that it would exempt feedlots in the state’s brand inspection area from paying branding-related fees, replacing them with a one-time payment of $500 to apply for feedlots to get exempt status. The Brand Committee called the legislation an attempt to “severely” weaken the cattle industry’s checks and balances, and several cattle industry groups have opposed it.
‘Invitation for abuse’ 
During the bill’s hearing before the Agriculture Committee, Nebraska Farmers Union president John Hansen said the Brand Committee provides security from cattle theft. He added the whole state should be under the Livestock Brand Act because the areas not in the branding area are an “invitation for abuse.”

“If I were stealing cattle, I know that I would be trying to sell them in the area of the state that does not have brand inspection,” Hansen said. “So the viability of the system will be undermined if this bill goes forward as is.” 
The Nebraska State Dairy Association testified in support of the bill and requested its own exception from the state Livestock Brand Act, calling the system a time and economic burden on the dairy industry because the branding committee hasn’t updated its ID Program. 
“Our producers are tired of waiting for the change to pay for a program that has no value to our industry,” said Steve Wolfe, who testified on behalf of the Nebraska State Dairy Association.
Bill sponsors initially included all eight of the Legislature’s Agriculture Committee members, though only six of the eight voted it out of committee for a floor debate: two original sponsors, State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and Dan McKeon of Amherst withdrew their names from the bill last week. Jacobson said it because his constituents won’t like it. 
“The only reason I signed on to begin with was to try to get to the point where we could negotiate something better than what we have today,” Jacobson said. “Every email and phone call I’ve gotten on this issue, except from the feed yards who stand directly to benefit, have been not only no but hell no. That’s a pretty strong message.”
Nebraska’s quirky branding law
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. In those states, it’s not mandatory but encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. 
Elliott Dennis, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln professor of livestock marketing and risk management, said Nebraska’s cattle branding approach is unique because some parts of the state don’t have to deal with the inspection fees. 
Dennis said the quirk is because areas in the eastern parts of the state have fewer cattle than most of western Nebraska. He said consumers wouldn’t feel the proposed changes to the branding law. 
Feedlot owners and beef and dairy cattle growers tried but failed in 2020 and 2021 to comprehensively update state branding laws. Dennis said feedlot owners have historically been against brand inspection due to the frequency of fees they must pay based on their cattle numbers and because getting an inspector can slow down production. 
He said who proposed the bill tells a lot about its intention. 
“This isn’t a person unfamiliar with the cattle industry,” Dennis said.
Explaining her stance
Ibach, a first-term senator, is married to the longest-serving state agriculture director Greg Ibach. She and her family own a cattle operation in Dawson County. She said the legislation is about updating the state brand law, not getting rid of it.

“To be clear, [the] bill does not do away with brand inspection inside the brand area, nor does it impact anyone’s ability to own or use a brand,” Ibach said. 
In an op-ed last month on KRVN Rural Radio’s website in Lexington, Ibach said she worked with the Nebraska Brand Committee and the Nebraska Farm Bureau after the bill’s Agriculture Committee hearing to add amendments to address the concerns from the committee, farm bureau, and other groups. 
“I believe the amendment addresses legitimate concerns raised by the testifiers and others,” Ibach wrote. 
Her amendment, AM 829, to LB 646, would cap the amount the Brand Committee can charge feedlots. 
Currently, the committee can charge for each additional increment of 250 cattle above the total of 1,000 cattle, which represents the lot’s one-time capacity. Feedlots are charged a $1,000 annual permit. If the bill becomes law, it’s estimated the committee would lose $1.6 million annually, roughly 25% of its operating budget. 
Discussions continue
Nebraska Farm Bureau Senior Director of State Legislative Affairs Bruce Rieker said the Bureau’s stance on the bill could change as negotiations between stakeholders in the cattle industry continue. 
“There are very sincere conversations going on between many of the parties now, Rieker said. “Much more so now than maybe they were earlier in the session.” 
On Tuesday, the Farm Bureau released a statement expressing disapproval of the amendment to the bill, signaling that it still opposes the changes.  
“For more than 80 years, the Nebraska Brand Committee has played a vital role in overseeing livestock brand registration, enforcement, and proof of ownership.” The statement reads, “We support the work of the Brand Committee and believe the Committee should have the fee authority necessary to adequately fund its programs.”
Nebraska Cattlemen also expressed continued opposition to the bill. Still, the group said it would “remain committed to working with Senator Ibach toward a solution that could be acceptable to the membership as we work to modernize brand laws in Nebraska.” The statement said the Cattleman Board of Directors would meet Tuesday to discuss and take a stance on the agriculture committee amendment.
Storer announced an amendment late last week to Ibach’s bill that would delay immediate action on the bill and call for a study by the Nebraska Brand Committee for potential solutions. Storer said she was “frustrated” with how the bill was initially crafted without the input of the Brand Committee and the cattle industry. She said her amendment was reasonable and would give more parts of the cattle industry a say. 
“I believe it is vitally important that we have an agency in place to provide oversight that prevents fraud and theft in that industry,” Storer told the Nebraska Examiner. “So at the end of the day, anything that’s going to weaken that agency…to prevent fraud and theft is problematic.”  
The legislation is set to be debated on the floor Wednesday.

(OIT/NJ Governor’s Office)State budget experts warned lawmakers on Tuesday of widespread uncertainty as the state moves to enact a budget for the coming fiscal year.
Though officials from the Treasury and the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services expressed optimism about revenue collections in the current fiscal year, which have exceeded expectations, they warned a tightening economy and residents’ response to it could lead to a revenue slowdown in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
“While the broader state economy remains on stable footing, volatility in capital markets, shifting consumer behavior, and potential policy shifts could adversely impact revenue collections,” Oscar Mendez, a revenue and economic policy analyst with the Office of Legislative Services, told the Senate Budget Committee.
The office estimated $55.33 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, about $456.5 million higher than Treasury’s own projections, with the differences mostly attributed to strong collections from the state’s pass-through business alternative income tax in the weeks after Treasury issued its estimates.
Stronger collections could ease the impact of the $1.2 billion structural deficit Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed for the upcoming fiscal year by expanding the state’s reserves, which are spent down when state expenditures outpace state revenue.
Legislators will receive another update on state revenue reflecting April tax filings in May. That update is expected to have positive news for lawmakers because markets were strong in the 2024 tax year despite the recent tumble fueled by President Trump’s tariff policies.
 Sen. Paul Sarlo (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“We’re going to need those revenues. Any April surprises, we’re going to need them for next year,” said Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate budget chairman.
Though the previous stock market hum may be a comfort to the state budget in the coming fiscal year, staggering drops across U.S. markets — including the S&P 500’s worst quarter since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 — could signal a potentially steep decline in income tax collections in the near future.
“Whenever the financial markets suffer, you can assume that there will be an echo in our revenue collections,” said Thomas Koenig, the legislative budget and finance officer.
Uncertainty around federal funding — particularly on the $14 billion in federal dollars New Jersey receives for Medicaid — could also upend the state’s budget.
The future of Medicaid is particularly troubling not only because it sees an outsized share of federal spending but also because those federal funds are often paid to reimburse expenditures already made using state funds.
The fact that many federal cuts have been issued on short notice or even retroactively compounds uncertainty at the state level, said Treasurer Liz Muoio.
“It is very difficult, A, to predict what’s coming through because it’s coming piecemeal, but then it’s coming in and it’s immediate,” she said. “So when you are dealing with this on a reimbursement level, you’ve already spent that money, so the potential hit to our budget and our programs, I should say, could be drastic.”
Legislators continued to express skepticism about some of the revenue raisers Murphy has proposed for the coming fiscal year, with particular resistance to a sales tax expansion that would tax services at laser tag arenas, swimming pools, and speedways, among a host of other recreational businesses.
“I want to make it clear to everybody who’s listening to this. There’s no desire from this Legislature to tax those services,” Sarlo said. “I think they were a talking point by the governor. I think the governor realizes those will be eliminated.”
Sarlo added he hopes revenue foregone by eliminating the expansion could be made up through governmental efficiencies or spending cuts.
Public pans spending cuts, tax hikes in governor’s budget plan

Health benefits for public workers are also set to be a major cost driver in the coming fiscal year. The local part of the State Health Benefits Program is projected to see total cost increases of more than 20% for 2026, before even considering increases in the cost of health benefits.
Municipalities have increasingly moved off the state plan amid steep cost increases in recent years, feeding a cycle where a smaller and increasingly less healthy pool of subscribers leads to cost increases that spur more departures.
“There is no doubt that the rate increases our plans have experienced in the past four years outpace what other, similar state and public employers are experiencing, especially in the SHBP local government section,” Muoio said.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The Senate has signed off on a bill that would target out-of-state health care providers and others who send abortion-causing medication to people in West Virginia, except in the few circumstances when it’s legal. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 85 with a vote of 28 to 5 and 1 person absent. The bill would make it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal.
In West Virginia, abortion is illegal except for medical emergencies and in cases of rape and incest. Abortion via telehealth is also illegal. 
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, a sponsor of Senate Bill 85, said the “important legislation is designed to protect life in West Virginia and stop the practice of abortifacients being sent and delivered to West Virginia residents without a lawful prescription.”
The penalty for violating the law would be three to 10 years in prison for a person who is not a licensed medical professional. Licensed medical professionals would face the revocation of their license, according to the bill. 
The Senate on Monday adopted an amendment from Rucker that allows a pregnant woman in West Virginia who receives an abortifacient to sue the sender and requires circuit courts to award injunctive relief and damages of $10,000 for each abortion that results. It clarifies that a person need not be indicted or convicted in order to pursue civil remedies. 
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, was one of five no votes on the legislation. Tarr said private causes of action like what is in the bill dissuade companies from locating in the state. Senators had also adopted Tarr’s amendment that allows a public cause of action — the attorney general pursuing civil penalties of $150,000 per offense. 
“Had the private cause of action, the job killer in this bill, not been in here, man, I’d have been the biggest champion for this bill,” Tarr said. “I’d have been all over it. Because we can still come back and do this without making this mistake. Because if you want young families having babies over here in West Virginia, we need jobs, Mr. President.”
Rucker said the private cause of action in the bill is not unique to West Virginia’s legislation. It’s a deterrent for people wishing to ignore state law, she said. 
“This legislation does not further expand abortion restrictions,” Rucker said. “It does not create new law regarding abortion, it is enforcement of the existing law that West Virginia legislators have supported and voted for in the past. So just like we have lots and lots of laws in the books, we expect those laws to be followed. What this legislation does is give a pathway for enforcement.”
An attorney for the Senate Judiciary committee told lawmakers that federal courts are likely to decide the issue of criminal penalties for bills like this one. 
Louisiana last month charged a New York doctor with a felony for allegedly sending abortion pills to a pregnant minor in the state, according to reporting by the Associated Press.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused to extradite the doctor to face the charges. New York has a shield law to protect abortion providers who prescribe the medication to patients in states where abortion is outlawed.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, was another of the five no votes on the bill. Garcia said the legislation chips away at people getting health care in West Virginia.  
Health care providers testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the state’s existing abortion ban makes it difficult for patients to get access to drugs like misoprostal, one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, which is also used to manage hemorrhaging and treating a miscarriage. The bill would make it even more difficult to access the medications, Kelly Lemon, a nurse midwife, testified.
“This is just muddying the waters and making it harder to be a medical professional in the state of West Virginia,” Garcia said. “And it’s another step back. And yeah, there are going to be job losses, not because of trial lawyers, but because of the fact that we’re doing something again to just hurt the people of the state of West Virginia.”
The bill next goes to the House of Delegates for consideration.

(Photo by Justin Garcia / Las Cruces Bulletin)New Mexico on Tuesday joined a multi-state lawsuit against the Trump administration in Rhode Island federal court challenging billions in lost funding to state health departments — including about $60 million to New Mexico.
The U.S. The Department of Health and Human Service last week announced it was pulling $11 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 era grants for infectious disease research, along with $1 billion in cuts for federal grants in mental health and substance use.
The New Mexico Department of Health told Source NM the federal cuts will not affect its measles programs, but confirmed on Monday the estimated $60 million in lost funding impacted 37 temporary contract staff positions.
“​​We are using state and federal funds to cover all other positions to ensure public health services for New Mexicans are not interrupted,” Nott said in a written statement. “The loss of the grant money has led to the cancellation of some contracts, but nothing that will impede our efforts to deal with the measles outbreak. We are still evaluating the potential impact of the cancellation of those contracts.”
“Our goal is to continue to provide needed public health services for New Mexicans, and we remain confident we will be able to do so despite this challenge,” Nott said.
Nott deferred comment on the lawsuit to the New Mexico Department of Justice.
In a Tuesday news release announcing the suit, the New Mexico Department of Justice said funding loss would jeopardize state vaccine programs for school enrollment, testing, disease prevention and infectious disease treatments.
“Cuts to HHS will have a devastating impact on our state, slashing critical funding for infectious disease research and response,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “At a time when measles cases are on the rise, restricting these resources endangers public health and weakens our ability to prevent outbreaks and protect our communities.”
According to the lawsuit, DHHS informed states the infectious disease grants were canceled immediately and no longer necessary “now that the pandemic is over.”
The funding cuts for the mental health grants used nearly identical language, the suit noted, but said they had been terminated “to reduce the overall federal spending.”
The notices from the federal government did not include any allegations of misspending or other graft, which is required to cancel them, according to the complaint.
The cuts to grants, some of which extended into 2027, occurred simultaneously with the announcement that the agency would lay off 10,000 federal public health employees.
The attorneys general requested a judge order the federal government to reinstate the funding, arguing the sudden federal budget cuts were unlawful and would cause “irreparable harm.”
Some of the states in the lawsuit described the impact the lost grants would have, such as a 12% reduction in workforce in Minnesota and $2 billion in lost funding in California.
In a statement Tuesday, Attorney General Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, who is co-leading the lawsuit, characterized the cuts as “massive and egregiously irresponsible” and said they “should put everyone on high alert to the depths this Administration is willing to go. First and foremost, Americans expect their government to protect them from harm. By eliminating billions in critical funding for essential public health initiatives, the Administration is effectively telling the American people to fend for themselves.”

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Tuesday unanimously approved a $3.7 billion General Fund budget for 2026 on Tuesday morning, a $347.9 million (10%) increase over the current year’s budget.
The House Ways and Means General Fund Committee’s approved budget is about $6 million higher than Gov. Kay Ivey’s recommendation. Chairman Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, said the proposed budget reduced Alabama Medicaid by $5 million and the Alabama Department of Mental Health’s allocation by $3.7 million. 
Reynolds said the decrease was removing one-time appropriations to those agencies that are no longer needed.

“Don’t read anything into that. They absolutely still need the money,” Reynolds said. “We just worked with those agencies and we’ll spread that allocation out over 2026 and 2027.”
The representative said most of those funds came from COVID appropriations that are going away, but the state would likely increase those agencies’ budgets next year.
The Department of Commerce’s budget will be cut by $10 million from 2025 to 2026. The committee substitute and Ivey’s recommendation cut funding for every line item under the department completely except for the Port of Mobile. That appropriation decreased from $5 million to $3 million.
“We anticipate that to be an annual line item going forward in our General Fund budget,” Reynolds said. 
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, brought up the $350,000 difference in the budgets for each of the legislative chambers. The Alabama Senate is set to receive $300,000 for reapportionment litigation expenses.
“I’m just trying to get an understanding why, if the budget starts here, why do they get more?” McCampbell asked.
Reynolds said that it was no different than the 2025 budget. He said the additional $300,000 is for the congressional redistricting trial. He said the funds could be used for paying attorneys or for a potential settlement.
“When they come out of that, we may have to redraw them and there’s a big cost associated with that,” Reynolds said in an interview. 
HB 186 is expected to receive a vote in the House on Thursday, House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)One member of the public said the bill is “nothing short of tyrannical,” but the sponsor and a planner said it will help counties resolve zoning when numerous districts create an administrative challenge.
Monday, the Senate Local Government committee unanimously passed House Bill 614 on a voice vote, and Chairman Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, said he believes it’s a good bill.
The problem, as described by supporters, is zoning districts initiated by residents, or “part one” districts, can start piling up in a county.
When residents want certain standards in place, commissioners may create a “part one” district” when 60% of the property owners in an affected area, as small as 40 acres, petition for one.
Each one might have its own definition and administrative standards.
“I think there’s a lot of these ‘part one’ districts that kind of get abandoned, and there’s no real way in statute right now for a county to clean those up,” Sen. Mandeville said.
For example, bill sponsor Rep. Greg Overstreet, R-Stevensville, told the committee last week it used to be “quite the rage” for citizens to petition and create their own districts in a county.
But counties don’t have a way to terminate “zombie zoning districts,” and they become a patchwork that’s difficult to manage, he said.
“Now, we have, for example in Ravalli County, 48 zoning districts, and they don’t match up with countywide zoning,” said Overstreet, who also credited Mandeville with the idea for the legislation.
But Kendra Keating, who lives in the Spring Hill district in Gallatin County, said she moved there specifically because of its protections.
She said it scares her to think the state could give the county authority to take away the interests of the citizens who came together to form the district.
“The way this is written, where we can completely lose everything that we have, doesn’t seem appropriate,” Keating said.
The bill came from the Montana Association of Planners, and at its hearing last week, it drew support from that organization and from a county commissioner.
However, roughly a dozen residents said the bill would negatively affect private property rights, and it would upend the ability of residents to manage development in a way they believe is best for their area.
For example, one resident said the district in which he lives is prone to fire, and the district takes wildfire into consideration.
The bill would give counties a way to terminate the zoning districts under a couple of circumstances, and it has earned a lot of support from legislators, although it lost some votes as it passed through the House.
In February, it passed unanimously out of the House Local Government committee. It initially passed 94-4 on the House floor, although it lost some support on third reading, with 80 yes votes and 19 against.
The bill would allow a board of county commissioners, after providing notice to the public of a hearing, to pass a resolution to terminate a zoning district under one of two circumstances.
It could do so if the county decided to comply with provisions of the Montana Land Use Planning Act.
Adopted in 2023, the Lane Use and Planning Act outlines steps, including public participation, for managing growth and development. It requires some cities to participate, and it allows other local governments to choose to comply.
The commissioners could also take action to dissolve a district if they’ve established a larger district that encompasses the land that’s up for termination.
Mandeville said the bill doesn’t allow county commissioners to strip a district of zoning altogether.
He said the fear is that commissioners will make a change that, for instance, suddenly allows a nuclear plant in a neighborhood, or completely undermines the interests of residents.
However, Mandeville said he doesn’t believe that’s realistic, especially given the public process.
He said the bill means counties can consolidate similar districts in a way that retains the unique characteristics of each, but also makes administration more straightforward.
“It would be unlikely that this process would be used to completely subvert what the ‘part one’ district had required,” Mandeville said.
At its hearing last week, the bill received harsh criticism from residents near Bozeman and a district in Gallatin County, who argued the benefits of the districts outweigh the administrative costs.
At least a couple of them suggested the process for terminating districts should remain in the hands of the citizens, and commissioners shouldn’t have the right to undo their work.
Deanna Campbell raises sheep and chickens on her land, she grazes a few head of cattle, and she said she likes the country life.
But Campbell said HB 614 is bureaucratic overreach, and it would affect people’s property taxes and their retirements, all without a vote by the people.
“To let elected officials change zoning without a vote, maybe just under pressure from developers or state mandates, is nothing short of tyrannical and a betrayal of Montana’s tradition of local control and citizen participation,” Campbell said.
“Please don’t let our country way of life become collateral damage to high density development and government overreach.”
Wendy Dickson, who described herself as a fifth generation Montanan and property owner in Gallatin County, said some local governments used to respect property rights, but now they even want to dictate who occupies a home.
Dickson asked legislators to respect the history of rural zoning and to keep self-governing powers with the people.
She suggested counties be allowed to initiate termination, but citizens retain the ultimate authority to do so.
“Unfortunately, it seems the Montana motto of ‘live and let live’ is now lost in some parts of our state where newcomers love Montana so much, they want to regulate everything,” Dickson said.
Charles Howe, who ranches in Spring Hill, said fire is a concern in the area, fueled by winds that blow into the valley.
He said the zoning residents worked on, in place for decades, takes the fire and the landscape into consideration.
Howe said he hopes anything the legislature passes will maintain similar protections to avoid blazes such as the Palisades fire in California.
Monday, Mandeville said he considered amendments to the bill, but did not see one that would address everyone’s concerns.
He also said he believes county commissioners won’t terminate a district if citizens have bought into it.
At the hearing last week, Ross Butcher, a commissioner from Fergus County representing the Montana Association of Counties, spoke in support of the bill.
Butcher said the bill offers a straightforward process to allow commissioners to end districts when commissioners are seeking a more comprehensive approach or if a county intends to opt into the Land Use Planning Act.
Sean O’Callaghan, with the Montana Association of Planners and Gallatin County, said the bill doesn’t cut out the public because it allows for a public process.
O’Callaghan said it’s challenging, time consuming and expensive for counties to maintain all the different zoning regulations that operate independently, with different definitions and administrative standards.
“Counties are looking for solutions to this situation,” O’Callaghan said.
He said HB 614 allows counties to combine new zoning regulations over the top of existing ones, then dissolve old ones, and it is a simple solution.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) At a press conference Tuesday, Rep. Megan Srinivas, D-Des Moines, said her colleagues on both sides of the aisle have concerns with a bill that would protect pesticide companies from certain lawsuits. 
Senate File 394, advanced from the Senate Floor last week and now awaits action from the House. 
Srinivas, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee where the bill will likely be assigned, said the potential correlation between glyphosate, the chemical in the popular pesticide Roundup, and cancer is driving much of the unease with the bill. 
Srinivas said these issues have also been brought up by constituents at a series of bipartisan “cancer listening posts” held across the state. 
“It’s time that we say no to this bill,” Srinivas said. “That we say Iowans are far more important than anything else in the state. Cancer — it’s not a Republican issue, it’s not a Democrat issue, it’s an Iowan issue.”
The press conference was organized by Iowa Food & Water Watch and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, who have previously organized a rally in opposition to the bill. 
Ava Auen-Ryan, a community organizer with Iowa CCI said “hundreds” of Iowans have engaged in this issue this year because of the widespread impacts of cancer in the state and because “people don’t want Bayer writing the rules in our state.” 
Michaelyn Mankel with Iowa Food & Water Watch said the bill is “decisively unpopular” among Iowans.
Proponents of the bill argue it will stop expensive lawsuits from targeting pesticide companies that are following the labeling requirements outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
According to the lobbying group Modern Ag Alliance, which has sponsored advertisements across the state about the bill, Iowa farmers save an estimated $612 million in production costs by using glyphosate. Modern Ag Alliance alleges that without the bill, farmers would not have access to the popular pesticide.
Central to the bill is Bayer, the manufacturer and distributor of Roundup, who has already spent more than $10 billion settling lawsuits where plaintiffs allege the chemical gave them cancer. The company stands to benefit from the bill because it would stop plaintiffs from suing under “failure to warn claims,” but Bayer is not the only pesticide manufacturer that would benefit.
Jess Christiansen, the head of crop science and sustainability communications at Bayer, said the bill is “really about upholding the label and the process.” 
Bayer holds that Roundup, and glyphosate, are safe products subject to “rigorous” testing, and that testing bodies have found “no link” to cancer. 
Christiansen called the progress of the bill in Iowa “fabulous” and said Bayer applauds the Iowa Senate for its “support of the farmers and the state of Iowa.”
“We’re really hopeful that the House will keep it moving,” Christiansen said.
The bill must be eligible for debate on the House floor by Thursday, or meet an exception, to survive the legislature’s self-imposed, second “funnel” deadline.

U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled Alabama's AG cannot punish residents for aiding out-of-state abortion care. (Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Monday ruled that Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall cannot prosecute people who assist individuals seeking to leave the state to obtain abortion care.
U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson Monday ruled in a 131-page opinion that the AG’s threatened enforcement of the state’s criminal laws to prosecute those who assist individuals seeking to leave the state for abortion care violates both the First Amendment and the right to travel.
“At its core, this case is simply about whether a state may prevent people within its borders from going to another state, and from assisting others in going to another state, to engage in lawful conduct there,” Thompson repeated from his ruling in May denying the AG’s motion to dismiss and added, “The court now answers no, a state cannot.”

The lawsuit was filed by Yellowhammer Fund; WAWC, formerly the West Alabama Women’s Center; Alabama Women’s Center (AWC) in Huntsville and Dr. Yashica Robinson, after Marshall in 2022 publicly threatened to criminally prosecute those who assist women seeking to travel out-of-state to get an abortion under Alabama’s near-total abortion ban. Marshall’s office later defended his power to do so in a court filing in August 2023.

“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the filing stated.
Amanda Priest, a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, wrote in an email that “the office is reviewing the decision to determine the state’s options.”
Alabama has had an effective ban on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion rights protections in 2022.
Thompson ruled that the attorney general’s threats violated the plaintiffs’ clients’ right to travel. He said in the ruling that the right to travel includes the right both to move physically between states and to do what is lawful in those states, and prosecuting those who facilitate lawful out-of-state abortions would violate that right.
The court also found that the attorney general’s threatened enforcement of Alabama’s criminal laws imposes a content- and viewpoint-based restriction on speech, which violates the First Amendment.
“The attorney general has presented no other reason to deny the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim besides his attempt to invoke the Giboney exception, which, as stated, does not extend to speech in furtherance of lawful out-of-state conduct,” Thompson wrote.
The Giboney exception would restrict speech that is directly part of or essential to committing a crime.
“Since the attorney general’s threatened enforcement cannot meet strict scrutiny, the court will enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for this freedom-of-speech claim,” Thompson concluded.
Thompson, in his conclusion, cautioned against the implications of the attorney general’s threats, writing that it is “one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard.  It is another thing for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help.”
“If Alabama held the power its Attorney General asserts here, it is hard to envision a limiting principle besides what the Attorney General personally sees as permissible and impermissible,” he wrote.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, left, and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, answered questions from reporters after a roundtable at Beck’s Hybrids in Colfax, Iowa, on March 31, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.
Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

Enrique Sanchez, shown during budget debates at the Rhode Island State House in 2024. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current) The criminal case against a state lawmaker accused of driving under the influence in Cranston early February has been dropped. 
State prosecutors filed the dismissal in Providence County Superior Court Monday against Rep. Enrqiue Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, as a result of a recent guilty plea before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal over refusing a breathalyzer test. 
“As is common with first offense DUI cases, since the defendant admitted to the civil charge of refusing to submit to a chemical test at the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal, the state dismissed the criminal charge,” Timothy Rondeau, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.
The filing from the AG’s office, which took over prosecutorial duties in late February, also stated the prosecutors were unable to meet its burden at trial on driving under the influence “due to factual and legal issues.”
Sanchez, 28, was scheduled to appear in Providence County Superior Court Friday morning for a pre-trial conference, which has since been canceled.
Neither Sanchez nor his attorney, former Rhode Island House Speaker John Harwood, immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday.
The second-term lawmaker was arrested by Cranston Police on Feb. 3 after an officer spotted him behind the wheel of a 2017 Nissan Altima stopped at a green light on Reservoir Avenue at 3 a.m. Officers noticed a “strong odor of alcohol” coming from Sanchez, who allegedly had “bloodshot watery eyes,” according to his arrest report. 
Sanchez declined to take a field sobriety test and later refused a breathalyzer test. He “admitted that he did drink,” according to his arrest report. He was arraigned in Kent County District Court and released on $1,000 personal recognizance. 
He was charged in traffic court with civil citations of refusing a chemical test and failure to obey traffic control devices, to which he initially pleaded not guilty. Sanchez’s driver’s license was temporarily suspended by the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal, but he was allowed to travel to and from work under a conditional hardship license.

Kim Hammer, R-Benton, asks a question about House Bill 1489 on the Senate floor Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Youth organizations that promote diversity initiatives would be prohibited from receiving state grants under an appropriation bill approved by a legislative subcommittee Tuesday.
Senate Bill 362 states that grant money will not be awarded to an organization that “compels” a person to subscribe to an idea “in violation of Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” This would include any requirement that an individual is “inherently superior or inferior” depending on their race, sex, age, religion, national origin, or “other characteristic protected by federal or state law.”
Bill sponsor Sen. Kim Hammer, a Benton Republican, said during the Joint Budget Committee’s Special Language subcommittee meeting that it was important the grant funding goes to groups “that align with the educational goals of the governor and General Assembly.”
“Some of this language is borrowed … out of Senator Petty’s bill, because I think it’s good language that kinda identifies that we want youth organizations that are meeting in the afterschool setting to align with the educational goals of the state of Arkansas with any of the programs that they may initiate,” Hammer said.
The bill also lifts some language from the LEARNS Act of 2023, Hammer said, as far as “what’s allowable.”
Nonprofits affiliated with a broader, national organization that wish to receive youth organization funds must submit a memorandum of understanding signed by both that acknowledges the state-level organization intends to comply with the law’s provisions prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion policies. 
Legislators both in Arkansas and across the country have taken aim at DEI in public education in recent years. In a Joint Performance Review Committee meeting in 2023, Hammer questioned representatives of Arkansas Boys and Girls Club affiliates about the national organization’s directives on the use of pronouns and other DEI issues.
“The Boys and Girls Club has a longstanding tradition of being built on traditional values. We’d hate to see that lost to any ‘wokeism,’” he said in that meeting.
The LEARNS Act, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature education law, prohibited “indoctrination” by the Arkansas Department of Education or state public schools, while explicitly stating that the law did not ban the discussion of the ideas and history of the ideas otherwise banned or public policy issues that some might find disagreeable or offensive.
SB 362 would appropriate $4 million for youth organizations. Appropriation measures specify funding amounts but no money becomes available until approved by the Legislature through the Revenue Stabilization Act.
Only 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) organizations that have operated for at least five years, with “a record of financial stability,” can qualify for the grants, according to the bill. Those operating for less than five years can still qualify for the grants if they provide a financial plan and are in good standing with the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office. 
Regular afterschool programming and educational activities in specific categories would also be needed to qualify an organization for the grant funding; an organization would need to provide programming for four days a week, with a total of 12 hours, during the school year.
The organization would need to provide regular programming in two out of five categories to qualify for the grants as well: STEM (science, technology, engineering and math); academic support; goal setting and leadership activities; career exposure and workforce readiness; and community service opportunities.
The bill was accepted by the subcommittee with no audible dissents, and will go to the Joint Budget Committee next.

(Photo by Megan Gleason / Source NM)The man who lost a race for the New Mexico Legislature and went on to orchestrate a series of shootings on the homes of his political opponents will be sentenced this summer.
Solomon Peña is scheduled to receive his prison sentence at 9 a.m. on July 2 in Albuquerque, according to an order entered by U.S. District Judge Kea Riggs on March 21.
Peña ran as a Republican for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 2022 and lost in a landslide by more than 47 points.
A jury last month found Peña guilty of organizing a series of shootings that targeted the homes of four elected Democratic officials in December 2022 and January 2023 after he refused to accept defeat. No one was physically harmed in the attacks, but police found bullet holes in the buildings.
The jurors found Peña guilty of one count of conspiracy for his role in the shootings; four counts of interfering with the 2022 elections; three counts of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime; one count of using or carrying a machinegun during and in relation to a violent crime; and one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.
The Democratic Party of New Mexico on Monday pointed to Peña’s case after Republican leaders in New Mexico blamed a town hall meeting organized by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) for a weekend fire they believe is arson on the state GOP headquarters in Albuquerque.
The case against Peña is being handled by the federal Department of Justice’s Election Threats Task Force, which was created in the wake of the 2020 election to protect election workers from violence. 
Last month, U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined other Democratic senators to urge federal Attorney General Pam Bondi to continue the task force’s work.
“Given the recent disturbing personnel and policy decisions at the Department and the lack of transparency about the future of the Task Force, we request an immediate update on the status and activities of the Task Force, as well as what resources will be provided to ensure its important work continues so that election officials of both parties can safely administer our elections,” the senators wrote.
In their letter, they asked Bondi for an update on its status and activities by Monday.
A spokesperson for Luján said Tuesday that his office has not received a response.
The jury also found Peña guilty of three counts of solicitation to commit a violent crime for trying to hire — while incarcerated — two people to kill Demetrio Trujillo and Jose Louise Trujillo, a father-son duo who are co-defendants in the case against Peña and who accepted plea agreements last year.
Jose Louise Trujillo, who helped Peña’s election campaign, had been scheduled for sentencing on April 14, but his attorney asked Judge Riggs to delay his sentencing by a month. Online court records indicate Riggs entered an order responding to his request but the order itself was not posted online as of publication time.
Demetrio Trujillo is scheduled to be sentenced on May 21.
One of Peña’s victims, Debbie O’Malley, went on to become a state senator, and talked about her experience in the Roundhouse while she helped carry gun safety legislation.

(Photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY — An inmate who was transferred to Oklahoma last month to face the death penalty now has an execution date.
George John Hanson, also known as John Fitzgerald Hanson, is scheduled to die on June 12 for the 1999 murder of 77-year-old Mary Bowles. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on Tuesday set the execution date.
The state’s Pardon and Parole Board has a tentative date of May 7 for Hanson’s clemency hearing, executive director Tom Bates said.
Hanson, now 60, was convicted of kidnapping Bowles, a retired banker and well-known volunteer, from the parking lot of a Tulsa mall and shooting her to death at a dirt pit near Owasso. His accomplice, Victor Cornell Miller, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for killing a witness of the murder, bystander Jerald Max Thurman.
Attorneys for Hanson said the jury that sentenced him to death was unaware of evidence that Miller bragged about killing Bowles. Hanson’s lawyers didn’t investigate or present evidence of his autism and related impairments, his current attorneys said.
The Tulsa County district judge who presided over Hanson’s trial, Caroline Wall, wrote that she would have recommended a sentence of life without parole, according to a 2006 report. 
Miller took advantage of Hanson and roped him into a series of crimes, Hanson’s attorneys said.
“John Hanson is a peaceful prisoner whom correctional staff believe adds value to the prison community,” his attorney Emma Rolls said. “He poses no danger to anyone in prison. The jury that convicted him never knew that his co-defendant had bragged about being the real killer, and the trial judge herself felt this omission warranted a life sentence. These are exactly the kind of circumstances for which clemency is needed, to prevent an unnecessary and pointless execution.”

Attorney General Gentner Drummond requested that Hanson transfer to Oklahoma from a federal prison in Louisiana where he was serving a life sentence for an unrelated bank robbery.  
Hanson initially was scheduled for execution in 2022, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons, then under President Joe Biden’s administration, refused to move him to Oklahoma. 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi approved the transfer request on Feb. 13 after President Donald Trump ordered the federal government to comply with capital punishment sentences.
Hanson is now imprisoned at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.
“The monster who abducted and murdered a 77-year-old woman more than 25 years ago is finally set to pay for his crime,” Drummond said. “The family of Mary Bowles has waited many agonizing years for George John Hanson to be brought to justice, and on June 12, that day finally will come.”

Democrats unanimously backed the resolution, passing it along party lines with their two-vote majority. The resolution is a statement by the legislative body and has no impact on Minnesota laws or agencies. 
It did, however, put Republicans in an uncomfortable position, forcing them to take a position on the pardons, which were largely opposed by the American public — especially pardons for rioters who were convicted of assaulting police officers.
Twenty-two Republicans voted against the resolution; 10 GOP senators abstained.
“This is simply partisan political theater,” said Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, who voted no.
More than 1,500 people were convicted of crimes related to the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol after a rally in which Trump falsely claimed he won the election and encouraged attendees to walk towards the Capitol and “fight like hell.”
“And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said that day. 
Rioters then stormed the Capitol; interrupted the election certification process, forcing lawmakers into hiding; and injured 140 police officers. 
Minnesota Republicans Tuesday repeatedly turned the conversation to former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies and pardons, and Gov. Walz’s recent quips celebrating Tesla stock dropping in value.
Sen. Bill Weber, R-Luverne, introduced an amendment that would have condemned Walz’s comments about Tesla stock, rather than the Jan. 6 pardons.
“Any time that any elected official stands up and tries to affect the value of the stock, be it positive or negative, that is an inappropriate action,” said Sen. Glenn Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe. 
Republicans spent years decrying “woke” corporations, including Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch.
And in response to Tesla’s stock falling, Trump used the White House to show off Teslas, encouraged Americans to buy the cars and said he would buy one himself.
Sen. Eric Pratt, R-Prior Lake, said he condemned the violence committed on Jan. 6, but that he would abstain from voting on the resolution. 
“It’s interesting that we’re dealing with it on April Fools Day,” Gruenhagen said. “Maybe there’s a connection.”

(Molly Adams/Lawrence Times)TOPEKA — Former Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez told members of the Kansas Supreme Court on Tuesday that she “never in my craziest of nightmares” thought she would be standing before them at a disciplinary hearing.
Valdez, who lost a reelection bid last year, faces potential discipline for a news release and Facebook post in March 2021 that included a personal attack on a judge. During a 10-minute speech before the court on Tuesday, she described the “chaotic time” in which she took office.
She told justices she was “emotionally fragile” in 2021 because her brother had died from a drug overdose, her predecessor refused to help with the transition of power, and the district court — without her input — had decided to resume jury trials on her first day in office, even though COVID-19 vaccines were not yet widely available.
Douglas County District Judge James McCabria issued a news release that said the court had “consulted with all the stakeholders,” the Lawrence Times reported. Valdez wanted the public to know she wasn’t involved.
In a Facebook post, she wrote: “Women of the world- be prepared! If you are hardworking, outspoken, honest, AND in a position of authority, the INSECURE MAN will try to tear you down. Not me, says I!!”
On Tuesday, Valdez she should have taken the high road but was “petty” instead.
“I’m sorry. I apologize. I made a grave mistake when I allowed myself in my frustration and the turmoil and COVID and all the anxiety and all of that to get the better of me,” Valdez said. “That’s not who I am. I’m a very passionate person. I’m a very honest person. I am all those things, and I am sorry.”
She wiped away tears as she sat down, took a deep breath and stared at the notebook in front of her.

Five members of the court heard arguments from Kimberly Bonifas, a Wichita lawyer who prosecuted Valdez on behalf of the Office of the Disciplinary Administrator, and Stephen Angermayer, a Pittsburg lawyer who defended Valdez. Justice Evelyn Wilson, who plans to retire July 4, is not hearing any more cases, and Justice K.J. Wall recused himself.
Bonifas had argued that Valdez should lose her license, but a three-member disciplinary panel recommended she face public censure instead, leaving a blemish on her record that could limit a lawyer’s professional career. Angermayer asked for an informal admonishment instead.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Justices Caleb Stegall and Dan Biles questioned the legitimacy of an ethics rule that prohibits “undignified or discourteous conduct” by an attorney that is “degrading” to a court.
Bonifas said personal comments about a judge would be inappropriate even in a closed-door meeting, let alone a public news release and social media post.
Stegall said the rule in question has to do with “big ideas,” like maintaining the integrity of the judicial system. But even if Valdez’ comments were “stupid and foolish,” he said, “does it really serve the legitimacy and integrity of the judicial branch to punish speech that we find offensive?”
“It just strikes me that we potentially do more harm than good when we punish speech,” Stegall said.
Bonifas said Valdez could have criticized the judge without resorting to “petty criticism” and name-calling.
Stegall’s response: “Is it wise to punish petty criticisms? Doesn’t that make us look petty?”

Biles asked how the violation in question could survive a First Amendment test, especially since it was about an individual judge and his press release and not about an adjudication. And he said Valdez’ comments were “off-campus,” meaning on Facebook, rather than in a court proceeding.
“What’s the government interest in preventing a lawyer from criticizing a judge?” Biles said.
Bonifas argued that Valdez harmed the public. She said the judge was speaking on behalf of the court and was trying to educate the public about the court’s plan to address health and safety concerns. That communication was met with name-calling that left members of the public “appalled,” Bonifas said.
Justice Eric Rosen said “we seem to be forgetting” that courts in 2021 were struggling to figure out how to protect constitutional rights while dealing with a public health crisis.
“When we were in the throngs of that stuff, we were desperate to try to get just the process going to meet all of the needs of both prosecutors’ offices, defense counsel and criminal cases and just all cases,” Rosen said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250401-Valdez-oral-arguments-13-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-01 15:06:33.836981

The Oklahoma Opioid Abatement Board is preparing to give out a new round of grants to statewide applicants. Soon, local governments will be able to take a bid at $29 million designated to address the opioid crisis.
Applications for a chunk of the money will open May 12 and run through June 11. All Oklahoma counties, municipalities, public school districts, technology school districts and public trusts are eligible to apply.
Housed in the Attorney General’s Office, the Opioid Abatement Board (OAB) is one of the state’s mechanisms for addressing the opioid crisis that has plagued Oklahoma over the last decade.
Funds won from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors are appropriated to the board by the state Legislature. The board is then responsible for choosing how to distribute the money from the Opioid Abatement Revolving Fund.
Board members Dr. Atul Walia, Dr. Kelly Dunn and Carol Bush have volunteered to be part of the subcommittee that will review the next round of applications.
Where did the last round of grants go?
So far, the OAB has awarded over $12 million in grants throughout the state.
The money the board has already distributed is divided among 85 different grantees. Grants ranged from almost $20,000 to $700,000, with the largest sum awarded to a joint application from the City of Tulsa and Tulsa Public Schools. The second largest grant of $600,000 went to Tulsa County.

Of the 85 political subdivisions awarded money, 15 were granted funds only after making edits to their initial proposals. The board reported it received more than 100 grant applications in total, despite more than 250 groups initially expressing interest.
Each grant proposal looked different, but had to address one of the board’s approved uses, including treatment and recovery programs, opioid abuse education, naloxone training and distribution and mental health care.
Terry Simonson, special counsel to the Attorney General, said around 1,400 political subdivisions are eligible to apply for grants. Still, many don’t have dedicated grant writers or available staff to put together a proposal for the money.
He said these barriers have deterred some potential applicants.
“Probably the most common reason,” Simonson said, “was, ‘I don’t know what we need, so how do I know what to ask for?’”
Simonson said the board is updating its website for the next grant cycle, adding answers to commonly received questions and resources about how to complete a needs assessment.
Still, he said he’s proud of the impact initial community investments have already made.
“Six months ago, there wasn’t anyone sitting here who said, ‘I’ve been hired to work in the opioid space for my county,’ and now you’ve got several of them,” Simonson said during the most recent OAB meeting. “That’s where we got to go. I need some generals on the ground.”
What’s different about this round of grants?

	
During the first round of grants, the legislature appropriated $23 million to the OAB, of which the board awarded $12 million.
Dr. Kelly Dunn, who helped decide which projects to spend the money on, said she hopes the board will be able to give out more this go-around.
“We’d love to give all $29 million out if there’s appropriate projects applied for,” Dunn said.
She said the board will now accept proposals that extend over three years. Previously, only one-year projects (that could be spent over two years) qualified for grant money.
Depending on its population size, each applicant will also be able to apply for three times as much money as before.
Bill to expand uses, eligible applicants

	
A bill expanding the authority of the board and its decision-making capacity cleared its first legislative hurdle earlier this month.
Requested by the Attorney General’s Office, Senate Bill 574 expands uses for grant money and adds colleges and universities to the list of eligible applicants. The bill passed with a 39-7 vote in the Senate and can now be considered by the House of Representatives.
If adopted, the board can establish new criteria to determine how grants are disbursed – an expansion from previous considerations, which included metrics like the number of opioid-related deaths in a given area.
The bill would also allow the board more flexibility in spending. It opens up funds to approved uses authorized by opioid-related settlement agreements involving the state and earmarks 10% of funds for statewide projects.
“The genesis of this bill is lessons learned from when we deployed the first time,” AG Gentner Drummond said. “We had $20 million and we didn’t get it all deployed; how can we make it more effective, more efficient for us and give staff the opportunity to touch more lives?”

GOP leaders opted to cancel votes for the rest of the week afterward.“People have emotional reasons for doing what they’re doing,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the failed vote. “But we’re going to keep governing. This is a small, razor-thin majority and we have to build consensus on everything. I wish they had not taken this course, but we’re not shaken by this.”The discharge petition from Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna and Colorado Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen received signatures from 218 lawmakers, indicating it has the support needed to change the House’s rules when a vote is held.Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick, New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, New York Rep. Michael Lawler, Ohio Reps. Michael Rulli and David Joyce, Pennsylvania Rep. Daniel Meuser, Tennessee Reps. Tim Burchett and Andy Ogles and Texas Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Wesley Hunt were the Republicans who signed the discharge petition.A newborn on the House floorPettersen, holding her newborn in her arms, urged House lawmakers to ensure that women who cannot travel to the Capitol due to their pregnancies and new parents can still represent their constituents.“When I was pregnant, I couldn’t fly towards the end of my due date because it was unsafe for Sam, and you’re unable to board a plane,” Pettersen said during floor debate. “I was unable to actually have my vote represented here and my constituents represented.”“After giving birth I was faced with an impossible decision: Sam was four weeks old and for all of the parents here we know that when we have newborns it's when they’re the most vulnerable in their life, it’s when they need 24-7 care, when taking them even to a grocery store is scary because you're worried about exposure to germs and them getting sick — let alone taking them to an airport, on a plane and coming across the country to make sure you’re able to vote and represent your constituents.”Pettersen said she was “terrified that no matter what choice” she made about whether to vote in-person, she would have “deep regrets.”“So Sam and I made the trip out and this is our third time coming to the floor for a vote,” she said. Pettersen said it was “unfathomable that in 2025” Congress had not modernized to have basic parental leave and said the institution has “a long ways to go to make this place accessible for young families like mine.”Luna said she had spent years trying to convince Republican leaders to allow new parents to vote by proxy. But after exhausting all of her options, worked with her colleagues to gather signatures for a discharge petition.“Now, leadership, because of the fact they don’t like that I was successful at this, is trying to change the rules,” Luna said, calling GOP leaders’ choice “fundamentally dangerous.”‘A new laptop class in America’Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, ranking member on the Rules Committee, said Republican leadership was ""trying to overturn the Democratic process of majority rule.""""When 218 of us sign a petition, the House rules say it can be brought up for a vote,"" McGovern said. ""But a backdoor provision slipped into this rule is being used to shut down that process — an unprecedented step. Literally, it has never been done before in the history of the House.""House Rules Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., opposed moving forward with the discharge petition and a floor vote on proxy voting.“I know there’s a new laptop class in America that seems to operate increasingly in a virtual space, but that’s simply not a fact of life for most American workers and I believe Congress should live by that standard,” Foxx said.Members of Congress, including dozens of Republicans, voted by proxy during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaker Johnson has also allowed discharge petitions to move forward before. Just last year Congress cleared a bill making changes to Social Security benefits for some Americans after members from both political parties signed a discharge petition.Tuesday’s measure, titled Proxy Voting for New Parents Resolution, would allow House members who just gave birth, or had a spouse give birth, to designate another lawmaker to vote on their behalf for 12 weeks.The resolution would also allow House lawmakers to vote by proxy before giving birth if their health care providers advised the “pregnancy presents a serious medical condition or that she is unable to travel safely.” The legislation would not affect the Senate. Generally, each chamber of Congress sets its own rules and does not try to tell the other chamber how to operate.Luna quits Freedom CaucusLuna left the far-right Freedom Caucus on Monday over the group's efforts to block her discharge petition from moving forward, writing in a two-page letter that “the mutual respect that has guided our caucus” for years was “shattered last week.”“This was a modest, family-centered proposal,” Luna wrote. “Yet, a small group among us threatened the Speaker, vowing to halt floor proceedings indefinitely — regardless of the legislation at stake, including President Trump's agenda — unless he altered the rules to block my discharge petition.”Luna rebuked several of the Freedom Caucus members, without naming names. She said their choice to try to block the discharge petition from moving forward by embedding language in a rule that set up debate on a separate bill was duplicitous.“This tactic was not just a betrayal of trust; it was a descent into the very behavior we have long condemned — a practice that we, as a group, have repeatedly criticized leadership for allowing,” Luna wrote. “To those involved, I ask: Why? Why abandon the principles we've championed and resort to such conduct?“The irony in all of this is that I have never voted by proxy, yet one of our own on the Rules Committee that is so adamantly opposed has done so over 30 times.”",,,,2025-04-01 15:06:33.836981

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A private prison company aiming to open a massive immigration detention center in Newark is renovating the building without securing proper permits, has barred city inspectors from entering the facility, and is flouting city code to finish construction, Newark officials allege in legal documents filed Tuesday. 
Geo Group’s “wanton and unlawful occupation” of Delaney Hall — the building where the company plans to open the east coast’s largest migrant jail by this summer — exposes Newark to potential liabilities, the city says in a nine-page complaint filed in state Superior Court in Essex County. 
“The city will suffer greater harm if not permitted to inspect the property than defendants will suffer if delayed in their use of the building pending inspection and compliance,” city attorney Morrison Kent Fairbairn wrote in the complaint. 
The filing comes one day after Newark engineering officials issued a stop-work order to halt all construction on the site. 
“As I have stated in the past, without compliance with requirements, Delaney Hall cannot lawfully open,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who opposes plans to open the new immigrant jail, said in a statement. “We will not tolerate federal attempts to ignore or evade our laws and statutes, which apply to everyone.” 
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it signed a 15-year contract with Geo Group to house immigrant detainees at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility located next to the Essex County jail. ICE officials said the detention center would help manage the influx of migrants arrested and detained under President Donald Trump, who recaptured the White House in January after pledging a mass deportation effort. 
Immigrant advocates have protested Geo Group’s plans, with Baraka — who is one of six Democrats running for governor — joining activists in their calls to keep the jail from opening. He told reporters at a protest in March that he’d padlock the building to block its opening if Geo Group didn’t obtain the proper approvals. 
New Jersey has a state law barring private and public companies from contracting with ICE to house immigrant detainees, but a federal judge struck down part of the law pertaining to private companies in 2023. The state has appealed the ruling, and the appeal is scheduled to be heard in a few weeks.
On Monday, Newark officials told Delaney Hall’s director they’d visit the facility for inspections of the fire alarms and elevator functionality, but Geo Group staff stopped them from entering, according to the complaint. 
While inspectors weren’t allowed inside the facility, they saw electrical and plumbing work occurring outside despite no permit to do such work, which “creates a serious health risk,” the complaint says.
A Geo Group employee told city officials that the building is currently being used as a training facility, according to the complaint. But without certified and properly working elevators that pass inspection, the building is a “life safety hazard for every occupant,” according to the complaint. 
City officials also note that HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and other systems have not been used in the building for years, and the city has had no way to check whether these are functional, the complaint says. Delaney Hall held immigrant detainees between 2011 and 2017.
It’s also unclear whether any upgrades are up to city and state code, considering no permit has been taken out, the city says. 
“The lack of an inspection presents an immediate and significant risk to life safety, including fire hazards due to improper electrical wiring, risk of electrocution due to unpermitted electrical work, insufficient plumbing which may yield to low water pressure and environmental issues due to improper disposal of wastewater and solid waste, inability to conduct an elevator recall in case of fire placing occupants at risk of injury during evacuation procedures, just to name a few hazards to the safety of the occupants,” city engineering director Dolores Martinez Wooden said in an affidavit. 
The city is asking a judge to order Geo Group officials to allow inspectors into the building, halt all construction, and comply with all local fire, health, and safety regulations. 
ICE and Geo Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Delaney Hall would be the state’s second private detention center for immigrants. Elizabeth Detention Center, which holds about 300 detainees, has been used as a processing center before people are deported or sent to other detention centers.
Fears are mounting about the potential of a third migrant lockup in New Jersey. In Union County, the board of commissioners has moved to sell its unused jail, fueling concerns from immigrant activists that it could become another detention center.

House Bill 193, “Firearm Law Revisions,” authorizes those with a valid concealed handgun permit (along with those who are exempt from the requirement to have a permit) to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school, according to the bill text.
Its primary sponsors are Reps. Jeffrey McNeely (R-Iredell), Reece Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), Charles Miller (R-Brunswick, New Hanover), and Todd Carver (R-Iredell).
  Rep. Jeff McNeely (Photo: ncleg.gov)
McNeely said that while the bill is currently broad, its objective is to allow security guards or others with training to provide reassurance in the event of a shooting at a private school.
“This would allow some of these smaller private schools… to have somebody that they designate to be able to add some layer of protection to them until the law enforcement can get there,” McNeely said.
As worded, the bill would allow anyone lawfully entitled to carry a concealed handgun — including a school official, teacher, or even a student — to carry it on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school.
The legislation’s impact could expand if either of two pending bills authorizing so-called “constitutional carry” — Senate Bill 50 or House Bill 5 — were to be enacted into law.
These bills would allow individuals 18 or older to carry concealed handguns without obtaining a permit, a deviation from current law. Senate Bill 50 has passed through the upper chamber and is now in the House, while House Bill 5 awaits another committee hearing in its original chamber.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) asked if the legislation is too broad, given that there are no requirements pertaining to training or background checks.
“What we’re hoping is this will allow for security guards who are not able, people who do have training, but they do not fall under law enforcement, to be able to be there on hand and hopefully offer some level of protection,” McNeely said.
The sponsor emphasized that the bill does not circumvent existing concealed carry laws in the state – security guards would need to have permits in order to carry concealed handguns.
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) pointed out that polling shows the bulk of North Carolina teachers do not favor guns in schools.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” she said. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
McNeely responded that the bill is not a requirement. While it allows private schools to employ these security guards, it does not make it mandatory.
The bill also includes a provision that would insulate certain law enforcement-operated shooting ranges from civil liability or criminal prosecution relating to noise or noise pollution.
House Bill 193 now heads to the House Education K-12 Committee for further debate.
Social media restrictions approved
The House Judiciary 2 Committee also voted to approve House Bill 301, “Social Media Protections for Minors Under 16,” moving the measure to the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee.
This legislation would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for children between the ages of 14 and 15.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GunsNJ-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 15:06:33.836981

Attorneys for a Baton Rouge woman facing eviction filed a lawsuit March 24 in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. They take issue with how local justices of the peace can supplement their budgets and salaries through the fees they charge for adjudicating evictions.
State law allows justices of the peace to charge defendants $120 for each eviction case they handle plus another $20 for each additional defendant. To execute the eviction, their courts receive $60 per case and another $20 per defendant. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The organizations suing Steven Sanders, an East Baton Rouge Parish justice of the peace, say he handles 300 to 400 evictions a week. They want their case designated as a class action to bring more tenants on board as plaintiffs. 
As of now, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Housing Law Project and New Orleans civil rights attorney William Quigley represent just one tenant: Latoria George, who currently faces eviction in Sanders’ court. 
Anjana Joshi, a Southern Poverty Law Center attorney representing George, sat in on other eviction cases Sanders handled to track his pace.
“He will often schedule [multiple] evictions filed by the same landlord for the same morning … and those will all be decided kind of in rapid succession,” Joshi said.
“What we observed was that often tenants don’t show up, so there’s a default judgment that Justice of the Peace Sanders signs,” she said. “Sometimes tenants do show up, and he may try to work out a payment plan with them. But when he does that, he still issues a judgment of eviction against them.” 
Sanders moved through cases without tenants in seconds, according to Joshi. When tenants did appear, “It could take, like, up to a couple minutes.” 
The seemingly expedited eviction process is at the heart of the lawsuit against Sanders, whose caseload generated nearly $2.7 million in court fee revenue between 2019-23 based on figures from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor.
The state attorney general’s office, which represents local justices of the peace in legal matters, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Reached by phone Monday, Sanders said he could not discuss the pending litigation under advisement from the attorney general. 
‘A very, very lucrative business’
Sanders’ total court expenses averaged less than $20,000 annually over that same period, leaving ample revenue for him to tap into to augment his base salary of around $5,000 a year that the state allocates. 
Sanders’ take-home pay from 2019-23 averaged $232,419 a year, making him the highest paid justice of the peace in East Baton Rouge Parish according to reports filed with the Louisiana Legislative Auditor. That places him well ahead of the average salaries for state district court judges ($173,788) and Louisiana Supreme Court justices ($193,227).
“It’s a very, very lucrative business,” said Hannah Adams, a plaintiff’s attorney with the National Housing Law Project. 
Sanders is not alone among Louisiana justices of the peace who churn out a high rate of evictions and see a corresponding increase in personal compensation. Three justices of the peace in Jefferson Parish were featured in a WDSU-TV report on their court revenue-boosted salaries. 

Kevin Centanni presided over 60 eviction cases in his Kenner district during one week in February. In 2023, he reported a total salary of $147,637, with $115,000 coming from fees. 
Vernon Wilty III, who presides over a West Jefferson justice of the peace court, added $202,543 in fees to his base pay of $24,134. 
Charles “Chuck” Cusimano II of Metairie reported his salary was $21,600 with an additional $327,588 in fee income .     

“If Judge Sanders or any of the other justices of the peace are dependent on the money that landlords pay them to file evictions, they have a financial incentive to get as many landlords as possible to file evictions,” Adams said. “And even more insidious, they have potentially a financial incentive to grant as many evictions as possible, because they get an extra $40 or so every time they grant an eviction.”
Landlords’ preferred venue  
There are nearly 400 elected justices of the peace in Louisiana. In addition to evictions, state law allows them to preside over auto repossessions, small claims cases and marriages. They don’t have to be lawyers, and their “courtrooms” can be based out of home offices and other nondescript places.
Instead of going before a justice of the peace, landlords can file eviction cases with city or state district courts. But the plaintiff’s attorneys say justices of the peace are their preferred venue because they don’t have to follow evidence rules. 
For example, a landlord could testify that a tenant is being evicted for excessive noise based on a neighbor’s complaints. A justice of the peace could accept the landlord’s word as fact, while the neighbor would be required to testify in district court.
Also, a tenant’s ability to appeal a ruling from a justice of the peace is limited. State district court decisions can be challenged all the way up to the Louisiana Supreme Court. But if an evicted tenant wants to appeal a justice of the peace ruling, they essentially have to start a new trial in district court because there are no records to review from the justice of peace. Plus, the district court’s ruling is final.
“The financial conflicts of interest that [are inherent] in justice of the peace courts and the unequal access to appellate rights granted to tenants in justice of the peace courts create a two-tiered system of justice in Louisiana,” the plaintiff’s attorneys argue in the lawsuit.
Due process and funding concerns
George’s legal team is leaning on two precedents in which the U.S. 5th Circuit ruled courts violated the constitutional right to due process when they funded their operations with fees and fines assessed against criminal defendants. 
In one case, appellate judges ruled against Orleans Parish Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell, who was running his court on non-reimburseable fees collected from bail bond businesses. The plaintiff’s attorney noted Cantrell frequently steered defendants to bondsmen, rather than accept cash. The judge also routinely set high bonds and advised accused parties not to seek lower ones, according to court records.
The other case found Orleans Parish Criminal District Court collected fines and fees from defendants for its Judicial Expense Fund. The 5th Circuit ruled the system violated defendants’ due process rights and presented a conflict of interest under the 14th Amendment.
It would take a change in Louisiana law to keep justices of the peace from dipping into their revenue accounts to pump up their salaries.
State Rep. Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, R-Houma, has been the most outspoken among lawmakers on the topic of judicial compensation. He has also been a critic of courts that rely on revenue that’s self-generated through punitive measures.    
“This speaks to the issue of how we fund the judicial process in Louisiana,” Zeringue said in an interview. “We need to get away from focusing on fines and fees to fund the essential parts of the judicial system.”  
Steven Procopio, head of the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, notes that any changes to the laws that dictate what fees justices of the peace collect could have a ripple effect on state resources. Denying access to the fees for salaries might also impact how these low-level courts pay for their operating costs.
“To address it though, it means you have to find other sources of revenue that aren’t fee-based. That usually means state funding,” Procopio said.

(Image by Getty Images)The Trump administration started withholding federal funding to health care providers in Maine on Tuesday under what’s known as Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
Grantees are eyeing legal action, as they say the freeze will limit essential care for tens of thousands of Mainers and amounts to a backdoor attack on reproductive rights, even though Title X does not fund abortion.
Family planning services include contraception, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, among others. Providers in the Title X network have never been able to use the funds for abortion services, however those who offer such services are eligible to receive and use the funds for family planning services. 
Maine Family Planning, Maine’s statewide grantee for Title X funding, received a notice from the Office of the Assistance Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Monday informing the organization that all of its Title X funding would be temporarily withheld beginning Tuesday, amounting to a total of $1.925 million, according to Maine Family Planning spokesperson Kat Mavengere.
George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, which distributes some of the funding to other providers in the state, said in a statement that any delay in the disbursement of federal grants will have a detrimental impact on patients. 
“Maine Family Planning’s funding application adheres to the current requirements of the Title X program and regulations, which encompass health equity,” Hill said. “As the statewide Title X grantee, we refuse to compromise expert care that Mainers have relied on for more than 50 years.”
Hill said the organization is prepared to fight back against attacks on its ability to serve Mainers, including litigating to defend the rights of the Title X family planning network.
Maine Family Planning and its subgrantees, including Planned Parenthood, serve roughly 31,000 patients across the state each year.
“Title X doesn’t even cover abortion funding, so this is a blatant attempt to push a political agenda and impose beliefs about health care on everyone,” Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, told Maine Morning Star. “And the truth is that Title X makes health care affordable for so many people who desperately need it.” 
The freeze equates to roughly $400,000 annually for Planned Parenthood in Maine, Margulies said. Last fiscal year, Planned Parenthood served 6,468 Title X patients in the state. 
Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood expected Title X funding to be restricted during President Donald Trump’s second term, given the limits he’d implemented during his last presidency. 
Previously, Trump barred providers from so much as mentioning abortion care to patients if they wanted to continue receiving the funding, what critics referred to as the “domestic gag rule,” which led Maine Family Planning to drop out of the Title X network. Former President Joe Biden reversed the rule in 2021.
“This is kind of a different flavor of attack than we’ve seen previously,” Margulies said, “but it gets at the same goal, which is to defund Planned Parenthood and defund abortion providers more generally.” 
These federal actions underscore the need for more state funding, Margulies said, pointing to the bill being considered by the Maine Legislature to increase state allocations for family planning services. 
During the first week of his second term, Trump also reinstated a global version of this gag rule, which prevents nongovernmental organizations that receive federal global health funding from providing access to abortion-related information and care. Maine’s congressional delegation reintroduced a bill to permanently repeal it.
Also this week, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing its first abortion case since Trump’s reelection to settle whether states can bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds — which could further the administration’s goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.

The conflict between the state of Maine and the Trump administration over transgender student athletes reached a new pivot point on Monday. As the first of several deadlines set by the federal government has now expired, whether Maine can continue to allow trans athletes to participate in sports appears likely to be decided by the courts.
Two separate federal agencies determined that Maine is in violation of Title IX based on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the anti-sex discrimination protection.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girls sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.
In a letter dated March 17, HHS had given Maine a deadline of 10 days to comply with federal guidance. Monday marked 10 business days from that warning.
Federal judge vacates Biden Title IX rule, scrapping protections for LGBTQ+ students nationwide

Both agencies determined that Maine had violated federal law after dayslong investigations that included no interviews, while typical investigations take months and are eventually settled with resolution agreements. The probes were launched after Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, and President Donald Trump had a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy. Millions of dollars in federal funding might be at risk, depending on how the cases proceed.
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast-tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the Education Department who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases.
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
On March 19, the Department of Education’s civil rights office notified Maine of its noncompliance and proposed a resolution agreement that would require the state to rescind its support for trans athletes, which is currently required by the Maine Human Rights Act. A Cumberland-area school district and the Maine Principals Association, which runs student athletics, that were also found in violation have already refused to sign the agreement.
This development is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to enforce Title IX provisions concerning gender and athletics. Earlier this year, the administration launched investigations in several other states for similar policies allowing trans athletes to compete in alignment with their gender identity.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination, does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
Rachel Perera, a fellow in the governance studies program for the Brown Center on Education Policy at national think tank the Brookings Institution, said the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX leaves room for questioning. If the policy goes to trial, she said federal courts may come up with a clearer interpretation.
“It’s going to be really important to see how Maine proceeds, because they’re sort of setting the tone in terms of these other states and other localities who are going to be trying to navigate these very same dynamics,” she said.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Washington was among 23 states that sued the Trump administration Tuesday over the cancellation of $12 billion in federal funding to address infectious diseases, substance abuse and mental illness, including about $160 million for Washington.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of the abrupt termination last week of grants related to disease tracking, vaccination efforts and other work that officials said could cost thousands of jobs in public health departments nationwide. This pot of money makes up $11 billion of the $12 billion cut. 
The cuts in Washington reportedly include $118 million for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases program, impacting 150 full-time employees. Losing this money will hurt the state’s ability to respond to emerging outbreaks, including measles and bird flu, according to the complaint.
That money also continued to support COVID-related surveillance efforts, the lawsuit says.  
In total, Washington’s Department of Health stands to lose around $130 million, an agency spokesperson said last week, with the termination affecting upward of 200 department employees, and more at local health departments, tribal health clinics and community-based organizations.
One of the specific programs affected is Care Connect, which the department launched early in the pandemic to provide food and other needs to people with COVID so they could isolate. The program later shifted to meet the needs of those suffering from long COVID, among other things.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown also cites the state’s Care-A-Van mobile health clinics that provide vaccinations and other services to underserved communities. Officials have already had to cancel clinics due to the lost funding. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rolled back the grants “for cause” because “the pandemic is over,” so the funding is no longer needed, according to the lawsuit. The states counter that the money was never intended to only be used to respond to the COVID pandemic.
The lawsuit also tackles the separate but simultaneous Trump administration axing of another $1 billion in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration funding, including $34 million for Washington. 
Brown is one of several attorneys general leading Tuesday’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island. The Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are named as defendants. The department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
“We can’t make America healthy by spreading preventable diseases,” Brown said. “Aside from the illegality of these actions, the administration is also choosing to neglect the biggest public health challenges, including substance abuse and mental health crises, facing our communities.”
The states say the cuts violate the Administrative Procedure Act by suddenly terminating the grants without much explanation. The plaintiffs asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to reverse the cuts. 
The state Department of Health’s now-canceled federal grant dollars were expected to expire between June 2025 and July 2026, agency spokesperson Marisol Mata Somarribas said.
Also on Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services began its purge of 10,000 federal workers.
As part of the layoff announcement, Kennedy also said he’d be halving the number of Health and Human Services regional offices from 10 to five. Seattle’s office serves Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. Its fate was unclear Tuesday.
This is at least the 8th lawsuit Brown has led or joined against the Trump administration since January.

Deep cuts to Medicaid are being debated on Capitol Hill right now. Lawmakers could slash federal funding for state programs, force enrollees to work to keep their coverage or kick those who qualified under expansions off the rolls, among the options on the table.
The U.S. House of Representatives, narrowly controlled by Republicans, passed a bill last month requiring the Committee on Energy and Commerce to find $880 billion in spending cuts over a decade — a necessity to extend tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy. The committee oversees Medicaid, which means some aspects of the program will likely be on the chopping block.
What kind of cuts are we most likely to see? And what could they mean for vulnerable — and even well-off — people in the Pittsburgh region?
We asked Marian Jarlenski, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Public Health and associate director of CONVERGE@Pitt, a research center that studies sexual and reproductive health. She’s an expert on Medicaid whose research explores how its policies and programs could improve pregnancy and reproductive health outcomes. Her team built this dashboard that offers a snapshot of Medicaid reliance in congressional districts nationwide. It shows that about 174,000 people in Pennsylvania’s 12th congressional district — which includes the City of Pittsburgh and is represented by Democrat Rep. Summer Lee — are enrolled in Medicaid and the state’s Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP].
Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with each state administering its own program. The generosity of those programs can vary, but Jarlenski said Pennsylvania’s program is fairly robust. It covers kids with disabilities regardless of household income, connects people leaving jails and prisons with care, and integrates parts of Medicare and Medicaid plans for those who qualify for both.
Those “innovative programs” could now be at risk, she said. “It’s hindering our ability in Pennsylvania to move forward … and think of new ways to address public health. Instead, [we’ll be] on the defensive and saying, ‘Where can we cut?’”
The following conversation was edited for length and clarity.
Q: Medicaid cuts can take many forms. Which ones would cause the most damage?
This is a tough question to answer because we don’t know the details of how cuts would be implemented. But the three main cuts that Congress could consider would be:
1) Imposing a work requirement, which makes each person document their work status. The evidence shows it doesn’t increase employment, but instead creates more red tape and causes people to lose their benefits.
2) The block grant option. The federal government gives a lump sum of money to states, and states decide how to allocate the money. Typically, the lump sum would grow more slowly than the cost of medical care would grow. And so over time, states could have to limit who’s on Medicaid. Waiting lists for benefits existed before the Affordable Care Act [ACA]. We had what’s known as ‘state-only programs’ and the funding for them was restricted. This happened in Oregon, which had a waiting list for the Oregon Health Plan because there just wasn’t enough money to cover everyone.
I think the brute force of this cut would cause the most damage. It would make it really infeasible for Pennsylvania and other states to provide the kind of benefits they do now. And that’s why 20% of adults were uninsured in the United States before the ACA allowed Medicaid expansion. Because it’s just so cost-prohibitive for each state to go it alone.
3) And the third potential option is cutting off the federal match for the Medicaid expansion population. (The ACA allows states to expand coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.) In Pennsylvania, the Medicaid expansion population is low-income adults who don’t have dependent children, and many low-income parents who have dependent children. The federal government pays 90% of the cost of this group’s Medicaid insurance, and cutting that off would increase the state’s spending burden. The increased pressure on our state budget could have negative spillover effects in other areas, such as education, transportation, economic development, all those big-ticket items.
Q: A fifth of Allegheny County residents rely on Medicaid. And your lab’s dashboard shows that more than 174,000 people in the congressional district that includes the City of Pittsburgh rely on Medicaid and CHIP. How do those numbers compare to what we’re seeing on a national level?
Our county and congressional district line up pretty closely with the national average. More than 20% of Americans are enrolled in Medicaid. Who are they? Working class and poor people who need health insurance. It also includes pregnant patients, a lot of kids, and importantly, people in long-term care settings who spent all their assets paying for those services. So a lot of middle- and even upper-middle class people will rely on Medicaid for their long-term care needs in old age.
Also, about a third of births in Allegheny County are covered by Medicaid. And we have a new policy in Pennsylvania: Any baby whose birth is covered by Medicaid is now automatically enrolled in the program through age 6, which is really exciting. But these cuts would put the health insurance of pregnant women and kids up to age 6 at risk.
Q: I want to pick up the thread on older adults with different class backgrounds needing Medicaid. We know that Medicare generally won’t pay for nursing home care, but Medicaid will. Our county has a higher concentration of older adults than most other large counties in the country. Could these cuts have a disproportionate impact here because of that?
I think it depends on the type of cuts. Some of the proposals to cut Medicaid would exempt people with disabilities, including long-term care residents. For example, a work requirement would not apply to them. … If we’re going into a block grant or limiting per-person spending, it would absolutely hurt the ability of nursing homes in our area to serve all. It can cost up to $100,000 a year per person for nursing home care, not counting additional health care in the hospital and things that may be paid for by Medicare. So I definitely would be concerned if we’re talking about limiting spending per person, or an overall block grant, for the feasibility of nursing homes to continue to serve the population.
Q: You study Medicaid’s impact on pregnancy and reproductive health outcomes. We know that maternal and infant health outcomes are worse for Black people than their white counterparts in the county. Could these cuts exacerbate the disparities?
That’s an excellent question. Before I answer it, I want to emphasize that Medicaid coverage is the same regardless of your race or ethnicity. But because of social and historical factors, such as redlining, we see in the demographic data that people of color might be more likely to be working class and belong to low-income households in Allegheny County. So we do see a slightly higher rate of Medicaid coverage in populations of color.
Medicaid is the single largest program in pregnancy and reproductive health space, so I feel it could really incentivize health care systems or Medicaid health plans to focus on interventions to reduce health disparities. If it’s a big part of the population you serve, you’re going to notice and document the disparities and try to take action to intervene on those. So in that sense, Medicaid coverage is the floor on which we could build interventions to address health disparities and ensure that everybody has high quality care and good pregnancy outcomes. If that floor goes away, those systems will be scrambling for basic insurance coverage instead of trying to build a better future.
Q: We know that Medicaid can be a lifeline for people with disabilities — especially if their disabilities prevent them from working or if they need assistance with daily living. About 11% of Pittsburghers have disabilities. How could these cuts affect them?

There are people with disabilities who receive Supplemental Security Income, which automatically qualifies them for Medicaid. Typically, a work requirement [for Medicaid enrollees] would exempt those people. Then there are people who have some kind of condition that would be disabling in their daily life, but don’t have an official disability determination. And those folks, of course, would be subject to work requirements.
The other thing I want to say is that people with a disability determination have to stay under a certain income threshold to keep their benefits. So even if people want to work full time or be promoted, they can’t do that because they have to keep their income low enough to qualify. That’s a problem that disability advocates have been talking about for probably 40 years. It has not been fixed yet, and cutting benefits is certainly not going to fix it. Like those in nursing homes, people with disabilities often have complex and expensive health care needs. So any proposal to limit per-person spending or give a block grant is going to hurt the medical system’s ability to serve them.
Q: Health care facilities power a big part of Pittsburgh’s economy. I imagine these cuts would significantly impact medical billing at hospitals and in the broader health systems, which employ so many people here. 
That’s right. It would have spillover effects on the economy and jobs. Health care is a large part of our economy in Pennsylvania. And health care work is the second-most common type of job among people who are enrolled in Medicaid. So people who work as home-care attendants or as medical techs or in long-term care facilities tend to have working-class incomes, and they are actually covered by Medicaid. So it’s all tied together.
Q: The Trump administration vowed not to cut Medicaid and said the budget resolution would only target “waste and fraud in entitlement spending.” Republicans in Congress have echoed that. Experts said this is misleading, and that it’s impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings without slashing Medicaid. How is waste and fraud controlled, and do we need these cuts to do it better?    
What we tend to see is fraudulent billing to Medicare or Medicaid managed care plans. A common type of fraud or abuse involves [a provider] creating a fake patient profile and billing for them. I think we can all agree that fraud is bad — I can say that unequivocally. We would all support more fraud investigation funding, and you would think the federal government would be adding jobs to the Department of Health and Human Services rather than cutting them if it wanted to beef up the workload.
The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] put out a report last week that actually found that Pennsylvania had the highest number of Medicaid fraud and abuse claims. They had investigated around 19,000 claims. (The state also ranked third in convictions of those who abuse its Medicaid program.) So I feel like our program is doing a pretty good job at combating fraud and abuse, and so I’m not really sure what else we can be doing there. We’re No. 1 in the nation.
Q: What can state and local policymakers do to mitigate the damage? 
Well, it’s really hard because you need to fund a Medicaid program at scale. Most of our income taxes go to the federal government. And a lot of it comes back through these state and federal programs.
One option would be for states to band together to get that scale. There is a mechanism called an interstate compact. It’s been done around water rights and things of that nature, but I don’t see why that type of agreement can’t be developed for medical assistance. I think we need to draw on the expertise of people in our region, in health care and education, to think of the most creative ideas. Absent that, I think everybody has a role to play in educating elected officials about the importance of these programs to our economy and, obviously, to people’s health. Because how devastating would it be if you had a health condition and weren’t able to get care for it?

Feb. 25, 2025.( Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine is facing a barrage of healthcare cuts, possibly losing as much as $93 million in federal funding to a wide array of services, from vaccinations and disease tracking to mental and reproductive health.
More than $91 million of these cuts is due to last week’s termination of six federal grants, according to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. Three million is in separate cuts to Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
Attorney General Aaron Frey announced that the state is joining a multi-state lawsuit, along with attorneys general from 23 states and the District of Columbia, against the Trump administration for “abruptly and illegally terminating” funding.
The legal challenge was filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for withholding nearly $11 billion in “critical public health grants” to the states, according to a statement from Frey’s office.
Vaccine distribution, disease monitoring and response and rural health services, among other programs, are at risk if funding is not restored.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, the terminated grants directly impacted work by more than 70 vendors and at least 40 contracted personnel at Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The termination of these grants will compromise Maine’s ability to respond to disease outbreaks, maintain vaccine availability, address health disparities, and support community-based health workforce efforts,” said Maine DHHS Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. “Additionally, these cuts threaten critical planned investments in mental health and substance use disorder services. Maine DHHS is continuing to evaluate the full impact of these cuts to these important public health and behavioral services.”
Most of the funding cuts — about $88 million — affect the Maine CDC and will impact vaccination programs, making it harder to distribute vaccines and educate the public; reduce the state’s ability to monitor outbreaks and run lab tests; cut health equity programs meant to help vulnerable communities and terminate community health services, according to DHHS.
About $3 million will be cut from Maine’s Office of Behavioral Health, impacting substance use prevention programs, and school-based mental health and interventions.
“These actions jeopardize critical public health response capabilities and services, and weaken our state’s public health infrastructure,” said Dr. Puthiery Va, Director of the Maine CDC. 
Congress approved extra funding for health programs during COVID-19, including mental health and addiction services. But on March 24, without legal justification, the federal government suddenly cut off these funds, saying they were no longer needed since the pandemic is over.
Frey and other attorneys general are arguing that these cuts are illegal. They say the funding was never meant to end just because the pandemic officially ended over a year ago, and some of the grants weren’t permitted to be canceled this way.
The lawsuit is asking the court to block the funding cuts and stop the government from enforcing or reinstating them, claiming the decision violates federal law.

DCF operates a 24-hour abuse hotline, but refers calls to law enforcement outside weekday business hours and on weekends. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas child advocate urged the Kansas Legislature to narrow the front door to state custody of children by striking a better balance between harm individuals could face by remaining in a home versus trauma resulting from removal from that residence.
Kansas child advocate Kerrie Lonard said lack of clarity in definitions of neglect and harm led to inconsistent removal decisions by the Kansas Department for Children and Families and the state courts. On Monday, she told the Joint Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight the challenge extended to law enforcement officers making protective custody decisions about children potentially in harm’s way.
Lonard said reports suggested Kansas relied too heavily on police officers and sheriff deputies to make time-critical determinations about the welfare of children. They were drawn into this role with limited information about families and, in some areas of the state, lack of access to alternative services.
“Kansas is relying on law enforcement to not only act as public safety officer, but also that of a social worker,” Lonard said.
Lonard said questions had been raised in Kansas about the percentage of children being removed from homes by law enforcement. Questions also have been posed about whether child trauma could be reduced if DCF personnel were more readily available to be involved in removal decisions, she said.
Lonard said DCF’s protection center hotline operated 24 hours a day, but after-hour calls regarding the possibility of a child in imminent danger were referred to law enforcement. DCF staff was available 40 hours per week to make decisions on child safety and removal,  which left 128 hours per week to be managed primarily by law enforcement officers.
“Law enforcement does not have in-real-time access to DCF resources or historical information to enable consideration of safely vetted alternative options that would prevent children from being placed into police protective custody,” she said.
 
Wichita region dominates
DCF deputy secretary Tanya Keys said the 10-county region of the state that included Wichita had 47.1% of the state’s police protective custody placements in fiscal year 2024. In terms of the other five regions of the state, the proportion of protective custody cases ranged from 7.3% in the northwest to 12.7% in the southwest.
In other words, 1,182 of the 2,509 Kansas children placed in protective custody by law enforcement in the last fiscal year were in the Wichita region.
In addition, Keys said, the Kansas Department of Corrections reported 39% of children dropped off at juvenile facilities last fiscal year by law enforcement officers across the state were subsequently released to a family member.
“Forty percent of those children are returned to a parent or relative. That’s their placement outcome after a juvenile intake an assessment worker is alongside that family,” Keys said.
The Legislature unanimously voted last week to send Gov. Laura Kelly a bill amending state law concerning when officers could take a child under 18 into custody for suspected abuse or neglect. Under House Bill 2075, Kansas law enforcement officers would be required to explore other options for shielding a child from harm before turning to protective police custody.
The bill also would add a more direct procedure for law enforcement to report suspected neglect or abuse of a child to DCF for purposes of investigation.
 
Real-time decisions
Ron Paschal, the deputy district attorney in Sedgwick County responsible for the Child In Need of Care division, said the state should be wary of latching onto a set of statistics and deciding too many children were being taken into protective custody by law enforcement agencies.
He said a significant portion of children in protective custody were later returned home, but that didn’t mean initial decisions of law enforcement officers were flawed.
“We can all agree in a perfect world no child should experience removal from home. We all agree that is a traumatic experience,” Paschal said. “But, I think, if we look at the reality, sadly, many children’s lives and safety are at risk at home.”
Former Topeka police chief Ed Klumpp, who lobbies on behalf of three law enforcement associations in Kansas, said the power to place a child in protective custody wasn’t used by officers without exploration of other solutions.
“Taking a child into police protective custody can be traumatic not only for the child and family, but also to the officer,” Klumpp said.
Klumpp said the issue came before the Legislature due to assertions Kansas’ use of police protective custody might be high compared to other states. He said he wasn’t aware of data supporting the conclusion protective custody was used in Kansas when it was “not justified based on information available to the officer at the time of the decision.”
He agreed DCF’s limited availability from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday required law enforcement officers to grapple with a heavy load in terms of child protection. DCF should be more engaged in the custody process outside normal business hours especially when there was no criminal element to a case, he said.
He also recommended Kansas develop a risk assessment tool for use by law enforcement when determining whether a child could safely be left in the home.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P1240879-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.

“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

As a result, Michigan’s Department of Education is reporting schools around the state will lose nearly $42 million of funding.
Pre-approved projects in 27 Michigan school districts for federal reimbursement were intended to improve air quality and safety in schools following the COVID-19 pandemic, State Superintendent Dr. Michael F. Rice said in a statement Monday. 
“Walking back a federal commitment to pandemic relief funds to improve the air quality, healthfulness, and safety of schools coming out of the pandemic is unacceptable,” Rice said.

The Department of Education under former President Joe Biden had approved extensions to the project reimbursement deadline to March 28, 2026, but with the sudden revocation, Rice said schools locked into contracts will have to cut other facets of education to foot the bill.
“A change in administrations should not void previous commitments,” Rice said. “Without the promised March 2026 date for federal reimbursement requests, districts may be forced to reduce instructional expenditures for students, diminish savings, or both to honor these contracts.”
Rice requested that Secretary McMahon reconsider her decision to cut off funding and implored Michigan’s congressional delegation, including U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee, to act.
The previous administration’s extension “was not justified”, McMahon’s letter on Friday said, adding that state education leaders had “ample” time to receive reimbursement. 
McMahon added that it was an act of “grace” that the department had granted extensions for federal reimbursement and prior approval for projects does not override an agency’s autonomy to reconsider decisions. However, states can request extensions on individual projects, McMahon wrote, which would leave it at the department’s discretion to determine necessity.
“By failing to meet the clear deadline in the regulation, you ran the risk that the Department would deny your extension request. Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
Some of the communities hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic and health care infrastructure will lose the most funding, the Michigan Department of Education reports.
Flint Community Schools will lose out on about $15.6 million in funding, the most in the state, while the city was one of the hardest hit in Michigan by the COVID-19 pandemic. Flint, where the residents were effectively poisoned by lead contamination in 2014 when the city switched its water supply source, creating years of health issues for the community, had the compounded strain during the COVID-19 pandemic as the city was a hotspot for the spread of the virus and residents were slow to receiving the vaccine. 
Other school districts slated to lose funding are Benton Harbor Area Schools, which still had about $4.5 million slotted for them, Hamtramck Public Schools at about $7.2 million and Pontiac School District at about $3.3 million.

The U.S. Department of Education walking back its commitment to health and safety projects is an affront, State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh said in a statement. Pugh, who served as the Chief Public Health Advisor for the City of Flint during the Flint Water Crisis, says she sees communities who are losing funding and recognizes that they are some of the communities who are in the most need of projects that help keep kids healthy. 
“These federally funded projects are important to students and staff in our districts in Michigan and across the country,” Pugh said. “To cancel funding approval on no notice and to tell districts that they may apply for a second approval from the U.S. Department of Education to access these funds, with different criteria, has nothing to do with service to schoolchildren.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado health officials announced late Monday that they had confirmed a case of measles in a Pueblo resident.
It’s Colorado’s first confirmed measles case since 2023 and just its third case in the last nine years. It comes amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas that have caused at least one death of an unvaccinated child. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Utah sees measles vaccination bump as outbreak spreads in nearby states

In a press release, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the Pueblo case was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult who had “recently traveled to an area of Mexico experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak.”
Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and two doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provides about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. State law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, but allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
​​“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we know, but it is also highly preventable,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally. We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Based on initial information, CDPHE officials say that Pueblo residents who visited the Southwest Deli and Cafe at 1873 S. Pueblo Blvd. between March 17 and March 21, or the Southern Colorado Clinic at 109 South Burlington Drive on the afternoon of March 22, may have been exposed to measles. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

The proposal, HB 955, from Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, would expand the use of E-Verify, the system that public agencies, their contractors, and companies with more than 25 employees must use to confirm their new hires are authorized to work.
Unlike the other two bills expanding E-Verify requirements, Jacques’ proposal doesn’t bring additional fines and penalties against employers hiring immigrants without work permits. However, HB 955 is the only E-Verify bill that has moved in the Florida Legislature this year.
“It’s not a gotcha mission. It’s to make sure we’re compliant, and we wanna make sure that those who are in this country working are authorized to do so,” Jacques said during the House Industries and Professional Activities Subcommittee meeting.
The sponsor, a Haitian immigrant, insisted his bill is not about immigrant workers.
“One of the things I want to highlight before I end my close is to not conflate immigrant workers with what we’re talking about here,” Jacques said. “Just because you’re an immigrant doesn’t mean you’re not authorized to work.”
Some Democrats warn stricter E-Verify requirements could drive workforce away

Gov. Ron DeSantis gave an early nod of approval to HB 955 before the legislative session started. Still, the proposal drew criticism over its lack of additional penalties from Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo, who is sponsoring a dueling bill imposing tens of thousands of dollars in fines and loss of business licenses for companies hiring immigrants unauthorized to work in the country.
Spring Hill Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia also proposed a bill, SB 1498, that would add penalties for those employers and require all companies to use E-Verify.
More than 441,000 Florida companies have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2023 report from the Office of Advocacy at the U.S. Small Business Administration, meaning that they don’t have to use E-Verify.
The Florida Department of Commerce can already fine employers $1,000 per day if they get caught not using E-Verify three times within two years. Companies hiring people unauthorized to work get placed on probation for a year.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said she was concerned about the national trend of branding immigrants without legal status as dangerous and criminals.
“Of course, we want every business to go through these proceedings and to ensure these are workers with visas and so forth, but we also know that the immigration system is dramatically broken,” Eskamani said.
“There are folks who have a visa, and then it expires, and the process to renew is very limited. And these are folks who are also paying taxes, they’re contributing to our economy and, beyond an unregulated status, they’re not dangerous.”
The bill has one more committee stop before reaching the House floor.
“We’re going to fight and see it through to the very end, and the ball will be in the Senate’s court as to what they want to do,” Jacques told Florida Phoenix.

Trump believes the reciprocal tariffs will level the playing field with other nations. But investors have shown they are nervous that Trump’s plan could result in a protracted trade war that ultimately will cost American consumers more.
  Economist Mike Walden (Photo: NC State University)
To get a better understanding of the Trump tariffs and their impact, NC Newsline recently sat down with Mike Walden, the William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor and Extension Economist at North Carolina State University.
Some answers have been edited for brevity and clarity. Click here to listen to our full radio interview with Prof. Mike Walden. 
NC Newsline: It certainly appears the mood of the American consumer is, if not, souring a little jittery. Before we get into talking about tariffs, do you have any sort of overarching observations?
Walden: Yes. In terms of mood, that is backed up by surveys of consumer sentiment, small business sentiment. They have gone down. I think that’s part of the reason is because of tariffs, which we’ll talk about. Also, I think that people had an expectation that when President Trump was elected we will automatically see prices go down. In fact, he promised that. That’s not what’s going to happen, unfortunately.
I get this question all the time when I give talks. But what’s going to happen is that the rate of increase of prices is going to slow. And we’ve seen that over the last couple of years. But people should not expect prices to go back to 2019 levels. And it has nothing to do with politics. It just is not the way the system works.
Then we have some other flashing points. Obviously, the stock market’s been down. That’s a reflection, I think, of all these other factors. Job growth seems to have slowed. Retail spending, which really drives the economy, that has slowed.
So yeah, there are a host of things here that’s causing some, I wouldn’t say fear, but certainly some anxiety about where the economy is going.
NC Newsline: I do want to ask about tariffs. Who’s for these tariffs other than the president? Is he addressing a constituency that actually wants this at this point?
Walden: Well, of course, I’m not a political scientist, but the way I view Donald Trump is he is a person, has his own views.
I think one of his impetuses is that he remembers the America of old, when we manufactured pretty much everything that we used in the country. That’s changed dramatically. Economists would argue, hey, if we can get something cheaper in another country, then why not?
But I think the president has some views that are anchored in the past.
I think he has a stronger case when you look at, most countries impose tariffs of some kind and some level. But if you look at the level of tariffs in other countries versus the U.S., we’re pretty much at the bottom in terms of the rate of tariffs that we’ve imposed. And this is all pre-Trump.
I think he views that as unfair. He has this notion of having reciprocal tariffs. If Europe has 3%, we’ll have 3%, not have Europe have 15% and we have 3%.
So, I think that’s another motivation. He has embarked on a strategy that he thinks is a good one to either threaten higher tariffs or actually impose higher tariffs and get the reaction of other countries.
Now, I will say in terms of his goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., you don’t have to look any further than North Carolina. You’re old enough to remember when North Carolina had tobacco and cigarette manufacturing. We had a large textile and apparel and furniture industries. Those have been pretty much decimated because of cheaper costs in other countries.
  North Carolina was once prized for its ability to craft furniture. But Dr. Walden says cheaper prices in other countries decimated the industry. Rebuilding that manufacturing sector will not happen overnight, according to Walden. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)
So even if the president wants to bring those back, they’re not gonna come back overnight.
There is a concern that the higher levels of tariffs will impose actually, ironically, higher cost on U.S. consumers because, the entity that pays the tariff is not the exporting company from a foreign country. It’s the importing company.
So, for example, if I sell toys and buy my toys from China and the president slaps a 25% tariff on what I buy from China. China does not pay those or the company in China does not pay them, I pay them. And usually what happens in that case, as you might expect, if my costs go up, if a business’s cost go up, they’re gonna’ try to pass those higher costs on to their buyers. So that’s where the rub comes here.
Even though we may get to the point where manufacturing comes back and other countries maybe eased their tariffs, there’s going to be this transition period that can be bumpy and it’s interesting that Trump administration has already sort of recognized that and some of the leverage they’ve used.
NC Newsline: What about just the ever-changing nature of it? It seems like one day there’s a tariff, the next day we’re pulling it back. This is inspiring counteractions by other nations. This is going to have an effect on these outcomes as well, I would assume.
Walden: Well, I guess the way I would interpret that is [that it’s] just the way Donald Trump operates — probably the way he operated when he was in the private sector, running the real estate companies. I think he wants to be unpredictable. He doesn’t want whatever group he’s dealing with — he doesn’t want them to be to anticipate what he’s going to do. And maybe that worked for him in the private sector. We’ll see if it works for him in the public sector.
NC Newsline: Speaking of agriculture, what about the price of eggs? And what about China – they’re a big soybean importer. Won’t that have an impact on North Carolina and U.S. farmers?
Walden: We are a big agricultural state. A lot of states in the country are big agricultural states. We are very good at producing a variety of agricultural products, as well as the country.
  Agriculture could also take a hit if other countries respond to Trump’s new tariffs. The move comes as most consumers would just like to see the price of eggs decline. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)
A lot of that is consumed domestically, but a lot of it is sold to foreign countries because of our great ability to raise food. And I think China has already said, if we impose higher tariffs on China, China has been, for example, a big buyer of a lot of U.S. and North Carolina ag products. If we impose a higher tariff on China, like the toy example I was giving, they’re going to come back, and I think they already have come back and impose a higher tariff on our ag sellers.
So that’s another element in this whole combination here, what’s going on regarding the economy and tariffs.
It’s not just the foreign producers that are affected by that tariff, and it’s not just the importers in our countries that are affected by the tariff. It’s our producers also, because usually when you impose tariffs, if you go to a tariff war, if I can use that term, the other country is going to say, “okay, you’re raising your tariffs, we’re going to up the tariffs that we have on your products, and that’s where it hits our domestic industries.”
And here in North Carolina, it’s not just ag, it’s pharmaceuticals, it’s auto parts, there’s a whole variety of things that we export. I don’t have the exact number, but we’re in the multi billions of dollars in terms of exports going out of North Carolina.
NC Newsline: You wrote a piece for WRAL’s TechWire that used the ‘R word’ – recession. Is that something that’s seriously in play at this point?
Walden: If you take a poll of economists, it looks like about one in three economists right now are saying, it’s a very good chance we have a recession this year.
Let me back up and say, there’s a difference between the economy slowing down and there is a recession.
I do think we’re definitely in a slowdown phase of the economy. What that simply means, we’re still growing, but not growing as fast. You see that in the job numbers. We’re adding jobs, but not nearly as fast. We’ve actually seen a little bit of uptick in the unemployment rate. The recession means that you’re actually shrinking. We’re actually producing less. Not only do jobs not go up as fast, but they actually go down. The unemployment rate jumps. Most economists are not there yet, but I think the big worry, quite frankly, is why this talk has really jumped off the page is tariffs.
And what you’ve said earlier, the Trump administration seems to be very, very unpredictable in terms of we just don’t know where they’re going. I think that’s been the main reason why there have been some slumps in recent days on Wall Street.
The biggest thing investors don’t like is unpredictability. They don’t like that. They hate that.
That’s the word they hate most. President Trump likes tariffs the most. Unpredictability is word investors don’t like.
NC Newsline: What about the Department of Government Efficiency, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that Elon Musk is apparently running in Washington. We’re having these massive cuts to — at least it looks like it — to federal employment, to grants and funding for universities and research. Is that going to have an impact on the economy?
Walden:  It’s going to have an impact. I don’t think it’s going to be big enough to cause a recession, but it’s clearly going to have an impact. And if you live in the DC area, you’re having a big impact. That could send the DC economy into recession, but outside the DC still impacts, but it’s going to be localized.
But we’ve already seen them here in North Carolina, particularly in the region where we lived, the Research Triangle part, because we a lot have a lot of private institutions.
We have public institutions that depend on federal grants, and many of those are being cut back, if not eliminated. Employment’s going down.
So that, again, I don’t think is enough to send our region into a recession, but it is a bump in the road.
It is going to mean that more people, perhaps, won’t have a job at least temporarily. That affects not just those families, but there’s a downstream effect.
If your family budget is cut because your job is one of the jobs cut, that means you have less to spend. So the grocery doesn’t get as much money. The people in retail stores don’t get as much money. So, you can have a slowdown in growth.
Clearly, this area is growing and will continue to grow, but the growth rate might be somewhat more modest because of what the DOGE plan is doing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tequila.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)The Washington state House passed its budget just after midnight on Tuesday, setting the stage for negotiations with the Senate and the governor on a spending blueprint to address a looming multi-billion dollar shortfall.
The House approved the two-year $77.8 billion operating budget on a 54-44 vote in which five Democrats joined all Republicans in opposition. 
The decision followed a roughly six-hour debate in which majority Democrats rejected more than two dozen Republican amendments to curb taxes and fees, boost special education funding, improve health care services and halt the proposed closure of a women’s prison.
The plan spends roughly $5.3 billion more than the current budget. Of that, $920 million is for new policies on top of the sum needed to pay for rising costs of current programs and uphold statutory obligations. The spending plan leaves $1.7 billion in reserves at the end of the first fiscal year and $3.2 billion by the end of the biennium.
Washington’s next budget cycle begins July 1 and runs through June 30, 2027.
To balance their proposal, House Democrats pencil in $5.2 billion from a revenue package that includes removing the 1% cap on annual growth in property tax collections, adding a surcharge on large corporations and financial institutions, and levying a new and untested tax on wealth that is similar, but not identical, to one proposed in the Senate.
Those new dollars will prevent deeper reductions to critical state programs and services, Democrats said.
“An all-cuts budget would be catastrophic. People will die,” said Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, who was part of the Democrat budget writing team.
Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the budget  “is what we were able to do with the resources we have. This is a budget that puts people first.”
Republicans said the new taxes and higher fees will hit working families hardest. Several cited the proposal to lift the 1% cap on annual property tax collections as maybe the most harmful.
“This budget doesn’t just tax the wealthy. It taxes every day working residents,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “Enough is enough. My constituents need real tax relief. We should stop using them as a bottomless ATM.”
House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, said the budget spends more than it brings in. And the tax package, he said, is too large and will drive jobs out of state.
“This budget is the wrong direction for Washington state,” he said.
On Saturday, the Senate passed its $78.5 billion operating budget. It relies on nearly $6.2 billion from a four-year, $17 billion package of tax changes drawn up by Democrats that has yet to be voted on.
It contains measures similar to those in the House to increase the cap on annual growth in property tax collections and to tax wealthy individuals. The Senate also wants to impose a new tax on the payrolls of large companies, axe several tax breaks and reduce the sales tax rate. 
With the passage of budgets in each chamber, negotiations can begin in earnest to reconcile differences in the spending approaches.
House and Senate budget writers will also need to work with Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, who has pressed lawmakers to reduce spending before considering new taxes to deal with the shortfall.
Ferguson is expected to share his thoughts on each budget at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
The governor and Democratic lawmakers estimate the shortfall to be in the $12 billion to $16 billion range over four years. The sum represents the amount needed to maintain current levels of service, pay for new and expanded programs authorized in previous budgets and cover the cost of new collective bargaining agreements with employee unions.
One of the largest cost-cutting moves in the House budget is a delay in the expansion of popular early learning and child care programs. The Senate takes a similar step.
But the House does not look to save money by furloughing state workers for up to 13 days or to balance by draining the state’s emergency savings, referred to as the rainy day fund. The Senate seeks to do both.
On the spending side, the House pledges about $1 billion less in new funding for special education and public school operating costs.
The House budget has $25 million — $12.5 million in each fiscal year — for grants to help local governments hire more law enforcement officers. They promise to make another $25 million available in the 2027-29 budget for a four-year total of $50 million. There’s nothing like this in the Senate plan. 
This will be an area to work out with Ferguson. In his inaugural address, the governor said he wanted $100 million for this purpose in the next two-year budget. “That idea was a cornerstone of my campaign for governor. Any budget I sign must include this funding,” he said.
Republican lawmakers in the House proposed an amendment to boost the amount for grants as the governor sought, but it was defeated.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

The conflict between the state of Maine and the Trump administration over transgender student athletes reached a new pivot point on Monday. As the first of several deadlines set by the federal government has now expired, whether Maine can continue to allow trans athletes to participate in sports appears likely to be decided by the courts.
Two separate federal agencies determined that Maine is in violation of Title IX based on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the anti-sex discrimination protection. 
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency. 
In a letter dated March 17, HHS had given Maine a deadline of 10 days to comply with federal guidance. Monday marked ten business days from that warning. 
Both agencies determined that Maine had violated federal law after dayslong investigations that included no interviews, while typical investigations take months and are eventually settled with resolution agreements. The probes were launched after Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump had a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy. Millions of dollars in federal funding might be at risk, depending on how the cases proceed. 
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the Education Department who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases.
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
On March 19, the Department of Education’s civil rights office notified Maine of its noncompliance and proposed a resolution agreement that would require the state to rescind its support of trans athletes, which is currently required by the Maine Human Rights Act. A Cumberland-area school district and the Maine Principals Association, which runs student athletics, that were also found in violation have already refused to sign the agreement. 
This development is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to enforce Title IX provisions concerning gender and athletics. Earlier this year, the administration launched investigations in several other states for similar policies allowing trans athletes to compete in alignment with their gender identity. 
Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination, does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
Rachel Perera, a fellow in the governance studies program for the Brown Center on Education Policy at national think tank The Brookings Institution, said the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX leaves room for questioning. If the policy goes to trial, she said federal courts may come up with a clearer interpretation.
“It’s going to be really important to see how Maine proceeds, because they’re sort of setting the tone in terms of these other states and other localities who are going to be trying to navigate these very same dynamics,” she said.

No answers yet.,Julie O'Donoghue,,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/04/01/will-louisiana-teachers-face-a-pay-cut-no-answers-yet/,Are the governor and legislators willing to cut teachers compensation?,"Louisiana legislative leaders have said yet whether they will look at prevent public school teacher pay from being cut. (Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry tied public school teacher pay to a constitutional amendment on budget and tax policies that failed spectacularly at the polls Saturday. 

Now the question is: Are the governor and legislators willing to cut teachers compensation? 
Landry’s budget proposal does not contain money for stipends of $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received, respectively, over the past two years. They were relying on financial benefits reaped from Amendment 2 passing to help cover the cost of that compensation. 
With the amendment now scuttled, the governor and lawmakers would have to take money from other items in Landry’s budget to cover the expense. But it’s not clear what type of appetite they have to do so. 
Legislators in leadership declined to say Monday whether the state’s 59,000 public school teachers should expect a pay cut as a result of Amendment 2 not passing. 
“That is probably going to end up being the lynchpin of the session,” said Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, author of the failed Amendment 2. “I really don’t know how that is going to go.”
Keeping teacher pay level with the current year would be expensive. Lawmakers would have to find $200 million in Landry’s proposed budget to cover the expense of another temporary, yearly stipend or to make a similar permanent salary increase on July 1. 

Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, is asking legislators to let him know if funding the additional teacher pay is their primary concern. He is one of the state budget architects as the House Appropriations Committee chairman. 

“If [the lawmakers] priorities are the teachers’ stipends, then I’m going to have to know it,” McFarland said. “To do the stipend, I would have to look at everything in the budget.”
Even though teachers are facing potential pay cuts, Landry has included funding increases for other education initiatives in his budget. 
For example, he’s set aside an additional $50 million for a new private school voucher program called LA GATOR for the next academic year. The initiative will allow more than 5,000 students to use public money to attend private schools or to pay for other private school education expenses such as uniforms and tutoring. 
The average salary of a Louisiana teacher is already below that of other southern states. It was $54,248 for the 2022-23 school year, when the regional average was $59,145, according to the latest numbers from the Southern Regional Education Board. The additional $2,000, first awarded in the 2023-24 school year, was meant to bring teachers closer to that pay range. 
The decision to cut teacher pay would be especially unfortunate this year, said Ronnie Morris, president of the Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. 

Louisiana made major gains in reading comprehension on national tests – larger than those seen in any other state this year. Morris said the state’s public school teachers are responsible for that success, which legislators and Landry have already celebrated, and they shouldn’t have their pay cut after reaching such a milestone, he said. 

“It would be a shame not to recognize our teachers for the work they’ve done to better position our state,” Morris said. “I think that’s the wrong message.”

Louisiana’s biggest teachers unions also endorsed the failed constitutional amendment that Landry and lawmakers were backing because of its ties to teacher pay. 

Louisiana legislators will begin to debate state budget priorities in their legislative session that starts April 14.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/KidsinSchool-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 12:15:41.852145

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The North Carolina House Rules Committee advanced a bill Tuesday that would permit the expedited removal of unauthorized persons from residences, though some lawmakers voiced concerns over issues of due process.
Under House Bill 96, which was approved by the Judiciary 1 Committee last week, property owners and their representatives would be allowed to request law enforcement officers to remove individuals who are unlawfully inhabiting a residence they own and refuse to leave. A tenant who is holding over after a lease term has expired would not be subject to the bill as it does not apply to properties that were offered “as an accommodation for the general public,” nor to circumstances in which payment for continued residence was demanded or paid or a contract permitting residence was agreed upon.
Upon the property owner’s request, a county magistrate would be empowered to authorize the expedited removal of the occupant and require law enforcement to evict them from the property within 24 hours as well as potentially arrest them if they have violated trespassing or other laws. The bill also provides for law enforcement to “stand by to keep the peace” while the property owner changes locks and removes the occupant’s personal belongings, shielding officers from liability for complying with the law in good faith.
The bill would also protect property owners and their representatives from liability if the occupant’s personal belongings are destroyed or damaged during the removal process unless the removal is found to be wrongful. In cases of wrongful removal, occupants can bring civil action to recover the property, costs and damages incurred, and a civil fine and attorneys’ fees. And if the occupant and the owner are engaged in litigation prior to removal, expedited removal is prohibited.
  Rep. Steve Tyson (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Steve Tyson (R-Craven), who is a realtor and general contractor, said the bill is designed to target people who unlawfully inhabit homes and apartments where there was never a valid lease. Tyson said the bill was motivated by concern that such removals can be held up in court and appeals “practically forever,” and he felt it necessary to make the process “fair for the property owner.”
“Anybody can get a lease online now and print it out,” Tyson said. “You can go somewhere online, find a copy of the deed to the property if you’re savvy and see how the owner of the property signs their name. And so, it puts law enforcement in a very precarious position.”
But Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry), who is an attorney, said she has “genuine concerns” over the lack of due process for occupants under the expedited removal bill, adding that she plans to vote against the bill on the floor.
  Rep. Sarah Stevens (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“There’s a tremendous amount of violation of due process in this procedure,” Stevens said. “A magistrate has no authority to take evidence to determine if there’s any fairness or hear from the other side at all.”
She said even with the liability waiver at the state level, the bill puts law enforcement at risk for litigation over potential due process violations at the federal level.
Tyson said the penalties for filing for expedited removal under false premises act as a sufficient deterrent to property owners, even without an initial opportunity for the occupant to present their case.
“If an unscrupulous landlord — and there are a few of those out there as we know — goes in and swears this affidavit on this expedited removal and he perjures himself, it’s punishable as a class F felony,” Tyson said. “That’s up to five years in prison.”
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), who put forth a similar proposal in the previous session, said “we need to do something” because property owners are losing out on tens of thousands of dollars because they are unable to remove people unlawfully living in residences they own.
“You get nothing and you are the one responsible for the property taxes on the property,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if this is the right way to do it, Representative Stevens, but we’ve got to do something because people are losing money.”
While in favor of the bill creating an “express lane” for removal, Rep. Reece Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), a former police chief, raised concerns over the onus placed on law enforcement to supervise the removal of occupants’ personal belongings. He advised turning to a separate civil process for that aspect of the law. “Being a law enforcement officer, being on the scene, I don’t want to get into a he said-she said over a piece of property.”
The bill was one of 20 that received the Rules Committee’s approval Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)President Donald Trump is “not joking” about a third term.  
Since this shocking and constitutionally tenuous admission, pundits and journalists from both sides of the political aisle have been abuzz with commentary.  
The short answer as to whether Trump can be elected for a third term is no. The 22nd Amendment expressly forbids a two-term president from being elected to a third term. So there. Discussion over. Challenge to long-held constitutional beliefs averted. No need to discuss this issue further. 
However, this issue is not that simple. In fact, it is rather complex.
Language matters when it comes to the Constitution. The 22nd Amendment’s use of the term “elected” precludes Trump from being elected for a third term, but it does not create ineligibility for unelected paths to the presidency. Looking at you Gerald Ford. As Trump provocatively stated “there are methods” to achieve such an outcome. 
In the classroom, New Hampshire civics teachers should take this opportunity to discuss the interactions and limitations of the 12th, 22nd, and 25th amendments. While currently untested, these constitutional ramifications should be explored by the young minds about to take hold of the reins of America’s republic. 
The 22nd Amendment
Constitutional theories about how a two-term president could return for a third term have been postulated before. This was evident in 2008 when Bill Clinton was a potential addition to a Clinton-Clinton Democratic Party ticket. Such a return to the Oval Office for any two-term president is predicated on an issue found within the interplay of the 12th and 22nd amendments.
Following the four elected terms of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Congress moved to ratify the 22nd Amendment, setting the current constitutional limit at two presidential terms. The amendment states “[n]o person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice…”
This language clearly forbids a president being elected to a third term via the Electoral College system. What is not clear in this language is any limit placed on the election of a vice president. The omission of election-based language for the vice president creates a constitutional scenario where a twice-elected president is eligible to seek out a term as vice president. Once in office, all that would need to happen is a presidential resignation and the vice president would assume the higher office, unelected for a third term. All along not running afoul of the 22nd Amendment. 
If Trump pursues this theory and it prevails in the federal court system, it could set a precedent allowing Democrats to do the same in the future with their preferred candidate or potentially enable Barack Obama, George Bush, or Bill Clinton to seek a third term.
The 12th Amendment
After Congress tied 35 times while trying to elect the winner of the election of 1800, it surmised a solution to avoid confusion surrounding separate electoral ballots for president and vice president. The result of which was the 12th Amendment.  
Putting aside a nuanced discussion about the changes made to the presidential ballot system, the most germane part of the 12th Amendment is its last sentence, “… no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.”
Clear as day, if an individual is ineligible for the presidency, he or she cannot become the vice president. However, it is not that clear for a few reasons. The first reason being that the 12th Amendment was written 150 years prior to the 22nd Amendment and term limits did not exist for the president. Although they were discussed at the Constitutional Convention and within Federalist 72 by none other than Alexander Hamilton, a man who was chastised as a monarchist in his day. The ineligibilities mentioned in the 12th Amendment pertain to the original qualifications of the presidency; age, citizenship, and residency. 
The original intent and text of the 12th Amendment does not include any prohibition against a president seeking a third term. Even if the word election appeared in this amendment, the omission of election-specific language in the 22nd Amendment for the vice president would create substantial vagueness and constitutional uncertainty.
Other paths to the Oval Office
There are other theorized paths and constitutional loopholes Trump could exploit to sit behind the Resolute desk for a third term. Using the language of the 25th Amendment, The Presidential Succession Act, and a few strategically placed political allies, a member of the executive Cabinet could ascend to the presidency. A feat of adept and complex political maneuvering, but given the way Trump has D.C. on its heels, not an impossible outcome.
Trump could also strong-arm a partisan Congress and state governments into passing a 28th Amendment to overturn the 22nd, allowing him to be elected to a third term. This process is highly unlikely to yield beneficial results, as it requires significant supermajorities from Congress and state governments. Trump could also just run again, without any changes to the Constitution and make the claim that he is running to represent the mandate of the people. A term he and his allies have grown fond of using during his second term.
In the New Hampshire civics classroom
Understanding the nuances of the Constitution’s amendments is vital for an informed electorate. The potential loopholes in the 12th, 22nd, and 25th amendments highlight the complexities that challenge long-held political and democratic beliefs.
By discussing these issues in New Hampshire civics classes, students will gain the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate, amend, and safeguard America’s constitutional republic. Educating young minds about these intricacies ensures they are prepared to engage in meaningful civic discourse and approach constitutional issues head on.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpthirdterm-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-04-01 12:15:41.852145

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images).Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Monday ruled that Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall cannot prosecute people who assist individuals seeking to leave the state to obtain abortion care.
U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson Monday ruled in a 131-page opinion that the AG’s threatened enforcement of the state’s criminal laws to prosecute those who assist individuals seeking to leave the state for abortion care violates both the First Amendment and the right to travel.  
“At its core, this case is simply about whether a state may prevent people within its borders from going to another state, and from assisting others in going to another state, to engage in lawful conduct there,” Thompson repeated from his ruling in May denying the AG’s motion to dismiss and added, “The court now answers no, a state cannot.”

The lawsuit was filed by Yellowhammer Fund; WAWC, formerly the West Alabama Women’s Center; Alabama Women’s Center (AWC) in Huntsville and Dr. Yashica Robinson, after Marshall in 2022 publicly threatened to criminally prosecute those who assist women seeking to travel out-of-state to get an abortion under Alabama’s near-total abortion ban. Marshall’s office later defended his power to do so in a court filing in August 2023.
“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the filing stated.
Amanda Priest, a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, wrote in an email that “the office is reviewing the decision to determine the state’s options.”
Alabama has had an effective ban on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion rights protections in 2022. 
Thompson ruled that the attorney general’s threats violated the plaintiffs’ clients’ right to travel. He said in the ruling that the right to travel includes the right both to move physically between states and to do what is lawful in those states, and prosecuting those who facilitate lawful out-of-state abortions would violate that right.
The court also found that the attorney general’s threatened enforcement of Alabama’s criminal laws imposes a content- and viewpoint-based restriction on speech, which violates the First Amendment.
“The attorney general has presented no other reason to deny the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim besides his attempt to invoke the Giboney exception, which, as stated, does not extend to speech in furtherance of lawful out-of-state conduct,” Thompson wrote.
The Giboney exception would restrict speech that is directly part of or essential to committing a crime.
“Since the attorney general’s threatened enforcement cannot meet strict scrutiny, the court will enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for this freedom-of-speech claim,” Thompson concluded.
Thompson, in his conclusion, cautioned against the implications of the attorney general’s threats, writing that it is “one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard.  It is another thing for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help.”
“If Alabama held the power its Attorney General asserts here, it is hard to envision a limiting principle besides what the Attorney General personally sees as permissible and impermissible,” he wrote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)COLFAX, Iowa – As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.
Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Iowa, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
 Farmers received $23 billion in federal assistance during Trump’s first term

The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee, Iowa, that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

There’s plenty to leave behind, they acknowledge. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden wanted lawmakers to greenlight a 1,500-bed, $825 million men’s prison in Lincoln County during this year’s legislative session. He needed support from two-thirds of them. He didn’t get it.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

That proposal’s critics — some of whom now serve on the work group — complained about a lack of transparency, as well as the price tag, facility size and the plan’s focus on a single site. 
Backers, meanwhile, argued that waiting will only cost taxpayers money. The $825 million price tag was guaranteed through Monday. 
Money questions will loom large. Lawmakers have set aside nearly $600 million for prison construction since 2023, and the state’s already spent $55 million on the Lincoln County prison plan. 
The work group has four planned meetings between now and July. The first, a two-day affair in Sioux Falls, begins Wednesday morning.
State Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, a work group member, backed the Lincoln County site during the legislative session. He said it’ll be hard to “unlearn things,” start fresh, and accept that the road may — or may not — lead back to Lincoln County.
The conversation might end, he said, with “boy, we really screwed up when we wasted all that money on that Lincoln County site.”
“If everybody’s going in there with the preconceived notion of where we’re going to wind up, it’s going to be pretty difficult to reach consensus,” Mehlhaff said. 
Three goals for work group
The Rhoden executive order that created the “Project Prison Reset” work group lists three goals: decide if the state needs a new facility, work with a consultant to figure out its size and location, and report findings to a special legislative session on July 22. 
Wednesday’s meeting starts with a morning tour of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls, the 1881 structure the proposed Lincoln County prison was meant to largely replace. A tour of the Lincoln County site, located 14 miles south of Sioux Falls, will start at 2 p.m.

The penitentiary tour is not open to the media or the public “for security and logistical” reasons, the meeting agenda says. Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who will chair the work group, said there are too many people already to add media to the mix.
The media will be able to tour the penitentiary in the weeks between now and July 22, Venhuizen told Searchlight. 
“We’re very open to the idea of, at some point, coordinating another tour for media members,” Venhuizen said, adding that he’d need to check in with Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko to find a suitable time.
The group’s first session will continue Thursday at 8 a.m. at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls with a series of informational sessions on inmate job training, behavioral health, prison industries and re-entry programs. A public comment period will start at 12:30 p.m. that day.
Critics: Site could be wrong
Neighbors to the site of the now-paused prison project sued the state because it didn’t ask for the county’s permission to build there. They lost at the local level, and the state Supreme Court heard arguments on their appeal last week.
The plaintiffs are constituents of House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton, who voted against funding the project this year. She’s also appeared at the group’s public events. She’s now one of 11 lawmakers on the 22-member work group.
The $55 million spent on that site gives Lems heartburn. Lawmakers approved $62 million for prison planning in 2024, but Lems said the executive branch spent more than it should’ve, given that the Lincoln County site lacked a final legislative blessing. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lems is encouraged that Rhoden’s office has committed to a “palms up” process for the meetings, and that the group’s been advised to “start from scratch.” 
But “the Lincoln County site is out there” and will need to be addressed.
“I don’t want to be the NIMBY person,” Lems said, using an acronym for “not in my backyard.” “But I do want to have a site that actually makes sense.”
Lems argues that some of the money spent for the site, such as the funds used to buy a stake in electrical and rural water infrastructure, won’t be completely wasted if the state can find a better plan. The rural customers will still benefit, she said.
The site “makes no sense to me at all,” she said. Rhoden called the site near Sioux Falls “a gift from God” because the state already owned the land, and because of its relative proximity to the interstate.
Backers: Find a way to yes
More than once during the 2025 session, Mehlhaff called on lawmakers to avoid “analysis paralysis” on the prison issue. The state hired a consultant, the DLR Group, to review its prison needs in 2021. A small group of lawmakers digested the findings and recommended a 1,500-bed prison the following summer, adopting the guidance of the Department of Corrections on the best path forward. 
There’s broad agreement that the state needs to do something, he said — and fast — to ease the overcrowding issues dissected throughout that report, he said. 
“I’m going to be focused on finding a solution rather than focusing on finding a problem that prevents us from finding a solution,” Mehlhaff said. “You can go down that rabbit hole, and that’s what was done before.”
Some opponents to the Lincoln County plan have zeroed in on the DLR report’s recommendations for multiple, smaller facilities across the state. Lawmakers funded a medium-security women’s prison in Rapid City nearly three years ago based on that report, and construction on that $87 million facility is ongoing.
Mehlhaff’s not convinced that smaller facilities for male inmates would make more sense than a centralized location.
“If you spread them out among four different places, you’ll have to duplicate programming, you’ll have to duplicate food service, you’ll have to duplicate prison industries,” he said, but added that he and every other member needs to be ready to hold preconceived notions in abeyance.
“We’re supposed to be taking a fresh look at it, right?”
Rehabilitation, safety questions 
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, led an effort to rename the Department of Corrections the “Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation” during the legislative session. The pitch sailed through the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives.
Smith, now a work group member, had hoped a name change would set a tone for the department. There is programming now, but Smith said the ideal is a department that focuses as much on preparing inmates to succeed on the outside as it does on housing them.
Name change for Department of Corrections falls flat on SD House floor

Smith said he intends to honor the group’s three stated goals, but hopes issues surrounding rehabilitation and finding ways to reduce the state’s long-term need for prison beds are in the mix.
“I do believe that we need to make sure that is the focus, and ultimately what we’re trying to do,” Smith said.
House Minority Leader Erin Healy, of Sioux Falls, is the work group’s other Democrat. She’s concerned about crowding and security in the 1881 facility. She got a letter recently from a Sioux Falls inmate concerned about safety in the current building, as well as a lack of access to rehabilitation and their ability to “live a dignified life.” 
During her last tour of the penitentiary, locked-down inmates let loose similar concerns as lawmakers walked by.
“They know that if you are with Secretary Wasko, you’re probably somebody who’s making decisions for them or our state,” Healy said. “That’s kind of what I witnessed last time.”
Law enforcement: We need to work with the DOC
The current penitentiary’s condition is top of mind for Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead as he prepares for the first work group meeting. He works closely with the DOC as the elected overseer of a county jail that serves as a pretrial waystation for future penitentiary inmates or parolees nabbed and detained for violations.
Milstead has questions about the price tag and the DLR report’s alternative options, but said “the aging facility up on top of the hill is in need of replacing.”
In 1998, the sheriff had a similar problem on his hands, though “on a much smaller scale.” His jail was old, inefficient and dangerous, he said, so he went to the public to ask for support. 
The Argus Leader newspaper’s photographers and cameras from local TV stations were invited to visit. That gave Milstead a chance to make the case that a new jail, built with room to expand in the future, would be preferable to upgrades at the old one.
Parole officers create specialty unit to target parolees in hiding

“I am so glad we did not try to cobble together the old jail above the public safety building,” Milstead said.
Yankton Police Chief Jason Foote heads the South Dakota Police Chiefs’ Association. He’ll represent local law enforcement on the work group. 
He’s hoping to learn more about how the DOC’s crowded facilities and operations might play into the system’s handling of the parolees his officers deal with regularly. He wants parolees held accountable for their actions, he said, which “can be pretty severe.”
Law enforcement “has a lot of interactions with those that have been in and are now out.”
“So I think it’s important to look at the recidivism, and what the prison system can do to maybe change some of the behaviors of people,” Foote said.
Like Milstead, though, he’s coming to the group without having gone through the legislative battles on what kind of facility the DOC might need. He hopes to offer a different perspective as a result.
“I’m coming in with an open mind,” Foote said. “I’m not biased either way.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)State health officials announced late Monday that they had confirmed a case of measles in a Pueblo resident.
It’s Colorado’s first confirmed measles case since 2023 and just its third case in the last nine years. It comes amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas that have caused at least one death of an unvaccinated child. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
In a press release, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the Pueblo case was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult who had “recently traveled to an area of Mexico experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak.”

Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and two doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provides about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. State law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, but allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
​​“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we know, but it is also highly preventable,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally. We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Based on initial information, CDPHE officials say that Pueblo residents who visited the Southwest Deli and Cafe at 1873 S. Pueblo Blvd. between March 17 and March 21, or the Southern Colorado Clinic at 109 South Burlington Drive on the afternoon of March 22, may have been exposed to measles. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

Brad Hudson, a Cape Fair Republican, listens during the first day of the 2025 legislative session — his first year as a state senator (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Legislation that would bar Missouri universities from penalizing student groups for their beliefs faced pointed criticism during a Monday evening House committee hearing from Democrats who say it would open the door for discrimination and hate speech.
“Some people call it ‘religious beliefs,’ and some people call it ‘discrimination,’” said state Rep. Elizabeth Fuchs, a St. Louis Democrat.
State Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, has sponsored the bill for four years. This is the first year he has presented it as a state senator, after it cleared the Missouri Senate for the first time last month. 
Hudson worked with Democratic senators and added a provision to the bill that carves out viewpoints that “would materially and substantially disrupt the educational environment or interfere with the rights of others” from protection, avoiding a filibuster that could have doomed the legislation’s chances.
Similar proposals have been heard in the state legislature for a decade, passing both the House and a Senate committee in 2022 and 2023.
A nearly identical bill already passed the House in February on a 108-47 party-line vote.

Hudson said the bill codifies legal precedent allowing student groups to enforce religious beliefs under the protection of the First Amendment. Passing the bill, he said, would help the state avoid “needless litigation.”
Curtis Cole, campus access specialist with Chi Alpha Campus Ministries from Springfield, said his group has been threatened with removal from campuses for “holding biblically based views and standards of leadership.”
He alluded to a situation at the University of Virginia, where a student was kicked out of leadership for being in a same-sex relationship. More recently, a Chi Alpha chapter in Texas became the target of a lawsuit after a student accused a staff member of sexual assault. The staff member was a registered sex offender during his employment with Chi Alpha.
Cole said the bill was important to protect a “marketplace of ideas” on college campuses although “we’re going to disagree with each other from time to time.”
Fuchs said it went beyond disagreement and instead infringes on the rights of LGBTQ+ students.
“You want one group to be able to organize, to not be discriminated against, even if they’re organizing and discriminating against others,” she said.
Lance Kinzer, director of policy and government relations for the Washington, D.C.-based 1st Amendment Partnership, said the bill holds up to court precedents.
“It mirrors constitutional protections, and it really is just common sense,” he said.
State Rep. Wick Thomas, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked whether the bill would allow for beliefs that discriminate against other people groups.
“Wouldn’t this bill theoretically open it up for discrimination based on any sincerely held religious belief?” Thomas said. “If people believe in eugenics, they might say disabled people are not allowed to be in leadership in this organization.”
Kinzer felt judicial rulings set reasonable bounds.
“I don’t see a scenario where this would allow discrimination based upon someone being handicapped,” he said. “That is status-based and not really belief-based.”

Wisconsin’s spring election takes place Tuesday, with voters across the state weighing in on the races for state Supreme Court and superintendent of schools, a constitutional amendment and local offices.
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Voters who are already in line to vote when polls close should remain in line and will still be able to cast their ballots. Absentee ballots must be returned by the time polls close and can be returned to a voter’s polling place or municipal clerk’s office. Information on polling places can be found at MyVote.WI.gov.
Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites have already cast their ballots, surpassing the early vote turnout of the 2023 Supreme Court race when 1.8 million people voted. On the Monday before the election that year, more than 409,000 ballots had already been cast. This year, more than 644,000 votes have already been cast, with Dane and Milwaukee counties each seeing the most turnout. More than 100,000 votes have already been cast in both counties.
While the lower turnout of spring elections means results usually come faster than in presidential elections, state law still doesn’t allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day. Last year, Republicans in the state Senate killed a bill that would have allowed absentee ballots to start being processed on the Monday before the election. This means that especially in Milwaukee, where all absentee ballots are processed and counted at one central count location, results may take longer to come in.
Supreme Court race
The race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is the most consequential on the ballot on Tuesday, with the ideological balance of the body up for grabs. Liberal-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford is taking on conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. The winner will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Wisconsin is holding the first statewide election in the country since President Donald Trump was elected last November. That opportunity to test the voting public’s mood, and the $20 million that Trump adviser Elon Musk has pumped into the race to support Schimel, has turned the race into a referendum on the first months of the second Trump administration.
Musk appeared at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday night to advocate for Schimel, give $1 million to two attendees and hype up his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been making drastic cuts to federal agencies and programs.
Schimel has said he is running to remove partisanship from the Court and that if elected he would  treat Trump like any other litigant in a case. But he also told a group of canvassers associated with Trump-aligned Turning Point USA that he’d be a “support network” for Trump on the Court and, the Washington Post reported, told a group of Republicans in Jefferson County that Trump was “screwed over” by the Court when it ruled against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of  the 2020 election.
Democrats and Crawford’s campaign have accused Musk of attempting to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court. They point to Musk’s current litigation in Wisconsin challenging a state law that prevents Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Democrats have held People v. Musk town halls across the state where attendees said they were worried about DOGE’s cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and education.
At the only debate between the two candidates in March, Crawford called her opponent “Elon Schimel.” Crawford has said if elected she’ll be a justice who seeks to protect the rights of all Wisconsinites while Schimel has said he’s running to counter the alleged partisanship of the Court since liberals won a majority in 2023.
The race for Supreme Court has set the record for most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. The race recently surpassed the $100 million mark, nearly doubling the record set by Wisconsin’s 2023 Supreme Court election when more than $50 million was spent in the race between Justice Janet Protasiewicz and former Justice Dan Kelly.
While the race has been nationalized, the winner will hold a deciding vote in cases that could decide how Wisconsin’s congressional maps are drawn, how pollution is regulated, the collective bargaining rights of the state’s workers and if Wisconsin women have the right to access an abortion.
Superintendant of Schools
Also on the ballot on Tuesday is the race for superintendent of schools. The race is between incumbent Jill Underly, supported by the state Democratic party, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant who’s been backed by the state Republican Party.
The two candidates appeared together at just one virtual forum, with Underly declining to attend a number of proposed events. Kinser has criticized Underly’s effort to change the standards used to assess student progress and advocated for more support for the state’s “school choice” programs including taxpayer-funded private school vouchers.
Underly is endorsed by the state’s teachers union and says she will defend  public schools against privatization efforts by school choice advocates such as Kinser.
Voter ID amendment
Voters will also weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to codify the state’s voter ID law. The Republican-authored proposal would require that voters provide a photo ID to register to vote, which is already the law. Republicans say the amendment is necessary to prevent the state  Supreme Court from striking down the voter ID requirement. Republicans have increasingly used the constitutional amendment process in recent years as a way to shape state law, avoiding Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)School districts across the state are starting to issue “pink slip” notices to teachers and staff that they may be laid off, in what has become a difficult spring tradition in Alaska, as legislators debate how much the state will allocate to education funding next school year. 
The Kenai Peninsula School District is among those districts, issuing notices for 160 teachers and staff starting this week, Superintendent Clayton Holland told lawmakers on Monday. 
School district officials and advocates from around the state testified before a joint hearing of the House and Senate education committees, discussing a variety of issues and priorities of districts, including the cost of staff retention, recruitment and turnover.
“Because we’re not certain what our budget will be,” Holland said in an interview after the hearing. “And just like all districts, we can’t afford to be wrong. We can’t jeopardize our fiscal future, or the fiscal stability of our district, by overdrawing (from district savings). So right now, we’re in a holding pattern.” 
Legislators in the Senate are considering a bill passed by the Alaska House of Representatives earlier this month which would provide a $1,000 boost to per student funding. The actual amount of the increase would be higher based on factors included in the funding formula, including the size of schools and special needs. The bill is currently being heard in the Senate Education Committee. 
Holland said the district calculated the 160 staff positions that received notices based on an estimated $680 increase in per student funding, the amount included in the current budget as a one-time addition. “And so even with that $680 (increase) we’re uncertain,” he said. “We don’t know. And it’s a risk at this point.”
Holland said that while school districts grapple with budget uncertainty every year, this year is more dire because districts have less in savings, there is less interest from teachers in applying to Alaska positions, and schools face teacher shortages already. 
“I think maybe back in the old days, people would wait it out, the job was worth waiting for, and there are enough people looking for jobs. But right now that’s not the case,” Holland said. “People go elsewhere and find jobs. They’ll leave our state and look for jobs. They’ll go to places that have a retirement system, have no fiscal instability, and leave us. And then it leaves us in June, looking for people who don’t exist.”
Alaska schools began the school year with over 600 certified teacher vacancies, according to a joint position statement from the Alaska Council of School Administrators, and some Alaska schools did not have a single certified teacher on the first day of school.
The council provides professional development and advocacy for Alaska educators statewide. It urged state action to address the “dire vacancy rates” by providing competitive salaries, benefits and a defined benefit retirement option.
“Our goal is to attract and retain qualified educators, and we look at why they are leaving,” said Lori Rucksdashel, principal of Chinook Elementary School in Anchorage and president of the Alaska Association of Elementary School Principals, testifying to lawmakers. 
“What we know is nine out of 10 teachers hired each year are replacing colleagues who left voluntarily,” she said. “More than two-thirds of teachers quit before retirement.” 
She said that the challenges are greater at schools that serve lower-income communities and receive federal Title I funding, adding that their turnover rates are 50% higher than other schools, and 70% higher in math and science.
Rucksdashel cited research from the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Social and Economic Research that estimates the turnover cost per teacher at over $20,000, including costs for recruitment, hiring and training.    

  Researchers with the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates the turnover cost per teacher at over $20,000 (Screenshot of presentation to a joint session of the House and Senate education committees)
 

She said the lack of retirement benefits is one of the driving forces for teachers leaving. “They are leaving because of the lack of defined benefits. They are leaving because of better opportunities in the Lower 48. They are leaving because of the cost of living, and right now, they are leaving because of uncertainty of educational funding.”
Rucksdashel told lawmakers she gave notice to staff at her elementary school that same morning, including a school nurse, a story she shared with her permission. “I spoke with my nurse, who is not only a professional in her field, but a parent of three students in my school. She chose to be a school nurse because she wanted to provide for Alaska’s children as well as be with her family,” she said. “This morning, I displaced her. She is not going to wait around until we decide that we have the funding to bring her back.”
On Monday, the Anchorage School District issued an estimated 360 notices to teachers and staff, to address a $43 million shortfall. The district pledged to reverse those cuts if the Legislature passed a $1,000 per student funding increase, according to the Anchorage Daily News. 
This year, school districts around the state are grappling with budget shortfalls and school closures and consolidations, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Kodiak and Ketchikan. 
Rick Dormer, principal of Ketchikan High School and president of the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals, told lawmakers Monday that he himself is actively applying for jobs in Oregon. 
“Because if I go to Oregon, I can get a defined benefit package, I can have higher wages, I can have a lower cost of living, and I don’t have to take the time and expense to get on a Boeing jet to see my family,” he said. “It is a challenge. We want to stay. I want to stay, but we’re also highly educated professionals. We have personal goals. We have professional goals. And I can tell you that there are a lot of options out there.”
Dormer said the ACSA is working to deter turnover with mentorship, networking and leadership training opportunities for educators around the state. But he urged legislators to take action and increase per student funding. 
“That’s public schools, that’s charter schools, that’s homeschools …. Every school needs quality leadership and quality teachers, and Alaska is losing their educational leaders at a very rapid rate,” he said. “Please help our children, every child, every day, to have access to the very best education possible from effective teachers and experienced, supported principals.”
In the meantime, the Senate Education Committee is hearing the school funding bill proposed by House legislators, House Bill 69, and will consider amendments. If the committee advances the bill, it would move to the Senate Finance Committee before going to a full vote in the Senate. If passed by the Senate, it would then go before Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who could sign it, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. Dunleavy and his legislative allies have said that any school funding increase should be accompanied by policy changes he has proposed, including expanding charter schools.

Pictured: The Lowry Ave Bridge over the Mississippi River. Photo by Getty Images. The Minnesota Legislature is in session, and it is a budget year, so state and local taxes are a big part of the deliberations. 
Many cite taxes in surrounding states, which are lower than those in Minnesota, to argue that we should lower our taxes to achieve the sort of prosperity surrounding states enjoy. 
This updates the data from a 2023 article, also published by the Minnesota Reformer. The purpose here is to demonstrate that there is evidence that higher taxes in Minnesota do buy us benefits not enjoyed by residents of surrounding states.  
Are Minnesota taxes significantly higher? 
As shown in the chart, state and local taxes in Minnesota are indeed higher than those in surrounding  states. The tax burdens include state income taxes, local and state property taxes, sales taxes, business taxes, and others like cigarette and gasoline taxes. Data for 2022 is the latest available. 

Consider a household paying the average tax rate on $80,000 of annual income. A Minnesota family  would pay about $3,000 more than a family with the same income in South Dakota. That same Minnesota family would pay about $850 more each year than a family living in Iowa or Wisconsin. 
Have Minnesota taxes always been higher than those of the other states? Prior to 2010, Wisconsinites had a higher tax burden than Minnesotans. (More on this later.) Residents of the other states have consistently faced lower tax burdens than Minnesotans. 
When compared to our previously reported 2021 data, tax burdens dropped by about 0.3% of income in all of the states except North Dakota, which rose from 7.9% to 8.8%.
Are there differences in prosperity across the five states?
Table 1 compares 2021 annual median household incomes in the five states. Middle income Minnesota households enjoy higher incomes than those in surrounding states.  
The Minnesota median household income is more than 15% higher than Iowa’s and South Dakota’s. The  median household in Wisconsin has over $10,000 less income than the median household in Minnesota. North Dakota’s median is closest to that in Minnesota, but still 10% less. 
Maybe surprisingly, all of the states bordering Minnesota have lower median income than that of the median family in the United States. Minnesota’s median exceeds the U.S. median by 9%. 
Of course, these incomes are all pretax, so Minnesota’s higher income is offset by Minnesota’s higher  tax burden. For example, our hypothetical median Iowa household would have about 15.6% less income  ($13,653) than the Minnesota household offset by tax savings of about 3.7% of that income ($3,150), for  a net difference of roughly 12% (about $10,500). 

Is Minnesota’s Prosperity a result of the higher taxes? 
First, consider the possibility that the income comparison above is simply an oddity. Table 2 shows the relationship of Minnesota median income to surrounding states’ incomes and the national median for two years prior to the pandemic. Minnesota’s median income has exceeded that in all surrounding states and the U.S. in all three reported years, and we see this consistently since 2000. While the relative numbers change from year to year, incomes in surrounding states except the Dakotas are not converging to incomes in Minnesota. 
Comparisons with North Dakota and Wisconsin deserve attention. North Dakota had very low income relative to Minnesota and its other neighbors in 1999, but not in 2012 and 2023. That relatively low income in 1999 was consistent with North Dakota in other years around 1999. The increased income after 2000 likely reflects development of the oil fields. 
In 1999, Wisconsin income was essentially the same as Minnesota’s. That was true prior to 2010. For example, in 1995, median income in Wisconsin was higher than that of Minnesota. As noted earlier, the tax burden in Wisconsin was higher than Minnesota’s until the early 2000s. As Wisconsin’s tax burden declined so did its income relative to its neighbors and the nation as whole.

At least since the early years of this century, Minnesota’s middle-income households had higher incomes than surrounding states. Minnesota is the only state with a consistently higher median income than the U.S. as a whole. So, the higher incomes in Minnesota are not an oddity; it’s been this way for awhile. 
Finally, can we relate the higher taxes to the higher income and possibly other social characteristics?  Table 3 considers some indicators of poverty, health care, education and crime that would seem to reflect relative public investments and residents’ opportunities to generate higher incomes.
Minnesota and our surrounding states all have overall and youth poverty rates lower than  the U.S. rates. Minnesota has the lowest overall rate of the five. Our youth poverty rate is less than all but North Dakota’s. The differences here are significant. If Minnesota had Wisconsin’s overall poverty rate, about 80,000 more Minnesotans would live in poverty. If Minnesota had South Dakota’s overall poverty rate, about 140,000 more Minnesotans would live in poverty. That is almost twice the population of Duluth. Unfortunately, poverty rates of the young folks exceed overall poverty rates in all states. 

Only South Dakota’s health care coverage falls well short of that of the other states in this comparison, just shy of the coverage rate of all Americans. 
Minnesotans complete high school at rates similar to surrounding states. A significantly higher proportion of Minnesotans have gone on to complete bachelor’s degrees than folks who live in the  other states. Minnesota’ higher incomes reflect past educational opportunities and achievements. The  higher incomes now improve current Minnesota students’ access to higher education. The quality of Minnesota’s K-12 education has provided another advantage: Minnesota students have the third highest college entrance exam scores in the country. 
Finally, Minnesota’s 2020 violent crime rate compares favorably to those in surrounding states and the country as a whole. South Dakota and Wisconsin are the only states with a higher violent crime rate than the U.S. as a whole. Violent crime rates in all of the states have dropped since 2021.
What conclusions can we draw? 
Minnesotans pay higher taxes than folks in surrounding states. The higher income of the Minnesota median household covers the extra taxes several times over. There is no indication that the incomes in states with lower taxes are catching up to Minnesota. Wisconsin, the only state to see a substantial income decline relative to both Minnesota and the U.S. has reduced its tax burden over the same period.  
Minnesota has lower poverty; a slightly higher proportion of its population with health coverage; better education outcomes; and lower violent crime rates. These achievements are all expensive. It is hard to conclude that our higher taxes did not make these achievements possible. 
I sought to test the ongoing claims that our taxes are higher than those around us, making us unable to compete with surrounding states. The first claim is true. The second is not. In fact, the extra taxes appear to be a net benefit to Minnesotans. 
That Minnesota compares favorably with other states and the U.S. should not lead any of us  to complacency. 
Significant segments of Minnesota rural communities and cities have low incomes, high poverty, poor educational opportunities, and endure high crime. The results here do indicate that Minnesota puts its taxes to good use and could productively invest more in improving outcomes for every Minnesotan.

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Another legislative session brings another swing at reforming Nevada’s seemingly untouchable property tax structure.
Among this year’s proposals: Letting voters in 2028 decide whether the taxable value of property should reset when a home is sold.
Currently, it does not, meaning the benefits of a depreciation factor and abatements used when calculating property tax stays with a home after it is sold to a new owner.
Assembly Joint Resolution 1, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson, proposes changing that by essentially establishing a reset button on property taxes whenever a home is sold. The resolution requires amending the state constitution, meaning it must  pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions (this year and 2027), then go before voters for final approval in the 2028 general election.
If approved by voters, the change would result in significantly more money for local governments and school districts, who rely on property tax for funding, without changing the state’s tax rate or the beloved tax cap that limits the increase of homeowners’ tax bills to no more than 3% a year  regardless of how large the increase in property valuation.
Anderson told lawmakers on the Assembly Revenue Committee, which heard the bill Thursday, that the change is needed because the state’s property tax structure “is complex, cumbersome, not efficiently used and most importantly not meeting the needs of our local communities.”
To illustrate the inequities created by the current property tax structure, Anderson’s co-presenter, Dylan Shaver of New Day Nevada, highlighted two properties in Carson City that, as of last week, were listed for sale.
The first, a 3,500-square-foot historic mansion listed for $2.4 million, has an assessed value for property tax purposes of around $75,000. The second, a new build with just under 2,000 square feet of living space, is listed for $550,000 and an assessed value around $84,500.
For the municipalities serving both neighborhoods, this property tax structure “creates holes that cannot be resolved,” said Shaver. “We have painted ourselves in a corner that is very difficult to get out of.”
Nevada is the only state in the country that applies a depreciation formula to real estate, Anderson noted.
AJR1 would not remove the depreciation formula and would not affect any current homeowners.
“Certainly at that point of sale, the depreciation clock would restart,” said Shaver. “Realistically, that’s just how property value works under state law…”
The property tax rate for a home’s new owner would be baked into the home at the time of purchase — just as it is for purchasers of new homes.
Republican Assemblymembers Greg Hafen and Danielle Gallant said the end result is people paying more in property taxes.
Shaver, who previously worked for the City of Reno and whose current clients as a lobbyist include the City of Las Vegas and the Washoe County School District, noted that property taxes pay for municipal services like sewers, roads, police, fire and schools.
“The thing that funds all of that is property taxes,” he said, which is a problem because property tax is “linked to a ticking clock that ticks ever downward.”
Sparks Mayor Ed Lawson, a longtime critic of the state’s property tax system, said his city’s expenses have increased 54% in the last five years while revenue has gone up only 16%.
“I challenge any of you to run any kind of government or business with those kinds of numbers,” he said.
In a letter he submitted to committee, Lawson wrote that the 2005 Legislature implemented property tax caps as an emergency response to rapidly rising property values and said they intended to study the property tax statutes for a longer-term solution.
Then, the Great Recession began, devastating local government budgets. No significant changes were ever made.
Calen Evans, president of the Washoe Education Association, which also supports the resolution, called the current property tax structure “regressive and frankly absurd.”
“It shields the wealthiest property owners and starves the public services our communities rely on,” he added. “They weakened the systems meant to support us. Nowhere is that more obvious than in education.”
Other education advocates pointed to the Commission on School Funding, which has identified property tax and sales tax reform as the clearest ways to boost the state’s education funding to national average.
The resolution also saw support from groups representing municipalities and their workers, including the Nevada League of Cities & Municipalities and the Urban Consortium, which includes the cities of Las Vegas, Henderson, Reno and Sparks.
“I don’t like to pay for anything I don’t have to either,” said Todd Ingalsbee, a lobbyist for the Professional Firefighters of Nevada, “but the fact is we have to invest in ourselves, we have to invest in our communities.”
The Retail Association of Nevada is also supporting the resolution on the grounds that when local governments cannot raise the revenue they need, they often turn to raising licensing or business fees.
Those in opposition, which include Nevada Families for Freedom, the Nevada Republican Party, and Nevada Realtors, argued that people are paying enough in taxes and that the change would further strain the housing market.
 Previous attempt fizzled

Anderson’s resolution is nearly identical to 2017’s Senate Joint Resolution 14, which was sponsored by then-state Sen Julia Ratti. Ratti’s resolution passed the full Legislature in 2017 but was not reconsidered and passed again  during the 2019 session. If it had, it would have appeared on the  2020 ballot.
In 2017,the Legislature commissioned a report from Applied Analysis to analyze the expected revenue impact of Ratti’s proposal. In an exhaustive 377-page report, the researchers documented that resetting the property tax’s assessed value after a sale would result in $13.2 billion in additional revenue over a 12-year period. 
That estimate includes nearly $3.2 billion for the state’s education budget, $601 million for Clark County and $75.4 million for Washoe County.
A more recent analysis, conducted by the City of Reno in support of AJR1, estimated a reset of property tax after the sale of 4,000 parcels sold in the city in the last fiscal year would have brought in an additional $11.9 million in property tax revenue.
The City of Reno’s share of that would have been approximately $3.9 million. The State of Nevada, Washoe County, and the Washoe County School District also would have benefitted, though the city’s memo did not include what their share was estimated at.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 08:59:26.573863

(Jonathan Peterson for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana legislators might put portions of a constitutional amendment overhauling state budget and tax policies back on the ballot, even after voters overwhelmingly rejected the wide-ranging proposal in Saturday’s election. 
On Monday, Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, said she was already working on drafts of new constitutional amendments that would make some of the same budget and tax changes in the failed Amendment 2 from Saturday. 
“I think you will definitely see some of this reborn in the session,” Emerson said in an interview, later adding, “I think it is just how we package it, and how many instruments we have with it,”

The legislators’ annual lawmaking session starts April 14, and any proposed amendments to be considered need to be filed quickly. The deadline to request legislative staff to write up new amendment legislation is noon Tuesday.

“We are all scrambling to get constitutional amendments redrafted again,” Emerson said. 
Yet asking the public to reconsider portions of the budget and tax proposal might also be a gamble. Despite a heavy push from Gov. Jeff Landry and some state legislators to approve it, 65% of voters rejected Amendment 2. 
In its original form, the proposal would have made dozens of changes to Louisiana’s tax and spending policies, including capping the maximum potential state income tax rate at a lower level and placing new constraints on legislators’ ability to increase state spending. 

It would also have made it more difficult for lawmakers to enact new tax breaks while giving them more state money to spend by diverting hundreds of millions of dollars from savings accounts to the state general fund, where the dollars can be used more freely. 
Also, public school teachers and school support staff were expected to see pay stipends of $2,000 and $1,000, respectively, they’ve received for the past two years become permanent if the amendment passed. Seniors 65 and over would have seen their standard state income tax deduction double in 2026. 
Lawmakers had overwhelmingly voted to put Amendment 2, sponsored by Emerson, on the ballot for voters. Out of 144 lawmakers in the Senate and House, only 11 voted against the measure during a special legislative session devoted to tax policy last November. 

But neither Landry nor legislators embarked on campaigns to educate the public about the amendment. Efforts to get out the vote in support of the initiative until the beginning of March, about two weeks before early voting started. 
Voters balked at the length and complexity of the proposal, which had run 115 pages as a piece of legislation. Others didn’t feel comfortable voting on one amendment with so many changes that were unrelated to one another. 

“It was too much. It was complicated and it didn’t give people options,” said Sen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge, who had helped Emerson write the Amendment 2 legislation. 
Emerson said items she would like to put before the voters again include the larger income tax deduction for seniors 65 and older as well as the rerouting of revenue from state savings accounts to its general fund. Had Amendment 2 passed, the Landry administration wanted to use the money to pay for further cuts to the state income tax rate in the upcoming session. 

Lawmakers lowered income taxes for most Louisiana residents just a few months ago, when they adopted a 3% flat income tax in exchange for a higher sales tax. Landry and Republican lawmakers want to eventually eliminate the income tax altogether but need another steady source of state funding to do so. 
Foil said he would also like to look at changes that could be made to local property taxes on business inventory. 
Amendment 2 would have triggered financial incentives for parish officials to phase out or lessen their inventory taxes. Conservative lawmakers have long wanted to get rid of the tax, which costs the state government money because it partially reimburses businesses for the expense through a state tax credit. 

Changes to the inventory tax wouldn’t necessarily require a constitutional amendment and could be made through a regular statute that does not require voter approval, Foil said. 

“That’s something we are having conversations about this week, what we might still be able to address,” Foil said. 
What remains unclear is what will happen with teacher compensation. 
The strategy for making the existing teacher and school support stipends a part of their permanent pay involved draining existing state education trust funds and using the money to pay down retirement system debt. 

Even if another constitutional amendment including this strategy was proposed, it wouldn’t go before voters before lawmakers have to address teacher salaries for next year. 
That means that teachers and school staff risk seeing their pay cut for the academic year that starts July 1 unless Landry and legislators move money around to keep the extra $2,000 and $1,000 in place for them. 
Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said lawmakers will have to decide whether they want to cut other programs and services to keep teachers and school support staff pay whole. The stipends cost approximately $200 million annually. 

“If [lawmakers’] priorities are the teachers’ stipends, then I’m going to have to know it,” said McFarland, who oversees the building of the budget as the House Appropriations Committee chairman. 
Emerson and other lawmakers did not say when they would put constitutional amendments on the ballot again. There are no major statewide elections scheduled for the rest of the year, and scheduling another would cost millions of dollars. 

Another round of constitutional amendments concerning budget and taxes might face less organized opposition. At least part of the pushback to Amendment 2 was fueled by concern for Amendment 3, a measure to weaken juvenile justice protections. 

Amendment 3, which failed on a 66-34 vote split, drew ire from national anti-incarceration groups, resulting in resources for an opposition campaign to Amendment 2 as well. If a similar hot-button measure isn’t on a future ballot, turnout to vote against tax and budget proposals might not be as high.

(Getty Images)Hundreds of lawful permanent residents in Nevada will lose access to critical services that help immigrants become U.S. citizens after $300,000 in federal funding was pulled from the state last week.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the agency has cut all grants awarded through its Citizenship and Integration Grant Program in response to a March 21 agency-wide directive by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “restrict grant funding to sanctuary cities.”
“It’s no secret that many organizations funded by USCIS grants over the years actively undermined the rule of law and integrity of our nation’s immigration system by supporting sanctuary cities and open borders,” said a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in an email Monday.
The term “sanctuary city” often describes jurisdictions with law enforcement agencies that refuse to some degree to cooperate with ICE.  While there is no standard definition, the Center for Immigration Studies, whose research is often cited approvingly by anti-immigrant activists and politicians, does not include any Nevada jurisdictions among its inventory of “sanctuary cities.”
The Asian Community Development Council — based in Las Vegas and Reno — was notified on March 27 that the USCIS decided to permanently terminate a $300,000 grant awarded to the nonprofit in November. The funding would have provided citizenship education classes and services to more than 200 individuals during the 24-month grant period.
“These classes would have provided rigorous background on U.S. history and government, and the naturalization process. The program was designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the naturalization process and obtain U.S. citizenship,” said Vida Lin, president and founder of the Asian Community Development Council in a statement.
The Asian Community Development Council was one of 43 organizations across 23 states to receive a Citizenship and Integration Grant from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024, for a total of about $12.6 million in federal funding nationally. 
Lin said if the grant is not reinstated it will jeopardize services in Nevada that help lawful permanent residents become U.S. citizens, including application assistance, English language instruction and civics education. 
Since the Asian Community Development Council was first established in 2015, it has grown to meet several community needs. The nonprofit has supported immigrant communities in Nevada through food assistance, health insurance enrollment assistance, college readiness boot camps for local youth, and community events like the Asian Night Market, which showcases local Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander -owned businesses.
However, the nonprofit has recently had to reduce its staff members “due to the uncertainty of funding at all levels,” said Lin. 
“This is the harsh reality that many nonprofits across Nevada and our country are facing currently as we try to navigate this new administration. Nevadans will continue to lose access to services and jobs due to decisions like the one DHS made last week,” Lin said. 
The Citizenship and Integration Grant Program was first established in 2009 under president Barack Obama’s administration as a way to tackle the backlog of U.S. citizenship applications and administrative burdens. 
In a letter earlier this month to the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Democratic House members — including Nevada Rep. Dina Titus — said the grant funded vital services that helped reduce the naturalization backlogs in recent years.
According to the letter, the grant program has helped reduce errors and delays for lawful permanent residents seeking U.S. citizenship by equipping eligible applicants with the tools to navigate the naturalization process more effectively. 
“Cutting funding for this program will only increase administrative inefficiencies and add to existing case backlogs,” reads the letter.
However, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary characterized the grant program as a “gravy train” that could potentially support unauthorized immigration.
“Taxpayer funded programs that that (sic) support, or have the potential to support, illegal immigration through funding illegal activities or support for illegal aliens are out of step with the President and Secretary Noem’s priorities — as well as common sense. The gravy train is over,” said a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in an email Monday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2165424518-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 11:08:57.512995

But, as President Donald Trump took office, one of his first actions was to freeze it, along with other Green New Deal efforts.
But, are the plans to eliminate the legislation in line with his goals to reduce energy prices? According to a study by clean energy experts, no.
The U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, opening doors for more federal tax credits and funding for clean energy technologies and manufacturing. Repealing the grants, tax credits and funding associated with the legislation would add about $50 to the average household’s energy bill a year by 2035 nationwide, according to a study by Energy Innovation, a clean energy and climate think tank.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Utah, annual energy bills would be $20 more expensive per household by 2030. By 2035, that number would rise to $120 per year, said Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation.
“When you get rid of these tax credits, you get less clean energy deployed, and you get less investment in clean energy and energy technology manufacturing, like batteries and EVs and solar panels,” Orvis said. “Because wind and solar don’t have fuel costs, they’re basically free to run once you build them. And so the more wind and solar you deploy, up to a point, the more you lower energy bills, because energy bills are heavily tied to those fuel costs to run different power plants.”
Even with an expanded oil and gas production, Orvis said, energy bills are poised to rise under these federal changes. 
Additionally, while big oil companies have expressed excitement about the government’s investment in fossil fuels, they are less enthusiastic about Trump’s call to “drill, baby, drill” and increase production, since doing so could mean a decrease in prices, and their profits, according to Bloomberg. 
Coal, which has become a more expensive resource over time, may make a comeback under the Trump administration, but, according to The Washington Post, it may be temporary.



Let us know what you think...


 


While Utah will undoubtedly see an economic impact from less clean energy investment, it won’t be as much as other states that have made substantial efforts to phase out fossil fuels and would have to procure energy at higher prices without the incentives, Orvis said.  
Utah has heavily relied on resources like coal to produce electricity, passing legislation to protect the state’s coal-powered plants and vowing to keep a distance from blue states’ strategies to set ambitious clean energy targets.
A prime example are Colorado households, whose energy bills would see the biggest effect by 2030. According to the study, their prices would rise $180 annually. Other states would start seeing dramatic hikes by 2035. By then Missouri families would be the most affected, having to pay $640 more for their energy expenses per year.
With less investment in clean electricity and clean energy manufacturing, Utah would also lose 7,300 jobs by 2030 and 6,100 by 2035, carrying other consequences to the state’s economy, Orvis said.
“That means less GDP growth in Utah,” he said. “So we see a decrease in state GDP of $1.34 billion in 2030, and $1.29 billion in 2035.”
While Republican leaders, including Trump, have big hopes for the fossil fuel industry, citing affordability and reliability, a focus on drilling wouldn’t necessarily compensate for the job losses tied to stalling clean energy projects, Orvis said.
“You just don’t need that many hours to extract fossil fuels. Oil and gas companies have become very efficient at doing it, and so even with some increase in fossil fuel production, you still have enormous job losses,” he said.

Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said in an interview last week that even with the 2025 legislative session over halfway through, there is still time for lawmakers to approve a gambling package, but he just needs “a few more assurances.”
“I’ve got folks, two or three across the state, that need to be on board with this, but as far as number of votes, I think all we need is one, maybe two at the most,” Albritton said.

If introduced, Albritton said, the bill would be a “trimmed down” version of the legislation package approved last year, including a lottery, sports betting and regulation and 24% tax at Class II gaming, or electronic bingo, at six existing facilities. There would be no additional facilities that could open under the legislation.
Albritton also said he expects the draft legislation to bring in between $700-750 million in revenue.
“You won’t see anything that you haven’t already seen. This is a cut-and-paste job,” Albritton said.
If the legislation is introduced, it would throw one of the most divisive issues in Alabama politics into the waning days of the 2025 session. 
Alabama’s 1901 Constitution bans lotteries and gambling. Gambling that is legally present in the state is conducted in facilities authorized by local constitutional amendments or on land held in trust by the federal government for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally-recognized Indian tribe that operates casinos in Atmore, Montgomery and Wetumpka. The state is the last east of Mississippi without a lottery. 
Attempts to create a lottery or expand existing gaming have been derailed by fighting between different gambling interests; battles between the House and Senate over how gambling proceeds should be spent and deep divisions within the GOP caucus, which holds majorities in both chambers, over the issue. 
The Alabama House in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment and legislation to legalize a state lottery and gambling. The measure stalled in the Senate.
In the Senate, 20 senators voted for the constitutional amendment, one vote short of the three-fifths majority required for constitutional amendments. Albritton, who carried the package in the Senate, did not vote for it, citing concerns he was unable to address about the bills’ intent to regulate, not condone, gambling.  
Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer, who voted in favor of gambling legislation in 2021 but voted against the 2024 measures said in a phone interview that he still has not seen any gambling legislation and does not know how he’ll vote on it. He declined to answer whether he would support legislation similar to the 2024 bills.
“I just don’t know where I am at on this bill,” he said.
Alabama House members last year sharply criticized the Senate’s handling of the package, and House leadership has said the chamber will not take up its own bill this year. Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, one of the driving forces behind last year’s attempt to legalize gambling, said in an interview that any legislation would have to start in the Senate.
“If the Senate is able to pass a comprehensive gaming packaging this session, the House stands ready to receive it, review it, and develop a gameplay and move it forward,” Blackshear said.
A comprehensive package, Blackshear said, should address and increase fines for illegal gaming activity across the state, as well as the structure to enforce those new regulations.
Rep. Sam Jones, D-Mobile, who also worked on last year’s package, said he’s interested in learning more about how the revenue will be distributed, a point of contention between the House and Senate last year.

Tsigdinos)A sobering Lake Tahoe investigative journalism series by CalMatters arrived at an inopportune time for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA).  The deep dive into how public monies are used at Lake Tahoe landed as the agency comes before Nevada and California legislatures seeking millions of dollars for its operating budget. TRPA will be in Carson City on April 2.
As explained in an NPR CapRadio interview, a team of reporters spent months requesting and analyzing documents from the agency and submitting public records requests to federal, state and county sources. What came to light is that the Tahoe agency and a “myriad” of funders from both states and the five counties in the Tahoe basin along with deep-pocketed private interests (which include resort executives and developers on non-profit boards) have established a closed loop system for advancing pet projects. Items include: a consultant-generated rebranding of tourism as ‘sustainable’; photo opp summits; trail construction into once pristine shorelines and forests; and, despite a court order to cease and desist: poisoning water in the Tahoe Keys to ease boat access.
As one of the investigative journalists noted (audio time stamp 25.58) “they’re all giving money to each other through grants or what have you – it’s this very complex interwoven web that’s hard to dissect for sure.”  
That’s not to say TRPA doesn’t have annual independent financial audits of its operations. It does. The last occurred for the financial year ending June 2024. The CalMatters analysis goes beyond the agency’s day-to-day operations.
TRPA has been at the nexus of billions of dollars over decades. It reported: “About $581 million — slightly more than a third of the government and private money spent in the Tahoe region since 2010 — has funded recreation, transit, paved path and trail projects. Included is $40 million for a new sports and aquatics center. Those types of expenses are growing in recent years: Since 2015, they now amount to 43% of the funding, twice the share of the previous five years.”
Who are among the beneficiaries of new recreation attractions? Multinational resort operators like Vail Resorts; it offered up a vice president to join TRPA on a recent lobbying trip to Washington D.C. along with the head of the previously named North Lake Tahoe Resort Association and other Tahoe tourism representatives.
Nevada Current also found a bias to recreational spending when it investigated where dollars in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program were flowing. That reporting occurred as a bill introduced by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei and co-sponsored by Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made its way through Congress. Millions more became available to TRPA in September 2024 when the bill became law.

Spend any time on TRPA’s website and you’ll find all sorts of developer goodies including a development rights marketplace with developer incentives. In its development pipeline are new amenities for an older ski resort now owned by a commercial real estate development and investment firm.
The agency is also a founding partner of a cleverly devised tourism initiative designed to funnel money to private interests under the auspices of environmental improvement.
Government agencies with such scope, authority and funds at their disposal would typically answer to a full-time, comprehensive Office of Inspector General or comparable independent dedicated oversight division. This ensures agencies are in routine compliance and do not engage in ineffective, unethical or unlawful operations. Full-time oversight doesn’t exist for TRPA. However, it does have more “public-private” partnerships than you can count on two hands and highly paid executives who excel at PowerPoint presentations.
How’s Lake Tahoe doing?
While the agency works to combat aggressive aquatic invasive species entering Lake Tahoe, this effort becomes more difficult with new piers offered every two years.
The Tahoe Science Advisory Council peer review of the latest TRPA Environmental Threshold Evaluation called out deficiencies in data and lack of accounting for increasing wildfire activity with, among other things, “no mention of increasing wildfires on nitrogen emissions concentrations” (excess nitrogen in lakes is a major source of pollution), and inconsistencies in evaluation methods and metrics.
The academics put it this way: “The disconnect between some standards and management activities reinforces the need (identified by previous threshold evaluation reviews) to revisit the threshold standard system for air quality, noise, recreation, vegetation preservation, and water quality. Revisiting the threshold standards and the associated data sources is needed to ensure TRPA’s monitoring programs can best inform implementation actions and monitor the impacts of those investments.”
Meanwhile, the Tahoe Area Group Sierra Club noted Lake Tahoe has gained “international acclaim for its high microplastic levels, nearshore water quality severely impaired with algae and cyanobacteria blooms, toxic materials in the lake’s waters surpassing the EPA-approved limit by more than 2,500 times in the lake, and a trash problem that is now infamous around the world.”
TRPA has been briefed on microplastics but has initiated no action.
Compliance is not TRPA’s strong suit. The Tahoe Event Center in Douglas County opened in 2023 without onsite parking, meant to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Traffic count is one factor in determining VMTs, yet TRPA never followed up to see if the required vehicle counting monitors were installed (they weren’t).
And Tahoe infrastructure? According to the Tahoe City Public Utility District, much of Tahoe’s water infrastructure was built in the 1960s and the aging pipes “don’t meet today’s fire codes.” Yet that hasn’t stopped TRPA from amending ordinances to allow for higher density development. Developers are already marketing their Tahoe luxury properties.
Under the rubric of housing, TRPA rushed to loosen development standards for taller buildings, removed land coverage restrictions meant to filter and recharge rain and snowmelt that flow to the lake, and greenlit accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Tahoe county planners, in a moment of candor, allowed they expect ADUs will be turned into tourist accommodation units.
Gotta keep the tourists happy. But impacts to the Lake?
  Screenshot from TRPA’s Land Coverage 101
“With all the new projected development, all of the science in the world won’t save Lake Tahoe.” That was one of many serious public comments offered by a member of the Tahoe Environmental Research Council advisory board in the most recent TRPA governing board meeting.
There’s only 0ne Lake Tahoe
Lake Tahoe needs a truly science-based environmental enforcement and compliance agency. The Tahoe basin also needs a realistic update of the Tahoe basin’s carrying capacity. It’s time to amend TRPA codes to include specific modern-day thresholds such as wildfire evacuation, tourism/human capacity and traffic. Shouldn’t there be an accurate determination of how much more development and human impact Tahoe can safely accommodate?
Asking the same agency to both approve and police large new developments makes no sense. It cannot be both ‘judge and jury’ and expect that the public and environment’s interests will be best served.
What was the response to the investigative reporting on how far TRPA had strayed from its watchdog focus? TRPA doubled down on how much it values development and tourism. One public servant, TRPA’s governing board member and Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill, dismissed the report outright as “misinformation” and diminished the award-winning media outlet as “quote unquote journalism.”
Despite TRPA and its partners’ spin, the public doggedly continue to express valid concerns to TRPA’s governing board and Nevada’s legislators.

The National Weather Service is reducing the number of weather balloons it launches across the country, an early tangible decrease in services offered in the wake of cuts by the Trump administration.
The NWS, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, announced last week that it was halting or reducing weather balloon operations at 11 locations, citing staffing shortages.
The NWS uses these weather balloons, until recently launched twice per day from 100 total locations, to gather temperature, wind, pressure and other data from the ground up to approximately 100,000 feet. The results are compiled along with data from satellites, radar stations, surface weather stations, buoys and aircraft to build weather models and forecasts that are public and freely available.

Any weather forecast made available via broadcast news, a commercial app or other media is almost certainly derived from data and model computations made by the National Weather Service using weather balloons.
Michael Morgan, former assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction at NOAA and now a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said data from weather balloons is one of the fundamental inputs to climate and weather forecasting models.
“We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” Morgan said in a press conference Monday.  “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast.
“Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.”
Alan Sealls, longtime television meteorologist and president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, said that time will tell how much the loss of several balloon launch sites will impact the accuracy of those forecast models.
“It’s similar to constructing a steel-framed office building requiring a certain number of bolts,” Sealls said in an email. “Nobody can say how many bolts you can leave out or remove before the structural integrity is compromised.”
The National Weather Service did not respond to requests for comment on the balloon launches and how it would impact forecasting.
The agency’s announcement of the cutbacks said that radiosondes, the equipment on weather balloons, “are one of many technologies that collect earth observation data for weather modeling and forecasting. Data is also collected from instruments aboard commercial aircraft, surface observing stations, satellites, radars, and buoys.”
NOAA also said that the impacted offices would still perform “special observations as needed.”

DOGE cuts hamper models

The balloon launches were cut after NOAA announced hundreds of layoffs or voluntary resignations across the agency, including at the National Weather Service, as the agency fell into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk.
The cuts were announced in waves since staffing reductions took effect. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a press conference last week that about 650 NOAA employees were reportedly among those fired, and his former colleagues in the agency said that they had been ordered to “identify another 1,029 positions” for termination.
The NOAA firings have been challenged in court, and on March 13 a U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order instructing that impacted workers be reinstated. Those workers have since been put on administrative leave and have not returned to work, according to court filings.
Morgan said that because the orders targeted probationary workers—people who had been in their current role for less than two years—NOAA was losing many of its most promising young employees.
“Some of these probationary employees were actually new, early-career folks that have been bringing in a skill set that, frankly, I don’t have, and a lot of folks who have been at the Weather Service for a while don’t have,” Morgan said. “These are folks that know about Python, know about machine learning and data science, that were going to help move the Weather Service into this next generation of modeling and model development.”
NOAA said it has suspended all radiosonde launches until further notice at three stations: Kotzebue, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Rapid City, South Dakota.
NOAA also announced it was reducing launches to once per day at an additional six locations: Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska; and Riverton, Wyoming.
Launches from two other stations—Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine—have been temporarily suspended, but NOAA said the launches would resume twice per day “when staffing permits.”
In addition to impacts for immediate forecasting, Sealls said the loss of data history could create gaps for future researchers and model developers.
Despite the reductions, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center issued its spring weather outlook last week, which included critical drought warnings for the Colorado River, the Rio Grande and large portions of the southwestern United States.

How it works

The balloons are filled with helium to be roughly five feet in diameter and released at the same time from all participating weather stations, in what the Weather Service calls its Upper Air Observation network.
Once launched, each balloon carries a radiosonde, a device that collects data on temperature, dew point, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction.
The radiosonde transmits that data in one-second intervals as it rises through the atmosphere. A typical balloon flight lasts around two hours, and can reach altitudes over 100,000 feet and can drift more than 100 miles from the launch site, according to the Weather Service.
The balloon eventually bursts, and the radiosonde falls back to the ground with a parachute.
The NWS website says that despite the variety of other methods of collecting data, “the weather balloon remains the best platform for observing temperature, wind, relative humidity, and pressure above the ground.”
James Spann, a prominent television meteorologist in central Alabama, said those balloon flights are a crucial part of delivering local forecasts.
“That’s the input for the computer models,” Spann said. “And if you don’t have data at the input of these models, you get no output. So the upper air observation network is critical.”
According to the posted notices, NWS offices “will perform special observations as needed.”
Sealls said those special observations will be critical in severe weather events.
“Missing weather balloon data will become a big concern in threats of hurricanes, winter storms, ice storms, tornadoes and other severe weather because weather balloons offer detail above the ground that other instruments cannot match,” he said.

Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff last week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.
In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.
A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”

But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:
“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a column Kennedy wrote for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”
ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.
“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”
Alabama health officials investigate possible measles exposure

For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It promoted them with confidence. One campaign was called “Get My Flu Shot.” The agency’s website told medical providers they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”
Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.
Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.
When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”
“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”
Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”
The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.
Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.
In late February, for example, forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1 bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.
In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)
The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
Last week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”
The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”
Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.
During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after NPR reported this.
But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.
On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated child had died of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.
In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.
As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles.
Still, the CDC added an entry on Vitamin A to its measles website for clinicians.
On Wednesday, CNN reported that several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.
Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country will hinder their ability to respond to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.
Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.
This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.

Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

Santiago/Getty Images)Democratic lawmakers have revamped their approach to banning flavored tobacco products in Washington.
In new bills filed Friday in the state House and Senate, the original prohibition on flavored vapes proposed early in the legislative session is combined with an increase in cigarette taxes. The measure’s sponsor in the House, Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, said she hopes it becomes part of the smorgasbord of revenue measures Democrats are eyeing to fill the looming budget deficit.
The new legislation, House Bill 2068, revives the ambitious and controversial prohibition that had made little progress in Olympia so far this year. Supporters hope it can curb youth smoking, as studies show middle and high school students overwhelmingly favor flavored options.
Andrew Estep, the campaign manager for Flavors Hook Kids Washington, calls the new plan a “holistic approach to bettering the health of Washington residents.”
Critics of such bans have argued they would lead to increased cigarette use as consumers look for alternatives. And people who’ve turned to electronic cigarettes to quit smoking traditional cigarettes would no longer have flavored options. 
The ban on selling flavored e-cigarettes, also called vapes, and nicotine products, like menthol cigarettes, would begin July 1, 2027. The sale of nicotine pouches, like Zyn, to patrons under age 21 would also be prohibited.
The initial proposal, House Bill 1203, would have banned the products beginning 90 days after the legislative session ends. This new approach allows the state to continue earning sales tax revenue from the products amid a budget deficit as high as $16 billion over the next four years.
Flavored shisha, or hookah, tobacco would be exempt from the prohibition.
The bill also adds a $2-per-pack tax on cigarettes. That tax would rise with inflation. The first $5 million from the new tax would go toward preventing youth tobacco and vape use. The rest would go into the state’s general fund. 
It also adjusts how vapor taxes are collected, adjusting the rate so it’s based on the product’s price instead of the volume of liquid. Advocates say this will increase revenue, with money going to the Andy Hill Cancer Research Endowment Fund, foundational public health services and the general fund.
Reeves said Friday that if the Legislature is going to further tax these products, it should go toward funding “the social outcomes we want.”
The tax provisions would take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The goal is to offset the lost sales tax revenue from the banned products. 
Washington smokers already face one of the nation’s highest state cigarette taxes, totaling $3.77 between excise and sales taxes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

A separate cigarette tax proposal, also sponsored by Reeves, would increase the existing $3.03 excise tax on a 20-pack of cigarettes by 30 cents. For vape liquid, the tax on containers of 5 milliliters or more would go up a penny to 10 cents per milliliter, and the fee on other vapor products would rise three cents to 30 cents per milliliter.
The new legislation under consideration would also up the license fee for cigarette and vapor product distributors and retailers.
Businesses licensed to sell these products would be required to post signage noting the statewide ban. And the state Department of Health would run a campaign to build awareness about the harms of flavored tobacco products.
About half a dozen other states restrict flavored tobacco sales to varying degrees.
Since the proposal would bring in new tax revenue, it is considered “necessary to implement the budget” and so is immune from deadlines that have already killed numerous bills this session.
Sen. Noel Frame, the leading Democratic voice on new revenue this year, said the bill is intriguing not just because it generates money for the state but because “it’s good public policy.”
Reeves expects the bill to get a hearing from the House Finance Committee in the next couple weeks. If it doesn’t make it to the finish line this session, she sees the legislation as laying the groundwork for progress in 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vapes-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 08:03:28.442341

J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, speaks on the House floor on Jan. 30, 2024. (From Prescott's official Flickr page)Legislation adding political party affiliations to Indiana’s currently nonpartisan school board elections got one step closer to law Monday, when it narrowly earned House approval. The 54-40 tally included “no” votes from 14 Republicans and all 26 Democrats present.
Supporters maintained the locally chosen boards are already partisan.
“Just in the last few years, we’ve had issues that’ve been brought to the forefront … One party is saying it’s okay that biological males can compete with our daughters … in sports; another party is pushing against that,” began Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour. “One party thinks it’s okay to sterilize and mutilate children; another party is pushing against that. One party thinks it’s okay that we have pornography —”

Infuriated Democrats alleged a violation of the chamber’s rules, prompting a command from House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff for Lucas to “speak to the bill.”
“I think it’s important that we know who is running for our school boards (and) making decisions for our children that have been extremely controversial,” Lucas finished. “… This is an easy vote.”
Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, said Lucas’ remarks showed lawmakers are “injecting” politics into school board races “at a level that is truly beneath us.”
She also recalled that many supporters in committee were unsuccessful school board candidates who had lost in recent elections.
Pryor and other opponents — despite the vote, only Democrats spoke on Monday — asserted the changes would create or exacerbate the partisan divide.
“The whole premise of this bill is, ‘Ah, there’s politics in the schools. Let’s just put more politics in … and make everybody be a politician that runs for the school board,” said Rep. Chuck Moseley, D-Portage. “Well, I spent nine years on the school board, and … we kept politics out of that.”
Transparency and turnout
Sponsor Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, said Senate Bill 287 would “provide transparency” to voters and drive up Indiana’s infamously low turnout.
But Rep. Kyle Miller, D-Fort Wayne, asserted that it’d instead create “lazy voters and lazy candidates” who rely on partisan designations to do the work — of researching candidates and campaigning to community members — for them.

All 54 yes votes came from Republicans.
The 14 Republicans who joined 26 Democrats in opposition were: Reps. Ed Clere, Matt Commons, Mark Genda, Dave Hall, Dave Heine, Chris Judy, Matt Lehman, Ethan Manning, Chris May, Wendy McNamara, Julie Olthoff, Jim Pressel, Hal Slager and Greg Steuerwald.

Prescott later called the affiliations “just the starting point, not the ending point,” adding, “When you’re looking at Republican or Democrat on the ballot, you still have to go through and evaluate the candidates themselves for who they are.”
Rep. Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson, said Prescott “has done a great job to find a middle ground.”
The legislation requires nominating petitions to state the candidate’s political party affiliation, the candidate is independent of a party, or that the candidate choses to be listed as nonpartisan.
Partisan hopefuls would have letters next to their names on general election ballots, while independent and nonpartisan candidates would get blank spaces. Straight-ticket voting — in which voters can choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark — wouldn’t include school board elections. Hoosiers would still make each pick.
Forty-one states provide for nonpartisan school board elections, according to Ballotpedia. Five allow for either, depending on the district, and four do partisan elections. Indiana could soon join the latter group.
But Senate Bill 287 isn’t heading to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk just yet.
That’s because a House committee this month stripped the measure of its original language requiring school board candidates to run in primary elections like other candidates. Members replaced it with the general election designation, pulled from the long-dead House Bill 1230.
The Senate must concur with the House’s changes — or, the two chambers must agree on a compromise — before it exits the legislative process.

The proposal retains other partisan features, however. Candidates claiming affiliation with political parties would have to meet Indiana’s two-party rule: their most recent two primary votes must match the party they seek to represent. If not, they need a county party chair’s O.K.
That could block thousands of Hoosiers from running, along with a federal law barring employees from partisan activities.
The Indiana School Boards Association (ISBA) mourned the move Monday evening.
Executive Director Terry Spradlin said his organization has “fought against” the push for partisan school board elections for multiple years — but will adjust once it’s in effect July 1.
“Once elected, ISBA will encourage school board members to leave politics at the board room door by working collaboratively to focus on what is best for our 1 million public school students,” Spradlin continued, in a statement. “School board members should also conduct themselves in a manner that models effective board governance practices regardless of party affiliation.”
Another provision would raise board member pay from the current $2,000 maximum by tying compensation to 10% of starting teacher salaries. The state has a $40,000 minimum — which would double school board pay — but Braun wants to land at $45,000.

The Missouri House on Monday advanced legislation that would reinstate state-run presidential preference primaries and extend the no-excuse absentee voting period from two to six weeks.


Supporters of House Bill 126 cited a widespread positive response to the recently enacted no-excuse voting period as a motivating factor. They also noted negative feedback on the 2024 party-run caucuses, which replaced the state-run primaries after they were eliminated as part of a law passed in 2022.


The no-excuse absentee voting period has been in effect since August 2022 and allows voters to cast their ballot in elections in person or by mail starting two weeks before Election Day.
Supporters of the bill said they hoped that extending the no-excuse voting period would further alleviate stress on election workers and encourage voters to cast their ballot.
The state of Missouri ran March presidential primaries from 2000 until 2020. A 2022 law signed by former Gov. Mike Parson eliminated them. In 2024, the Republican Party held in-person caucuses in Missouri to select their delegates, while Democrats opted for a hybrid caucus with in-person voting and a mail-in ballot.
Low participation in these caucuses, alongside vocal blowback from residents who preferred the state-run primaries, were cited as motivators for reinstating the primaries.
“I believe it’s a lot simpler for our residents of our state going to cast a ballot like they do it in every other way for their preference for the presidential primary,” said state Rep. Brad Banderman, a Republican St. Clair.
Under the bill primaries would be held on the first Tuesday of March during presidential election years. The estimated cost to the state for conducting the primaries is $8 million.
The bill’s supporters also noted that unlike previous years, where the primary results have not been binding to party delegates, both political parties have agreed to adhere to the results for the first ballot at their respective party conventions.
The House needs to approve the legislation one more time before it heads to the Senate.

Supreme Court will decide if the state overstepped its authority in taking over Paterson police in 2023 after a controversial killing.,"Paterson officials say no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of their 300-officer force in 2023. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Almost two years after the state took over the troubled Paterson Police Department, attorneys argued before the New Jersey Supreme Court Monday over whether it had the authority to do so.
Paterson officials, who sued the state seven months after the March 2023 takeover, have asserted that no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of the 300-officer force. Instead, under home rule, only municipalities have direct operational oversight of local police departments, said attorney Christopher Gramiccioni, who represents Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh and other officials.
State officials, though, have cited several laws they say gave Platkin that authority. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zuckerman insisted the takeover, which came after a controversial and deadly police encounter, lies squarely within Platkin’s duties to ensure both public confidence in law enforcement and the uniform, efficient application of criminal laws statewide.
While a state appeals panel sided with Paterson in December, the rapid-fire questions the Supreme Court justices showered on Gramiccioni, Zuckerman, and other attorneys over two hours of arguments Monday suggests the appellate ruling might not stand.
Dominating the discussion were two state laws both sides cited to make their case — the 1970 Criminal Justice Act, which designated the attorney general as the state’s chief law enforcement officer, and a 2023 law known as Chapter 94 that state legislators passed after the Paterson takeover to facilitate it.
Gramiccioni argued that state legislators never intended to empower the state attorney general to seize control of municipal police departments because neither law explicitly spells out such authority. The Criminal Justice Act allows county prosecutors to take over local agencies, but only with the agency’s consent, he added.
Zuckerman countered that the attorney general’s takeover power is “strongly implied, if it’s not expressly granted.”
“If the attorney general can supersede a county prosecutor, and the county prosecutor can supersede municipally, it follows that the attorney general can supersede municipal law enforcement directly,” he said.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis pushed back on any claim that consent is needed.
“Where in the statutes does it tell us that there has to be consent in order for such supersession to occur?” she said.
Gramiccioni conceded consent isn’t expressly required by law.
The justices also zeroed in on Chapter 94, which authorized the attorney general, when superseding a law enforcement agency, to appoint an officer in charge who hasn’t completed training through the state Police Training Commission as long as the officer completes the training within one year of appointment. That became an issue when Platkin appointed Isa Abbassi, a New York Police Department veteran, to replace Paterson’s chief, Engelbert Ribeiro, after the takeover.
The law did not mention Paterson, but it might as well have, Justice Rachel Wainer Apter said. Under the law’s verbiage, it specifically applies to “a city of the first class having a population of less than 200,000 according to the federal 2020 decennial census,” she noted.
“It seems to say everything it could, aside from ‘the City of Paterson.’ How can you argue that this is actually not referring to this particular supersession, and is instead referring to some other possible supersession where it was consensual?” Wainer Apter said.
The justices noted as further proof of a Paterson link that while Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law in July 2023, legislators made it retroactive to March 1, 2023. Platkin announced his office’s takeover of Paterson on March 27, 2023.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner also pointed to state funding allocated to effectuate the Paterson takeover.
“So the Legislature authorized $18 million for the attorney general’s takeover of the Paterson Police Department, but you view that as — how does one view that if not actual validation and support for what the attorney general has done?” Rabner said.
Zuckerman backed up that sentiment, saying: “If the Legislature had felt our reading was the wrong one, they would have told us to knock it off, and instead, they partnered with us and helped support this particular supersession.”
Gramiccioni exhorted justices to weigh only the statutory language rather than inferring legislative intent through “collective sources of law.”
“I would submit this: It’s the law that holds the supreme power, not a monarch who is basically creating this out of thin air, on a whim, on when he can go in and supersede a municipal police department,” Gramiccioni said.
But Zuckerman urged justices to regard Chapter 94 and the state funding as proof of legislative intent that the attorney general has the power to take over police departments in rare, warranted cases, such as Paterson, where police have a long history of brutality and civil rights violations that local officials have failed to stop.
“Our Legislature has provided unusually striking evidence, not only that it understood and intended for supersessions like this one to be lawful, but also that it was working with the executive branch to help this very supersession succeed,” Zuckerman said. “That is fatal to the challengers’ position.”
Henal Patel, an attorney for the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice who argued Monday in favor of the takeover, told justices that supersession is an important tool legislators gave the attorney general to restore trust when police have broken it. She pointed to the deaths of several residents at the hands of Paterson police, including Najee Seabrooks, a community activist who officers gunned down after he called 911 for help during a mental crisis.
“The legislative intent here was to provide the AG with broad powers to rebuild public trust, including supersession powers, and New Jersey’s AG properly exercised that power,” Patel said. “I want to emphasize the stakes here. If this court were to affirm the appellate division’s opinion, the people of Paterson, especially its Black and brown residents, will be left without justice, and public trust would remain broken.”
Attorney Vito A. Gagliardi Jr., representing the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police, urged justices to set standards for supersession, saying police and municipal leaders deserve clarity on why the state would take over their force and advance notice when that occurs.
Zuckerman told the justices that while county prosecutors have taken over municipal police forces at least 17 times in recent decades, state takeovers of local police departments are historically rare in New Jersey. Besides Paterson, the attorney general’s office took over the embattled Camden police department in 1998, and that department disbanded altogether in 2013.
“This office has never done it other than those two times,” Zuckerman said. “So I think that tells you everything you need to know about how we view it as a break-the-glass kind of tool, as opposed to a just-do-it-because-you-feel-like-it kind of tool.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s spring election takes place Tuesday, with voters across the state weighing in on the races for state Supreme Court and superintendent of schools, a constitutional amendment and local offices.
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Voters who are already in line to vote when polls close should remain in line and will still be able to cast their ballots. Absentee ballots must be returned by the time polls close and can be returned to a voter’s polling place or municipal clerk’s office. Information on polling places can be found at MyVote.WI.gov. 
Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites have already cast their ballots, surpassing the early vote turnout of the 2023 Supreme Court race when 1.8 million people voted. On the Monday before the election that year, more than 409,000 ballots had already been cast. This year, more than 644,000 votes have already been cast, with Dane and Milwaukee counties each seeing the most turnout. More than 100,000 votes have already been cast in both counties. 
While the lower turnout of spring elections means results usually come faster than in presidential elections, state law still doesn’t allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day. Last year, Republicans in the state Senate killed a bill that would have allowed absentee ballots to start being processed on the Monday before the election. This means that especially in Milwaukee, where all absentee ballots are processed and counted at one central count location, results may take longer to come in. 
Supreme Court race
The race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is the most consequential on the ballot on Tuesday, with the ideological balance of the body up for grabs. Liberal-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford is taking on conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. The winner will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 
Wisconsin is holding the first statewide election in the country since President Donald Trump was elected last November. That opportunity to test the voting public’s mood, and the $20 million that Trump adviser Elon Musk has pumped into the race to support Schimel, has turned the race into a referendum on the first months of the second Trump administration. 
Musk appeared at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday night to advocate for Schimel, give $1 million to two attendees and hype up his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been making drastic cuts to federal agencies and programs. 
Schimel has said he is running to remove partisanship from the Court and that if elected he would  treat Trump like any other litigant in a case. But he also told a group of canvassers associated with Trump-aligned Turning Point USA that he’d be a “support network” for Trump on the Court and, the Washington Post reported, told a group of Republicans in Jefferson County that Trump was “screwed over” by the Court when it ruled against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of  the 2020 election. 
Democrats and Crawford’s campaign have accused Musk of attempting to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court. They point to Musk’s current litigation in Wisconsin challenging a state law that prevents Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Democrats have held People v. Musk town halls across the state where attendees said they were worried about DOGE’s cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and education. 
At the only debate between the two candidates in March, Crawford called her opponent “Elon Schimel.” Crawford has said if elected she’ll be a justice who seeks to protect the rights of all Wisconsinites while Schimel has said he’s running to counter the alleged partisanship of the Court since liberals won a majority in 2023. 
The race for Supreme Court has set the record for most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. The race recently surpassed the $100 million mark, nearly doubling the record set by Wisconsin’s 2023 Supreme Court election when more than $50 million was spent in the race between Justice Janet Protasiewicz and former Justice Dan Kelly. 
While the race has been nationalized, the winner will hold a deciding vote in cases that could decide how Wisconsin’s congressional maps are drawn, how pollution is regulated, the collective bargaining rights of the state’s workers and if Wisconsin women have the right to access an abortion.
Superintendent of Schools
Also on the ballot on Tuesday is the race for superintendent of schools. The race is between incumbent Jill Underly, supported by the state Democratic party, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant who’s been backed by the state Republican Party. 
The two candidates appeared together at just one virtual forum, with Underly declining to attend a number of proposed events. Kinser has criticized Underly’s effort to change the standards used to assess student progress and advocated for more support for the state’s “school choice” programs including taxpayer-funded private school vouchers. 
Underly is endorsed by the state’s teachers union and says she will defend  public schools against privatization efforts by school choice advocates such as Kinser. 
Voter ID amendment
Voters will also weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to codify the state’s voter ID law. The Republican-authored proposal would require that voters provide a photo ID to register to vote, which is already the law. Republicans say the amendment is necessary to prevent the state  Supreme Court from striking down the voter ID requirement. Republicans have increasingly used the constitutional amendment process in recent years as a way to shape state law, avoiding Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto.

Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, introduces a bill barring public entities from funding 'obscene performances' on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that left the Senate with near-universal support picked up a “barnacle in committee,” as one House Democrat put it last week, leaving the House on a 71-20 vote Monday.
The House additions widen the scope of the underlying bill beyond an effort to replace a criminal term throughout Indiana code to include a focus on obscene performances. 
As originally written, Senate Bill 326 would have replaced “child pornography” with “child sex abuse material,” acknowledging that children are being sexually abused in such images. But a House committee added a new provision: barring government entities from using public money to fund, organize or host “obscene performances.” 
‘Obscene performance’ ban added to child abuse bill, official misconduct expungements weighed

A House floor amendment, which moved largely along party lines, also added a method of enforcement by allowing people to sue Indiana entities for alleged incidents. 
“Language shapes the way we understand and confront these issues and the term child pornography is not only inaccurate, it minimizes the horror of the crimes committed. Pornography implies a level of consent and children cannot consent,” said House sponsor Rep. Andrew Ireland. “… we’re taking an important step to save our Hoosier children.” 
The Indianapolis Republican said the language regarding obscene performances would ensure “that public funds are never used to support the exploitation of children.”
Defining something as obscene has to meet a high bar, known as the “Miller Test.” That work must be based on an average person’s reaction and consider the entire work, not just an isolated portion. 
But critics maintained that such performances aren’t happening, noting there are already penalties regardless of someone’s government affiliation. 
“More and more this General Assembly is taking itself to an alternate reality where it legislates against problems that don’t exist,” said Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. “We create a strawman and then we knock it down and ‘Look at us! We really solved that problem!’
“The problem never existed. But it appeals to somebody out there, so we do it now.” 
 Further discussion

Ireland didn’t cite specific instances of obscene performances using taxpayer dollars on Monday nor in his testimony last week when he introduced the penalty language. 
It also doesn’t limit such legal action to only Indiana residents, meaning that, according to Pierce, “any person in the universe can sue your local government when they’re offended by somebody and try to make an argument that it’s obscene.”
Pierce was one of the committee members to advance the bill, noting the high bar to meet the state’s obscenity standard, which he dubbed a “barnacle” on the House floor last week. In addition to the Miller test, a litigant would generally need to prove they have been harmed by obscene performances — a barrier meant to tamp down on frivolous lawsuits. 
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks on a bill on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But Pierce said the language eviscerates that and says “we don’t care if they’re harmed or not. We don’t care if they have a direct injury.”
Municipalities may still need to spend their dollars defending themselves from such accusations, which could include plays, poetry and drag shows. 
“Keep in mind, anybody involved in this supposed obscene performance that local government might be funding can already be arrested and imprisoned under our current (law),” Pierce continued. “I would think the fear of going to prison would keep local officials from going into the smut-peddling business.”
Ireland agreed with Pierce that such obscene performances “have never occurred and I hope never occur … in part, thanks to this bill.”
“This is nothing new under the sun,” concluded Ireland. 
The final vote tally split both parties, though only Ireland and Pierce spoke on the measure. It now goes to the Senate, which must vote to accept or reject the House amendments before the bill can advance.

(Courtesy image)OKLAHOMA CITY — The construction of a new inpatient mental health hospital is $124 million over budget, and House budget leaders do not want taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
The Donahue Behavioral Health Campus, located in Oklahoma City, was budgeted for $147 million and broke ground in March 2024. It would serve adults and adolescents with 330 beds when completed, an increase in capacity by 100 beds from the Griffin Memorial Hospital, in Norman, it is intended to replace. 
But in its budget request to the Legislature for the 2026 fiscal year, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services asked for another $124 million to cover overrun costs. The House recommended not fulfilling this request. 
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, chair of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee, said House leaders believe the Donahue project is too costly and a cheaper alternative must be found. 
“The House position is we want to do something transformational when it comes to shortening that waitlist, especially when it comes to mental health issues,” he said. “The Donahue build-out, as it stands right now, not only has come in over budget, but also had hiccups along the lines of, they forgot to put bathrooms in. … There’s a facility out there that I think we can purchase for about 15% of what it would cost to build the Donahue, and we want to get that done.”
He said there’s no “firm commitment” from the governor, the Senate or the Mental Health Department on this recommendation, but the House is working to see this plan come to fruition. 
In December, Oklahoma Watch reported the budget shortfall and that the opening of the hospital could potentially be pushed to 2028, rather than the scheduled 2026 date, due to unexpected costs, changes in the layout and number of bathrooms, and inflation. 
Kelsey Davis, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said there are no updates from the agency on their next steps or the reason for the cost overrun. 
The agency is actively working through what the future of the project will look like if the Legislature opts not to provide the extra funding, she said. 
Lawmakers committed $87 million in pandemic relief funds to the project. Oklahoma City leaders and county commissioners also contributed funding, with additional dollars expected to come from the sale of the Griffin Memorial Hospital land.

But an amendment approved Monday by the House Judiciary Committee seeks to compromise by “streamlining the process” for courts to quickly seal some records — meaning renters would not have to file anything on their own.
That includes eviction cases in which a judge sides with a tenant, or when a judgment against the tenant is later reversed.
A state law passed in 2022 already opened the door for some eviction matters to be sealed, but it’s currently up to tenants to file for expungement.
Statehouse testimony on the latest bill draft was positive. The measure passed 10-1 — only Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, voted in opposition — and now heads to the full House.
“The idea is, let’s get those (evictions) expunged, because, as you know, that’s like a black mark, and it makes it difficult for (tenants) to find housing,” said bill author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne. “The idea is now, with this amended bill, (tenants) are going to have skin in the game. If they really want that to be expunged, they’re going to have to go in and do that. But so many of these eviction proceedings have been resolved, and both sides on the claim are happy, and there was just no way for them to clear the name, and I think this is a good start.”
Changes to the bill
When first introduced, Brown’s bill would have required courts to automatically seal an eviction from a tenant’s record, as long as they have settled their debt, or the court ruled in their favor. Cases would qualify, too, if the eviction was dismissed by, overturned or vacated on appeal.
The original bill also sought to automatically seal all eviction cases after seven years.
The seven-year seal was removed by a Senate committee, however. Later, in the full chamber, a separate amendment further watered down the automatic sealing — shifting the burden back to renters to file expungement paperwork with their local court, which is how the process currently works.
Amendment author Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said he didn’t want to overburden the courts and additionally wants tenants to be held accountable for evictions.
Monday’s House committee amendment specifies that a court, “on its own motion,” can expunge eviction records as long as one of the following applies to the case:

the eviction action is dismissed by the court
a judgment in favor of the tenant is entered by the court
a judgment is entered by the court against the tenant, and the judgment is subsequently overturned or vacated on appeal

While not automatic, renters would further be able to seek expungement seven years after the conclusion of a case in which there was no money owed to the landlord.
There’s no waiting period, though, for tenants who have “satisfied” — paid back — a money judgment related to the eviction.
 Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Committee chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said courts typically don’t take action in a case until “somebody files a motion asking them to do something.” 
“I think there was a little concern about tasking the courts with sort of keeping track of where these evictions are at,” Jeter said. Evictions filed before 2021, for example, do not have case numbers to distinguish them from other small claims cases.
“I think one of the landing grounds we kind of came on is if it’s an order at the time when the judge (decides in favor of) the tenant, then they can seal (the eviction record) at that exact same time,” he continued. “But if it’s after, I think the thought is that we at least have the tenant take the proactive step of filing at least a one-page motion, or something, so the court can act.”
She emphasized that tenant-landlord bill are typically “difficult” and tough to pass out of legislative committees.
“The idea is there are good landlords, and there are good tenants. And frankly, when there is an eviction proceeding — whether it’s a judgment, or a question of security deposits or damages in the resolve — it’s not really the landlord’s responsibility anymore. Their claim has been resolved, and they’re fine. I don’t think they necessarily want that tenant to have that black mark on them … but that’s the case right now,” Brown said.
“This will make it seamless for the tenant,” she added. “They’re already in court — it will make it automatic. … And there’s no reason, if the landlord has not pursued the judgment in seven years, why that, on the motion of the tenant, can’t also get expunged.”
Housing advocates supportive
Housing advocates were supportive of the amended bill and maintained that eviction sealing is “very important” for tenants because landlords won’t be able to see past eviction cases when screening potential tenants. 
“Community stakeholders who are trying to create a new supply of housing and connect it with Hoosiers too often find that many Hoosiers don’t qualify for housing because they have that ‘Scarlet E’ of an eviction filing on their record,” said Andrew Bradley, with Prosperity Indiana. He pointed to data showing that 71,000 evictions were filed in the state over the last year.
“That’s a significant number of Hoosiers who now can qualify for safe, decent, affordable housing,” he said.

Brown crafted the legislation with input from students at the University of Notre Dame’s Eviction Clinic, which helps Hoosiers clear an eviction off their record for free.
David Pruitt, director of the university’s Clinical Law Center, said a majority of the eviction clinic’s cases stem from just “one incident” in a renter’s life. 
“There’s a medical bill, or a loss of a job, or something comes up, and the margins are so thin for people that they get knocked off track, and it’s hard for them to come up,” Pruitt said. “There are going to be some people that, honestly, are over their skis and they just found a place that’s just too expensive — and those are tough cases. And then you’ve got mixes of landlords being problematic, tenants being problematic. … But I would say that for significantly more than half of the individuals, it’s a razor’s edge.”
Indiana Legal Services, the largest provider of free civil legal aid to low-income Hoosiers, additionally worked on more than 1,600 eviction sealing cases last year.
“That’s a testament for the need for eviction sealing and the assistance that folks currently need to kind of get through the system,” said Jennifer Terry, an attorney with the nonprofit law firm. “We do see this bill as a good next step in streamlining some of those processes.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Madison School Board member Ali Muldrow said people who work in education know that the “worst day” is when children get hurt in school. 
“When the Abundant Life shooting happened, which was at a private Christian School very close to my home, it was just a really horrible day, and I think I realized it’s too late to talk about this,” Muldrow said. “It’s been too late and we can’t keep letting it be too late.”
A teacher and student were killed and six others were injured by a 15-year-old who brought a gun to Abundant Life Christian School, a private school in Madison, in December 2024. It is the deadliest school shooting on record in Wisconsin.
The shooting made national headlines, but it is just one example of children harmed by gun violence. According to the K-12 School Shooting Database, there were 332 school shootings in 2024. A 2024 report by Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found firearms continue to be a leading cause of death for children and teens, and those who are Black are disproportionately the victims
Muldrow, who is running unopposed for another term on the Board this spring, said measures taken to try to prevent shooting deaths at school have not been enough. 
“All of the things that we’ve done to our students haven’t resolved this issue — whether it’s practicing and having drills or whether it’s making our schools harder places to get into,” Muldrow said. “None of that changes the reality that a 15-year-old went into their school, two guns, and killed multiple people, including themselves.”
Students from Madison Metropolitan School District walked out of class in December and marched to the state Capitol to demand something be done about gun violence. 
“They asked for two things,” Muldrow said. “They asked for laws related to gun storage and gun safety, and they asked for more mental health support within their education.”  
Muldrow said that adults should “honor” the demands of the students and build bridges across political divides to get the work done. She said having conversations is an important starting point. 
In the aftermath of the Madison school shooting, Muldrow said she wanted to organize an event to inspire people in the community to feel capable of making change. She turned to a group that tried to find solutions after a school shooting took place about two years ago and more than 620 miles away.
Tennesseans were left reeling in 2023 after a shooter killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at the private Christian Covenant elementary school. A nonprofit organization called Builders (formerly known as Starts With Us) that seeks to ease political polarization brought together a group of 11 Tennessee residents with a range of opinions on the issue of guns to discuss and come up with some solutions. 
Muldrow was part of a similar group in Wisconsin in 2024 that explored the debate on abortion. She saw a documentary about the Tennessee group and thought its approach could be a way for the community affected by the Abundant Life shooting to come together and find a way forward. 
Muldrow said that the point of the event she helped organize Sunday was not necessarily to “mirror or mimic what happened in Tennessee, but to learn from that collaborative attitude towards solutions.” 
More than 100 people attended the event at the Overture Center for the Arts in Madison, which included a screening of the documentary about the Tennesseeans’ journey and a panel discussion with two of the participants and a handful of Wisconsinites.

Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll noted during the panel that potential solutions to gun violence would look different for Wisconsin, given the difference in state laws and the general beliefs of residents in each state. A key point of disagreement among participants in the documentary centered on concealed carry permits and whether they should be mandated. Tennessee has allowed for permitless carry of handguns since 2021.
Wisconsin already requires a permit for concealed carry, however, and it’s mostly not a partisan debate, Franklin said. According to the most recent polling, about 65% of Wisconsinites support concealed carry, but only under certain circumstances. 
“We do have a concealed carry law that requires a permit. When the Legislature has considered concealed carry without a permit, we found only about 20% support for that, about 80% opposition,” Franklin said. “There is a distinction that the public makes… public opinion is quite opposed to that form of concealed carry, but solidly in favor of [concealed carry] with a permit.”
Franklin said he thought proposals that originate from and garner support among Second Amendment supporters should be celebrated. He noted that there is a Republican bill that’s been introduced in Wisconsin that would create a tax exemption for gun safes. 
“That’s a small, incremental matter of, what, 5 ½% on the cost of the safe, but on the other hand, when you think of children’s access to guns in the home, access to those guns by burglars or other circumstances,” it could be a significant step, Franklin said. 
Franklin said the idea that “if you don’t get everything you’ve got nothing” is a huge barrier to progress. 
“I would just stress that incremental improvements are still improvements,” Franklin said.
Steve D’Orazio, founder and president of the Oregon, Wis., gun shop and range Max Creek Outdoors said during the panel that his business works hard to educate people who acquire guns. He said he has been working with a doctor at the UW Health System to educate doctors on guns and have them talk with their patients about gun safety and awareness, including keeping guns locked away. 
“My goal is the safety of our children,” D’Orazio said. 
The solution to school shootings he emphasized the most was implementing metal detectors in all schools. 
“Every one of us here today walked through the front door of this building and we walked through a metal detector, but our schools don’t have metal detectors,” D’Orazio said. “I sell guns. That’s our business. There’s so much education that we do at our shop to make sure that the gun owner doesn’t get hurt and that they use it correctly…, but every school district should have a metal detector. That’s how you’re going to stop this stuff.” 
The documentary shows the Tennessee group taking and presenting their recommendations at the Tennessee State Capitol. Those recommendations included temporary removal of firearms based on risk of violence, developing tools to support responsible gun ownership, expanding the role of school resource officers, investing in community to reduce trauma and developing gun literacy resources for schools, communities and media. 
Tennessee leaders did pass a bill in 2024 requiring education in schools about guns, a policy similar to the recommendation of the group. Though the end result was not exactly as participants imagined it. 
Adam Luke, a Tennessee marriage and family counselor and conservative, spoke to how the “rush to be right” by lawmakers on the issue may diminish the effectiveness of the legislation.  
“People will not be able to opt out [of the curriculum]. Now, I would like to turn to conservative America and say, ‘If you did not have the ability to opt your child out of sex education would that bother you?’” Luke asked. “This is what happens when you have super majorities.” 
Luke said that the Tennessee Department of Education also doesn’t have the curriculum for teachers and just recently closed the public response period. He said lawmakers were so quick to want to get something done that they’ve created a policy that may not be effective.
“Let’s say that we did something, but guess what? We forgot to actually give you the resources to be successful with it,” Luke said. 
Political polarization was on display following the Madison school shooting. Muldrow said she has been “saddened” by the divide.
“It’s really hard to see our Legislature be so divided and in such a contentious relationship with our governor, and it’s a shame because all of these people represent us and there is an expectation that they work together,” Muldrow said. 
  “When the Abundant Life shooting happened, which was at a private Christian School very close to my home, it was just a really horrible day, and I think I realized it’s too late to talk about this,” Madison School Board member Ali Muldrow said. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.
Since the shooting, Gov. Tony Evers has launched the Office of Violence Prevention and has proposed adopting further gun safety policies including stricter background checks and red flag laws. Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize Evers’ proposals and have been developing their own proposals for addressing school shootings, including financial support for the Office of School Safety and allowing teachers to be armed. 
The Madison Common Council and the Dane County Board of Supervisors both passed resolutions urging the Legislature to take action and implement common-sense gun measures. 
Steven Olikara, a former candidate for Wisconsin Senate and founder of the nonpartisan organization the Future Caucus, said the actions of local leaders and Evers are a step forward, but the state needs to take bigger steps. 
“Those bigger steps will come from bringing Democrats and Republicans together in a real way and building trust,” Olikara said. “And I think conversations like this can help create that kind of momentum. [When people are at] each other’s throats, the kind of progress you make is very small and very incremental. When you have conversations like the one today, you can reach transformative change, and that’s really what we need.”
Tennessee educator Alyssa Pearman, who lost one of her students to gun violence, said the key is to keep showing up to have the conversations.
“You are going to be told no, and you are going to have people who have no interest in making a change and being a builder, but you keep showing up,” Pearman said. “You find people who want to do something, who want a better tomorrow, and you have conversations like these… This is the type of conversation that needs to be had, whether it’s in Wisconsin, whether it’s in Tennessee and whatever state where we have this crisis.”

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.












We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis




Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

Bausch was a German immigrant who had moved to Billings a few years earlier and started farming just outside of town. He was [&#8230;]","A montage created by the Montana Historical Society of people arrested and convicted of seditious speech during the World War I era. This photo is by no means exhaustive. Seventy-two Montanans were charged, tried and convicted for running afoul of the Montana Sedition Act. Early on the morning of April 13, 1918, a group of Billings residents surrounded the house of Herman Bausch, which happens to be right across the street from where I live now. Bausch was a German immigrant who had moved to Billings a few years earlier and started farming just outside of town. He was highly respected in Billings for being a bit of an innovator, one of the first locals to plant an orchard. 
But that morning, he was confronted by a mob because he had been included on a list of Billings residents that had not purchased Liberty bonds to help support America’s entry into World War I. Bausch had stated: “I am opposed to war…all war that is aggressive and oppressive. But if Wall Street plutocrats insist on further bloodshed, let them finance it. Voluntarily, I will not contribute financially to this world calamity.”
The mob pressed Bausch to change his mind and buy some Liberty bonds, and when he refused, they threatened to string him up in one of the apple trees in his yard. But instead they dragged him off to the local Elks Club, where a group of more than 50 people had gathered. This crowd spent several hours grilling Bausch, trying again to convince him to buy bonds, but he would not budge. So he was charged under the Montana Sedition Act, and sentenced to four years in prison. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said that patriotism means standing with one’s country, not standing with the president. But America has a checkered past when it comes to using patriotism as a cudgel to keep people from expressing themselves, and one of the most egregious examples of that started right here in Montana. 
When war broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were almost universally opposed to becoming involved in the conflict. The overall sentiment was that the conflict was none of our business, but there was also a general feeling that it wouldn’t last long. But as the war dragged on, the allies—which included Great Britain, France, Russia, and China—pressed President Woodrow Wilson to change his mind. The longer it lasted, the more concerned they were about having the resources necessary to fight off the Axis, which consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. 
Two major events played a huge role in swaying public sentiment. First, German U-boats sank the Lusitania, a British ocean liner, in 1915. The incident killed 1198 people, and 128 of them were American. 
The second event was the revelation in January 1917 that German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman had carried out a secret diplomatic correspondence with the German Ambassador to Mexico, proposing that if Mexico joined forces with the Germans, Germany would help them regain control of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. 
Although Wilson won reelection in 1916 on a platform of keeping Americans out of the war, it was just a few months after his inauguration that he declared war on Germany, and it was as if a switch had been flipped. A country that had been so firmly neutral suddenly developed a rabid form of nationalism.
Wilson established the Committee on Public Information, which distributed books and pamphlets, sent out speakers, and even made films, spreading strong opinions about German immigrants, and calling on everyone to buy Liberty bonds to support the war effort. In Montana, Gov. Sam Stewart got so caught up in this nationalist fervor that he called a special session of the Legislature just a few weeks after Wilson declared war, and convinced them to pass The Montana Sedition Act, which was an expansion of a previous bill called the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act was designed to pressure anyone who published works that undermined the war effort, but the Sedition Act took that sentiment one step further, encouraging local law enforcement to seek out people who simply spoke out against the war, or failed to show their support. During the next two years, 78 Montanans were convicted under the Sedition Act, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years. These people were not activists or troublemakers. They were farmers and salesman, and even housewives. 
One man, rancher Faye Rumsey, was sentenced to 20  years after a mob confronted him for not buying Liberty bonds, insisting that he kiss the American flag to show his loyalty. Another was convicted after saying that he wished the Kaiser would come over and straighten things out in his own county. 
Once the war ended, people came to their senses, and the Montana Sedition Act was repealed in 1921. The people serving sentences were released. But not before Herman Bausch lost his 2-year-old son and wasn’t allowed to travel from Deer Lodge to Billings for the funeral. And not before Faye Rumsey’s wife lost their ranch and had to give up all 12 of their children to the state. Many of these siblings never saw each other again. 
In 2006, Gov. Brian Schweitzer issued a pardon to everyone who had been convicted under the Sedition Act, and it was at that ceremony that several of Faye Rumsey’s grandchildren met for the first time. 
Herman Bausch was able to return to the house across the street from where I live and continue to farm, having more children. But extreme nationalism left its mark on his life, as it did on many innocent Montanans.

The proposed legislation (HB910/SB861) by Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon and Rep. Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville, both Republicans, would transfer the nonpartisan commission’s responsibilities to the Office of the Attorney General in a newly-created Civil Rights Enforcement Division.
Democrats on the panel questioned the need to dismantle the 60-year-old, independent commission responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodations – including investigations into claims of discrimination made against the state of Tennessee — and shift its responsibilities to Jonathan Skrmetti, who, as attorney general, has aggressively used the power of his office to champion conservative causes.

“I do have a concern with this attorney general making political decisions rather than legal decisions and — to the extent that threatens the civil rights of the citizens of Tennessee — I think we need to take a very very careful look at that,” said Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat.
Garrett said the Human Rights Commission was currently doing a “fine job” but giving the power of civil rights enforcement to the attorney general may serve as a greater deterrent to those accused of discrimination.
“I think if someone receives a letter or an action that the attorney general is investigating their actions, I think that’s going to perk up some people,” he said.
The proposed legislation alters the scope of discrimination claims that may be pursued against educational institutions.
The bill creates a pathway for those denied admission to schools on the basis of “race, color or national origin” — or participation in clubs or activities — to file complaints with the Attorney General, a provision widely understood to give white students a basis to file claims against educational institutions that have diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
But in response to a question from Rep. G.A. Hardaway about whether the genesis of the proposed law is “somehow related to reverse discrimination,” Garrett responded that he “did not know how to respond” to the question.
The bill also excludes disability and religion from the list of discriminatory activities in educational institutions that the attorney general would be required to investigate. Garrett noted that there remain federal avenues for pursuing those claims.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

The bill would eliminate the Human Rights Commission by July 1, transferring 30 of its employees to the offices of the attorney general, who would then have the option to utilize employees at his discretion.
About 1,000 pending discrimination complaints before the commission would be dismissed, forcing the individuals who brought them – and the employers and institutions who have spent time and money defending themselves — to start anew, Muriel Malone Nolen, the commission’s executive director testified last week.
Individuals who have filed complaints would have the option of restarting their complaint within 90 days of the law taking effect, but Nolen noted that some of those actions may then fall out of a 180-day statute of limitations and no longer be viable.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)About a hundred people gathered in Springdale Monday in support of immigrant workers, a group that rallygoers said have been the target of recent policies at the state and federal levels. 
The event was organized by Venceremos, a worker-based organization with a mission to ensure the human rights of poultry workers. The organization, whose name is Spanish for “we will overcome,” is led by executive director Magaly Licolli, who told the Advocate Friday that immigrants who were honored as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are now being demonized. 
“Five years ago these workers were called essential workers, heroes, that without their jobs we wouldn’t have food on the table, and now they are being attacked and being called criminals,” Licolli said. 
President Donald Trump promised mass deportations on the campaign trail, and has followed through by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, supporting high-profile raids and revoking an extension of Temporary Protected Status for some immigrants, among other things. 
Trump’s policies have left immigrants living in fear as they’re being treated as “second-class citizens or no citizens at all,” Licolli said. 
While the national rhetoric started by targeting immigrants who were criminals, Licolli said the discussion has devolved into labeling all immigrants as criminals regardless of their immigration status. 
“We are seeing really that they are deporting anyone just because they are brown and being detained because they look brown until they prove they have the paperwork to stay in this country,” she said. “It is not fair that they are treating everybody as equal as criminals and without recognizing that criminals, murderers, all of these criminals can be [anyone] — it doesn’t matter the race.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders tied Arkansas immigration policy to Trump when she announced legislation two weeks ago to impose harsher penalties on undocumented migrants who commit crimes in the state. 
“The Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act makes it clear: Arkansas will not tolerate violent, criminal illegals and will do our part to help the Trump administration keep our citizens safe,” Sanders said during a March 17 press conference. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 426 Monday morning, but an amendment in the afternoon means the bill will need to be reheard by the committee.
Licolli told reporters Monday that when Sanders says it’s her job to protect citizens, she’s only referring to the white community. 
“We are also citizens, we are also humans,” Licolli said. “And she’s been enjoying the chicken that these immigrants are producing, so I wonder what she’s going to do with her chicken if they are targeting the immigrants. She enjoys the benefits from the labor of these immigrants, so it’s a hypocrisy and it’s very racist that she is condemning all of these people for feeding her family.”
Springdale is home to Tyson Foods, one the world’s largest food companies, and Licolli said poultry companies, like Tyson, should speak out for immigrants because they benefit from their labor. In addition to calling for better working conditions and for immigrants’ humanity to be respected, Licolli said they also deserve a path to citizenship for all they’ve done to support the economy. 
Protestors urge Arkansas’ Tyson to commit to child labor, worker safety protections

Vladimir Rivera Lopez, District 4 Justice of the Peace for the Washington County Quorum Court, said he became really interested in workers rights after reading Life and Death of the American Worker, a book by Alice Driver that shares the challenges faced by immigrant workers at Tyson.
Rivera Lopez, a Springdale Democrat that won his first-ever election by 10 votes in November, said that he will attend “any event that affirms the dignity of someone else in my community.”
“It’s very easy to exploit people who can’t vote, who don’t have that opportunity to represent themselves come November, but that doesn’t mean that these people don’t exist,” he said.
Rivera Lopez joined dozens of Northwest Arkansas residents at Monday’s rally, including Angela Hickman of Bella Vista, who decided to spend her day off marching to city hall dressed as Lady Liberty alongside her boyfriend and dog. 
Hickman said she’s taking every opportunity “to show support and fight back” because there’s a lot wrong with what’s happening in the country. 
“Letting our people that represent us know that we are not okay with what’s going on,” she said. “And Trump and [Elon] Musk need to not be where they are. They’re doing a lot of damage, and I can’t just sit idly by.”
Even when policies don’t directly affect her, Hickman, who teared up during her explanation, said that one day “it could be me.”
“I have children, they need a future, and I have to make that happen for them,” she said. “My grandmother did it, my mom did it, my aunt, it’s in the family all the way back to the Civil Rights Movement and everything in between. My grandmother can’t be here to do it, she is no longer with us, so I’m doing it for her.”

As a part of the collaboration, St. Luke’s emergency departments in Boise, Meridian, Mountain Home and McCall have more than 20 Naloxone distribution containers, or “barney boxes,” stocked with free overdose prevention supplies in their lobby entrance areas. 
The boxes contain free naloxone kits and are paid for with opioid settlement funds. The boxes can help save lives. Naloxone (Narcan) is a safe, effective, over-the-counter medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. 
“Naloxone is designed to be easy for anyone to administer, even without medical training,” Courtney Boyce, the health district’s substance use and behavioral health program manager, said in a press release. “The nasal spray is very straightforward to use. Instructions are included on the naloxone box.”
Training is also available upon request, Boyce said. 
Ten boxes were placed in 2024, another 10 this year. Central District Health is aiming for 10 more in 2026, according to the press release. Participating agencies that house the boxes may choose to stock xylazine testing strips, fentanyl testing strips, rescue breath shields and other free items. 
Those interested in ordering a naloxone distribution box or interested in exploring other overdose prevention and rescue supplies provided by the health district can visit the district’s storefront. Supplies come with free shipping for Ada, Boise, Elmore, or Valley counties. Barney Box locations can be found here.

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee lawmakers are headed for a showdown over hemp legislation that, under a Senate version, could heavily restrict products containing intoxicating derivatives.
Both measures are to be considered Tuesday in House and Senate finance committees and could impact a regulated industry that nets the state tens of millions in revenue from an estimated $280 million to $560 million in yearly sales.
The biggest difference in the bills lies with THCA, a derivative that delivers a high similar to marijuana once it is heated or burned. The House version would allow THCA to continue to be sold in some stores while the Senate bill would restrict it.
Clint Palmer, a hemp industry attorney, said Tennessee could become the first state in the nation to regulate the THCA market, a move generally supported by the industry because it would enable sales to continue. 
Both versions of the bill would move the policing of hemp-derived products under the Alcoholic Beverage Commission from the Department of Agriculture and enact a wholesale tax of one cent per milligram on hemp products.
Originally, both versions would have prohibited THCA, but an amendment placed on the House bill was designed to keep hemp farmers from losing their businesses. 
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

House Majority Leader William Lamberth, sponsor of the House version, confirmed Monday the biggest sticking point between the two versions is the level of delta-9 THC that would be allowed in products.
Hemp is distinguished from marijuana based on the concentration of a compound called delta-9 THC. Cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC is defined as legal hemp in Tennessee as well as federally. Cannabis with greater concentrations is classified as marijuana and is illegal to grow, sell or possess in the state.
Sen. Richard Briggs, sponsor of the Senate version, amended the bill late last week, to ensure the measure wouldn’t hurt the state financially. It’s expected to maintain a surplus of up to $14 million from fees and taxes on growers, wholesalers and sellers, he said.
Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, said the bill would ban marijuana but not hemp. He bases his view on a 2024 letter from the U.S. Department of Justice stating the Controlled Substances Act classifies THCA as “controlled.” Yet the act excludes hemp from the definition of marijuana as long as it has a THC concentration of no more than 0.3%.
“We’re not interested in recreational marijuana,” Briggs said.
If both measures move through their respective chambers unchanged, the bills could be resolved with a conference committee to work out differences as the legislature adjourns for the year.
The matter remains tied up in litigation after the state required new testing of hemp products last year for delta-9 THC. The Tennessee Growers Coalition and the Tennessee Healthy Alternatives Associations said rules set to take effect in late December 2024 amounted to state “overreach” that would lead to a ban on products.
Dispute also centers on a move by the liquor store industry to take over most of THC drink sales from convenience and grocery stores.
Those stores are trying to stay in business as the law allows, said Rob Ikard of the Tennessee Grocers and Convenience Store Association.
“Grocery stores and convenience stores who are already in this business under the current law do a really good job of age enforcement and regulation,” Ikard said.
Briggs said Monday he believes too many products on store shelves contain higher THC levels than the law allows. He believes the Alcoholic Beverage Commission should get involved in regulating the industry, and he added that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation could play a role in enforcement.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Bishops from the Catholic dioceses of Bismarck and Fargo signed a joint letter Sunday urging parishioners across the state to contact their legislators and advocate for Education Savings Accounts.
Senate Bill 2400 and House Bill 1540 both passed their respective chambers during the first half of the legislative session and would allocate state tax dollars to student Education Savings Accounts that could be spent on a variety of services, including paying tuition for private schools.
The letter, signed by Bishop David Kagan of Bismarck and Bishop John Folda of Fargo, states the church teaches that parents are the primary educators for their children and they should have the freedom and resources to choose the best educational setting for their kids.
“They do not divert money from public schools, do not hurt rural schools and would be a great help to many families across the state of North Dakota,” the letter stated.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

The letter was read from the pulpit at Catholic churches across the state, said David Tamisiea, executive director of the North Dakota Catholic Conference. 
“It should’ve been read by everybody,” Tamisiea said.
He said it is the job of bishops as teachers of the faith to educate the faithful.
“People of faith have a voice to be heard in the public sphere,” Tamisiea said. “It’s OK for our faith leaders to encourage the people to exercise that voice and that’s what they are doing.”
He also said public-private partnerships are a staple of state government in North Dakota and the education system should not be any different.
“There are all kinds of public-private partnerships where we use public funds to pay private organizations to carry out important tasks,” Tamisiea said.
The Catholic dioceses of Fargo and Bismarck encompass about 220 churches across North Dakota, according to their websites. The state also has more than 35 private Catholic schools, including pre-K.
Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, which represents public school educators and opposes the bills, said the call to action by the Catholic diocese was not unexpected.
“What we are preparing for is to defeat these bills in each of the two chambers,” Archuleta said. “We’ve never been a fan of using public dollars to support private school tuition and we’re not going to start now.”
He added North Dakota United conducted polling in December that showed 68% of respondents were somewhat or strongly opposed to using tax dollars to pay for private tuition.
Both bills are scheduled for committee work on Tuesday in the Senate and House Education Committees, which are expected to make recommendations in the coming days.

In its first abortion case since President Donald Trump’s reelection, the Supreme Court will hear arguments next week about whether states can bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds — which could further the administration’s goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.
Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic concerns an order from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who in 2018 said any clinic that provided abortions could not participate in the state’s Medicaid program. Lower courts have blocked McMaster’s order from taking effect. But if implemented, the state policy could seriously undercut South Carolinians’ access to reproductive health care and create a template for other states to emulate.
Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans disproportionately serves Black and Latinx people. It does not cover abortions in most states, including in South Carolina, where just under 60% of beneficiaries are not White. Federal law dictates that people who receive Medicaid — more than a million in South Carolina, and about 400,000 of whom are women between the ages of 15 and 44 — are allowed to use it at any qualified health care provider that accepts the insurance plan.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Cutting Planned Parenthood from Medicaid could have big impacts: Planned Parenthood clinics provide other forms of medical care, such as testing for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings and birth control services, all of which Medicaid is supposed to cover. Medicaid is the most common source of insurance for patients who seek health care at Planned Parenthood clinics. Without Medicaid reimbursement, the clinics — which operate with thin financial margins — would likely either have to turn patients away or charge them.
The oral arguments — in which the federal government has joined the case as a friend of the court to argue alongside the state in defense of the policy — in this case come at a complex moment for the future of reproductive health care more broadly. Backed by anti-abortion activists, Trump has pushed an agenda of ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of which comes from Medicaid.
Abortion opponents have called this policy “defunding,” even though it would not affect private money given to Planned Parenthood, and it would cut revenue sources that don’t actually pay for abortion. Still, it could inject new financial instability for Planned Parenthood and other similar health centers.
A report this week from The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Trump administration is considering freezing all funding to Title X, another federal program that supports family planning clinics services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood is the largest single Title X provider.
With the exception of medical emergencies, health facilities aren’t required to accept Medicaid, meaning that people covered through the program can struggle to find health care providers who take their insurance.
Research from George Washington University suggests that almost 40% of all counties in South Carolina are “contraceptive deserts” where there aren’t enough providers to serve all people in need.
But the impact would likely extend even beyond areas where reproductive health care is hard to attain, denying people in all parts of the country the right to choose who provides an intimate, essential form of health care, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor emerita of health law and policy at George Washington University who co-authored a brief arguing that the Supreme Court should reject South Carolina’s policy.
“I don’t care if you’re in rural South Carolina or downtown St. Louis, Missouri. There are certain services where if it’s a good quality provider, and this is the provider you prefer, it’s very important to be able to see a trusted provider,” she said.
Public health professionals have warned that upholding South Carolina’s policy could open the door to states discriminating against other qualified medical providers, deciding arbitrarily that patients cannot use their Medicaid coverage at certain health clinics. That could include refusing to let Medicaid cover a certain home care provider because of its stance on unionization, Rosenbaum suggested, or because of employees participating in protests.
And it could influence other states with anti-abortion government leaders. Already, three other states — Arkansas, Missouri and Texas — are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid, even though abortion is illegal in two of those.
“If the Supreme Court decides that Medicaid recipients cannot fight back in court when the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services prevents them from freely choosing their health care provider, the effects could ripple far beyond South Carolina,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights but whose research is cited across the political spectrum.
A 2015 analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating all federal funding for Planned Parenthood would mean fewer Americans receiving family planning care — and more people having unplanned pregnancies — even if other health care providers tried to step in. The government analysis, conducted before the overturning of Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban abortion, found that eliminating federal funding would increase federal spending by $130 million over nine years.
“If you pull back Medicaid funding… then they become nonviable, which is the whole point,” Rosenbaum said. “The public health effects of all this are horrendous.”

AARP West Virginia backs this bill, estimating that it could help 250,000 caregivers who are helping family members in the state. 
But as Crossover Day is Wednesday — the day legislation must move out of their chamber of origin — the tax credit bill sits parked in the Senate Finance Committee. 
“Family caregivers often face significant out-of-pocket expenses, averaging over $7,200 annually, to ensure their loved ones receive the necessary care,” said Gaylene Miller, AARP West Virginia state director. “A caregiver tax credit would provide significant financial relief to family caregivers, promoting independence and safety for loved ones, and encouraging more individuals to take on caregiving roles.”
The measure, Senate Bill 697, is known as the “Caregiver Tax Credit Act.” It would establish a nonrefundable tax credit with a maximum of $2,000 for eligible family members 18 years of age and older for eligible expenditures incurred in their caregiving duties.
A fiscal note by the state Tax and Revenue Department estimates that the proposed legislation would result in a loss of General Revenue funds of $160 million to $260 million per year beginning in fiscal year 2028.
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
“While this tax credit will cost the state initially, I believe the savings will more than be made up for it because Medicaid will not have to pay for nursing home residential care,” said Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, who sponsored the bill. “Beyond the savings, our elderly deserve to remain in their homes surrounded by their loved ones for as long as possible.”
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Representatives from AARP West Virginia say their research shows 84% of Republican, Democratic and independent voters support a tax credit for caregivers.  
“The caregiver tax credit bill is a righteous investment in keeping disabled or elderly West Virginians out of institutional care,” said Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, a co-sponsor of the measure. “This is the most ‘West Virginia’ bill I have seen in 11 sessions. We are our brothers’ keepers.”
The Senate Health Committee advanced the legislation March 19, sending the measure to the finance committee.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett was unavailable to comment for this story. 
U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has introduced a bill on the federal level — the Credit for Caring Act — aimed at providing financial relief for family caregivers. The bipartisan legislation would offer a tax credit of up to $5,000 for eligible working family caregivers to help offset caregiving expenses.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Among the powerful committee leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives, no one ships nearly as much campaign money to his party’s political caucus as Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie.
That’s a finding in a report released last week by the Washington-based political reform group Issue One. And, in the context of the report, it’s not a flattering distinction.
The report is the latest of five that Issue One has released since 2017 that decry a system — employed by both parties — in which House members find themselves under “relentless fundraising pressure” to raise money for their party caucus committee if they want to be appointed to powerful and prestigious committees.
“A little-known fact about members of Congress is that they must constantly raise money not just for their own reelection bids but to help their respective political parties accumulate power,” the report says. “Both the Democratic and Republican parties lean on their most powerful legislators to boost their political war chests, under something called the ‘party dues’ system.” 
This forces members to devote vast amounts of time to fundraising — time sometimes spent pleading for money from wealthy interests that lobby Congress and appear before congressional committees, the report says.
The pressure comes from the Republican and Democratic leaders who control committee assignments of their members.
Last December Republican leaders of the U.S. House picked Guthrie to chair the important Committee on Energy and Commerce, the oldest continuous standing committee in the House and one with broad jurisdiction over the country’s health care, energy and environmental policies, telecommunications and technology innovation, and consumer safety.
  Issue One examined the contributions of 11 top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful House committees to their party’s caucus’ political fund since Jan. 1, 2023. Rep. Brett Guthrie topped the list, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the period.

GOP leaders have handed Guthrie and his committee a big assignment: cut $880 billion in spending, much of which will have to come from Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for about 72 million Americans’ health care, including almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians. The savings are needed to reduce the federal budget by $2 trillion as Republicans seek to renew and make permanent $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from the first Trump administration. 
Issue One examined the contributions of top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful committees of the House since Jan. 1, 2023. The report found that about $1 of every $6 spent by the campaign committees of these 11 key committee leaders (seven Republicans, four Democrats) was in contributions to the party caucus’ political fund. (For Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or DCCC; for Republicans, the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC.)
Among the 11 committee leaders, the report shows Guthrie gave by far the most, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the NRCC during the period. That amounted to a bit more than half of all of the spending by Guthrie’s committee during the period. (None of the other 10 committee leaders whose campaign finances were examined transferred more than $1.5 million or more than 39% of their total spending during the period to their caucus political fund.)
  More than half of Guthrie’s campaign expenditures during the two-year period were to the National Republican Campaign Committee. (Source: Issue One from analysis of Federal Elections Commission data)
Guthrie’s Washington office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern last week to a Guthrie campaign spokeswoman who did not reply to an email from Kentucky Lantern.
Issue One reported that in his recent bid for chairmanship of Energy and Commerce, Guthrie was opposed by U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican. Online records of the Federal Election Commission show Latta’s campaign committee transferred nearly $1.3 million to the NRCC in 2023-24. That’s a large amount, but still far less than the $2.5 million transferred by Guthrie’s campaign committee during the same period.
“Fundraising prowess is one criteria that party leaders consider when deciding whom to elevate into important leadership roles … ,” said Michael Beckel, one of the authors of the Issue One report. “Rep. Guthrie’s massive fundraising for the NRCC ahead of the 2024 election certainly didn’t hurt him as he made a bid to become the next chairman of the coveted House Energy and Commerce Committee.”
Punchbowl News reported soon after last November’s elections that Guthrie appeared to be the favorite over Latta. While Latta had an advantage in experience, Punchbowl News reported Guthrie “leads the fundraising race this year by leaps and bounds.”
‘Profound conflicts of interest’

In 2016 USA Today reported that the process involves legislative leaders setting quotas for members. “Lawmakers are supposed to dip into their own reelection accounts to meet these fundraising quotas,” USA Today reported. “Those who make — or exceed — their dues are considered ‘team players,’ a label that lifts their chances of landing plum committee assignments.”
That same USA Today report said another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, refused to pay his dues. “They told us right off the bat as soon as we get here, ‘These committees all have prices and don’t pick an expensive one if you can’t make the payments,” Massie said. “That’s part of orientation.”
On Monday, Massie, in response to questions emailed him by Kentucky Lantern, said, “My opinion of the dues system is still the same: it’s extortion and should be illegal.”
As for how his refusal to participate in the system has affected his committee assignments, Massie said, “I’ve been able to maintain committee assignments to B and C committees without giving to the NRCC, but participation on an A committee is understood to be off the table, so I’ve never sought an A committee.”
Issue One CEO Nick Penniman said in last week’s report, “It’s a betrayal of public trust for legislative leaders in Congress to be constantly worried about fundraising and regularly soliciting wealthy and well-connected donors who have business before their committees. These fundraising demands lead to profound conflicts of interest.”
Guthrie, of Bowling Green, is a former state senator who first won election to Congress in 2008 by beating Democrat David Boswell in a competitive election for the right to succeed retiring Republican Congressman Ron Lewis.
Since then Guthrie has never been seriously threatened in eight reelections. This gives him the luxury of being able to transfer his campaign funds to the NRCC. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote despite transferring more than half of his campaign war chest during the two-year election cycle to the NRCC.
Beckel of Issue One described the organization as bipartisan and called it “the leading cross-partisan political reform group in Washington, D.C.”
“We unite Republicans, Democrats, and independents in the movement to fix our broken political system and build a democracy that works for everyone,” he said. “We are fiercely bipartisan, working with current and former members of Congress from both sides of the aisle.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2197247907-594x594-1.jpg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A former Democratic state lawmaker is no longer sitting on a powerful commission regulating utilities in Kentucky after the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate took no action to confirm him before the 2025 regular session ended Friday. 
  John Will Stacy
Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in September appointed John Will Stacy of West Liberty, a state representative from 1993 to 2015 who later served as the Morgan County judge-executive, to the three-member Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC). 
Stacy sat on the commission and heard requests from utilities in the months after his appointment but needed confirmation by the Kentucky Senate to continue serving through the end of his term in 2028. No resolution to confirm Stacy had been introduced, confirmation hearing scheduled or vote taken on his appointment by the time lawmakers adjourned Friday.  
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Mancester, told reporters Friday the reasons for not confirming Stacy included that the former lawmaker was drawing a pension from his previous time in government on top of a six-figure salary PSC commissioners make. 
Stivers also said he knew of Stacy’s business interests and local and government experience, but he considered Stacy to be unqualified for the role given the complexity of topics dealt with by the PSC.
“What is his background in energy?” Stivers said. “This is a highly technical field.”
The Republican Senate leader said he hoped Beshear would appoint a new PSC member who has experience in a range of utilities from electricity to drinking water given the technical nature of overseeing the “delivery of cheap, dispatchable energy to the consumer.” 
But the Senate is making it harder to recruit PSC candidates, Beshear spokesperson Crystal Staley told the Lantern on Monday.
“This is now the third Public Service Commissioner that the General Assembly has not confirmed. Each has been qualified, and the failure to confirm them has drastically reduced interest in the positions. The Senate continues to create new structures or take actions to pressure the commission on the outcome of or the reopening of cases.”
The PSC regulates the rates and services of more than 1,100 utilities, from large investor-owned electric providers such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities to small water districts providing drinking water to rural communities. 
The legislature last year created an 18-member commission, separate from the PSC, charged with examining and making recommendations on requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2023, the legislature passed a law making it harder for utilities to retire coal-fired power plants.
Stacy’s removal leaves two commissioners on the three-member board, PSC chair Angie Hatton and Mary Pat Regan. 
Stivers had introduced a bill in this year’s regular session to expand the membership of the PSC from three commissioners to five but ultimately tabled the legislation.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stivers031425-1024x750.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The push to clear the air inside Rhode Island’s two casinos won’t ignite at the shareholder level this year.
Enough Bally’s Corporation shareholders had backed a proposal to study a smoking ban from Michigan-based Trinity Health at the company’s 2024 annual meeting to qualify for resubmission at this year’s gathering tentatively scheduled for May 15. But Cathy Rowan, Trinity’s director of socially responsible investments, told Rhode Island Current that the nonprofit chose not to refile. 
She attributed the decision to last year’s buyout of Bally’s by the New York hedge fund owned by Soo Kim, the Providence-based casino giant’s largest shareholder and chairman of its Board of Directors.
Asked how the new structure would impact a new proposal to study a potential smoking ban, Rowan said it would “be difficult to achieve a vote result similar to what the resolution received last year.”
Trinity will still submit shareholder resolutions to go smoke-free with Boyd Gaming, Caesars Entertainment, Wynn Resorts and Penn Entertainment. 
Lauren Westerfield, a spokesperson for Bally’s corporate office, acknowledged a request for comment with an email saying that the company plans to release a proxy statement after April 4.
That leaves advocates’ ongoing battle to end the loophole that exempts the state’s two casinos from an indoor smoking ban solely with the General Assembly.
“We’ve always taken the position that this was going to take a legislative fix,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrick Crowley said in an interview. “And we’re trying to let as many legislators know where we stand.”
Crowley is also betting big that public opinion will make the difference. The AFL-CIO in February released a poll that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
And momentum appears to be growing in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, where legislation filed by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, has been co-sponsored by Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi.
“I’m glad our legislature seems to be moving in the right direction,” Tanzi said in an interview. “I do believe that this will in fact pass on the House side this year.” 
Matt Dunham, president of Providence-based Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, said support in the House was always going to be a given after Shekarchi allowed a symbolic committee vote at the end of last year’s legislative session.
“It’s always come down to the Senate,” he said. “They’ve always been the ones we couldn’t get.”
Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, was initially referred to the Senate Committee on Finance but has since been transferred to the chamber’s Committee on Labor and Gaming, which is chaired by Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who has been a staunch opponent against banning smoking.
Ciccone said in a recent interview that he met with union leaders and anti-smoking advocates on Feb. 26 to try and come up with a compromise to expand existing non-smoking areas in the casinos.
“We’re still working on it,” Ciccone said.
Crowley called the meeting “cordial.”
“And we agreed to continue talking and see where this goes over the next couple of weeks and months of the session,” Crowley said.
Ciccone said he understands advocates’ calls to end Bally’s exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban, but argued that allowing smoking gives Rhode Island’s casinos a competitive edge over neighboring states with more dining and shopping options.
“If you go to Lincoln, why are the majority of the cars in the parking lot from out of state?” he said. “Is it because they like us? Or do they come to us because they smoke?”
Ciccone said a smoking ban could cut Bally’s bottom line by upward of 10%, which would result in 126 layoffs in Lincoln and Tiverton — projections company spokesperson Patti Doyle said were accurate.
“We intend to present information about the revenue and jobs impact of a potential smoking ban at our two Rhode Island venues when we testify on legislation introduced to do just that,” Doyle said in an emailed statement.
Tanzi and Susnowski’s bills have yet to be scheduled for a hearing. Tanzi said she expects her bill to go before the House Committee on Finance after legislators wrap up their ongoing budget hearings.
Dunham said he doesn’t believe the company’s argument over job cuts is valid.
“They run a barebones operation already,” he said. “The problem I see in the casino is they don’t hire enough.”
Bally’s has 40 job postings for its Lincoln casino and 18 at its Tiverton location as of Monday, according to its website.
As state lawmakers prepare for debate to return to Smith Hill, Dunham said the union plans to hold rallies and encourage workers and advocates to write to their legislators.
“We’re going to do the same thing we’ve always been doing,” he said.

Local food purchasing programs are some of the latest government programs summarily guillotined by the administration. These programs, managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture via the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and the Local Food for Schools & Child Care Agreement Program, would have appropriated $13.1 million to provide local food to food banks, students and food insecure populations. By supporting Colorado farmers and ranchers, local food procurement programs also promised to strengthen regional food systems.
The local food purchasing programs were true win-win initiatives for Colorado’s consumers and producers. From Pueblo to the Western Slope, food banks, schools, day cares, churches and veteran service centers used USDA dollars to buy local produce, beef, dairy, grains and other agricultural products from Colorado farms, ranches, dairies and more. Between May 2022 and June 2024, 220 food producers earned $6.7 million from local food purchasing programs. More than a million dollars funneled into the pockets of Western Slope farmers.

For producers participating in the programs, the short-term outcomes were financial stability, new partnerships with large institutions, and the expansion of business operations. For the entire state, the long-term outcome could have been a thriving regional food system — so that in time, Coloradans could purchase local, sustainable, and highly nutritious food not just at farmer’s markets, but from grocery stores and restaurants.
Most of the food in Colorado grocery stores is produced and processed out of state or internationally then shipped to various warehouses across North America before being shelved in King Soopers, Trader Joe’s or elsewhere. This globalized and opaque system obscures food production from consumers, facilitating the concealment of environmental and humanitarian issues in American food supply chains (such as excessive pesticide use, child labor, deforestation). Regional food systems, or systems in which food is produced, processed and consumed all within the same region, offer an alternative paradigm for feeding Coloradans. Regional food systems reduce food waste, increase farmers’ profit margins, generate local jobs, and strengthen local economies. And by supporting small- and mid-sized farmers growing diverse crops, regional food systems protect biodiversity, improve soil quality, and reduce energy use.
The local food purchasing programs accomplished the non-controversial goals of stimulating local economies and feeding people in need — so what instigated the Trump administration’s ire?
Because the administration offered no explanation, the answer may only be conjectured: perhaps because these programs emphasize supporting socially disadvantaged food producers, and almost certainly because the Trump administration is determined to dismantle Biden-era initiatives, regardless of their merit. And on the surface, cutting local food purchasing programs aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to rein in unnecessary spending (a subjective assessment) in the name of government efficiency.
Yet, these claims of government efficiency ring especially hollow and hypocritical considering that ongoing inefficient government spending is the reason these programs are necessary in the first place — $478 billion of subsidies benefitted the nation’s largest and wealthiest farms between 2015 and 2022, creating an uneven playing field for the country’s small- and mid-sized food producers. The approximately $1 billion budget for local food purchasing programs is a drop in the bucket compared to the subsidies lavished on farmers that don’t even grow food for people. Instead they farm corn, soy and other commodity crops to create ethanol, livestock feed, and other products.
Regardless of the justification and injustice driving the termination of the USDA’s local food purchasing programs, they leave a void that needs filling. The benefits of strong regional food systems are too great to neglect, and the programs were too successful to abandon. The state of Colorado must step up to support farmers, ranchers and food insecure people. And because the state is currently struggling with a $1 billion budget deficit, additional government spending requires more state income. To support regional food systems and food security, state legislators should look into creating an enterprise, or otherwise refer a small excise tax on soft drinks to the ballot for Coloradans to vote on.
Boulder, which adopted a soft drink excise tax in 2016, demonstrates the profitably of such taxes — so far, it has generated $29 million for health-related programs. If expanded throughout the entire state, an excise tax on soft drinks could provide a huge sum to fund regional food systems and other state priorities, like healthy meals for all public schools. According to an online calculator developed by the University of Connecticut Center for Food Policy and Health, a $0.02/ounce excise tax on soft drinks in Colorado would have generated between $227 million and $287 million in 2023 (depending on the tax pass through rate).
Colorado leaders face a difficult task: maintaining Coloradan’s quality of life and rights, as well as the state’s environmental and social prerogatives despite opposition at the federal level. An arsenal of state policies is necessary to combat perverse federal policy decisions, and policies to resuscitate local food purchasing programs should be a top priority — for the sake of food insecure Coloradans, local food producers, and the state’s regional food systems.

(Photo: Office of the Governor)The spectacle of politicians preaching one thing and doing another, and of criticizing others for action that they too might have taken in similar circumstances, is nothing particularly new. Sometimes, it’s just a reflection of the fact that it’s a lot easier to be an outsider in opposition than it is to be on the inside trying to govern. Other times, it’s a function of the old adage, “success has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan.”
That said, the hypocritical double standards at work on the modern political right these days in the era of Donald Trump are often enough to make your head spin.
Consider the recent “Signalgate” scandal in which Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic in a text chain that also included Director of National Intelligence Chief Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President JD Vance as they discussed a planned military operation.
As 82nd Airborne veteran Scott Peoples pointed out in a recent op-ed for NC Newsline, under many circumstances, soldiers guilty of divulging such sensitive operational plans could expect a dishonorable discharge and possible imprisonment. Unfortunately, the sound one hears thus far in response to the Trump team’s remarkable foul-up in most conservative circles is that of crickets chirping.
One can only imagine the deafening roar of complaints we’d be hearing from Fox News shouters and Republican politicians right now if it had been members of a Kamala Harris administration that had committed such an outrageous breach of national security. Demands to fire the responsible officials would be at a fever pitch, and U.S. House Republicans would probably already be scheduling presidential impeachment hearings.
And the same hypocrisy would undoubtedly play out closer to home as well. Consider the following scenario.
As has been well-documented in recent weeks, Trump, with the help of his unelected immigrant billionaire sidekick Elon Musk, has moved unilaterally to effect a massive and chaotic bloodletting of the federal government. From the attempted elimination of the U.S. Department of Education to the evisceration of several other key departments — including, amazingly enough, the National Weather Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs — Trump and Musk have moved, without legislative authorization, to end or dramatically reduce funding for a host of programs and initiatives that do not reflect their views and values.
But, of course, as is the case with the U.S. government and Trump, the state of North Carolina has long funded statewide and local programs and initiatives opposed by its current chief executive, Gov. Josh Stein.
Likely topping the list: the state’s massive private school voucher program. North Carolina Republican lawmakers have been funneling billions of public dollars to unaccountable and discriminatory private schools for years, even as they have consistently refused to adequately fund traditional public schools.
Or consider the legislature’s repeated allocation of millions of dollars to the black hole that is the state’s network of so-called “crisis pregnancy centers” — completely unaccountable propaganda shops that often masquerade as health providers and generally exist to promote and funnel money to anti-abortion advocacy.
Or how about any number of newly funded programs bestowed by GOP lawmakers on Republican Council of State members like, say, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler?
Just imagine if Stein — who controls the state budget office, after all — tried to follow Trump’s example by issuing executive orders directing administration officials to simply cancel government programs he disliked.
Funding for school vouchers and crisis pregnancy centers: Gone. New employees at Council of State departments led by Republicans: Fired.
Suffice it so to say that Republican lawmakers and right-wing lobby groups loyal to Trump would be apoplectic.
Moves that, when taken by Dear Leader Trump, have been met with full-throated huzzahs (see, for example, North Carolina Fifth District Congresswoman Rep. Virginia Foxx’s recent embarrassing, kneejerk endorsement of Trump’s destructive and illegal scheme to eliminate the Department of Education), would attract guttural screams of outrage.
School privatization and anti-abortion groups would angrily accuse Stein of being a dictator out to steal their freedoms.
Meanwhile, GOP legislative leaders like Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall would beat a path from the Legislative Building over to Berger’s son and the other Republican denizens of the state Supreme Court building faster than you can say “legislative rubber stamp.”
Of course, the big and critical difference in such a scenario from the current situation at the national level is that Gov. Stein would never take such actions. Unlike both Trump and Musk, Stein is a smart and skilled attorney and an honest and responsible leader who actually believes in constitutional government and the rule of law. While he may disagree with numerous programs funded by the state government he leads, he understands his obligation to abide by the rules and that there are limits to his power.
Would that Trump and the hypocritical political puppets he controls were of the same admirable character.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gov.-Stein-signs-relief-bill-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Mitch McConnell in a way that reminds people of what Judas did to Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
Over the years, McConnell’s hard work almost single-handedly built the Republican Party of Kentucky into the state’s majority party. McConnell made it possible 15 years ago for a former government lawyer like Barr to even dream of running for Congress in Central Kentucky.  
Without McConnell, there would be no Congressman Barr, and for years Barr followed McConnell’s lead in voting to protect Social Security, veteran, and a strong military.  Sadly, Barr has gone weak and fainted into the arms of multi-billionaire government contractor Elon Musk.
As with Judas, there’s a reason for Barr’s radical reversal: he’s doing it for Elon’s money. If money is the root of all evil, Musk’s campaign contributions are certainly at the heart of Barr’s treachery toward McConnell.
Barr’s in frantic pursuit of McConnell’s Senate seat, so he’s ditching his long-time ally and desperately chasing Elon. In years to come, Barr’s lust for Musk’s money and his betrayal of McConnell will be remembered as one of the most despicable double crosses in Kentucky political history.

McConnell’s a constitutional conservative, and as the nation’s founders intended, he’s always stood up for the budget-making power of Congress, the branch of government closest to the people.  
In contrast, and for Elon’s money, Barr is cheerleading for Musk, an unelected rich guy who’s plundering tax dollars that were appropriated by law (with Barr’s votes) and trying to pull the plug on Social Security so it can be handed over to Wall Street bankers. 
Elon calls Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and Barr smiles and says: “Thank you sir, may I have another.” 
Musk is a South African native who dumped about $300 million into last year’s presidential campaign. That money bought him a big government job, and with Barr’s approval, Elon is using his position to decimate programs that support Kentucky veterans and the military, Social Security, Medicare, national parks, public schools, cancer research, and disaster aid for flood victims.  Musk can also use his position to steer billions of taxpayer dollars to his private businesses.
  U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)
For Elon’s money, and another slap in McConnell’s face, Barr is supporting tariffs that amount to a national sales tax. Tariffs will increase inflation, and cause chaos in the stock market and the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
Both McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul are telling Barr — in Paul’s words — “Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.”
Contrary to Barr’s new position on tariffs, McConnell explained that they “could have long-term consequences (on Kentucky’s) 75,000 family farms that sell their crops around the globe, the hardworking Kentuckians who craft 95 percent of the world’s bourbon, (and) our auto industry that relies on global supply chains to support the livelihoods of thousands of workers in the commonwealth.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Last summer, the city of Richmond made waves by announcing a $3 million dollar check for its residents to spend as they see fit. Now, the city is handing the reins over to its people, inviting everyone 14 years and older to vote on how that money should be allocated. From April 1 to 15, Richmonders can head to pop-up events around the city or log on to cast their votes for the projects they want to see funded in what the city has dubbed “The People’s Budget.”
Ideas on the table range from improvements to bus routes, tree plantings in underserved areas, and sidewalk enhancements for pedestrian safety, to more region-specific projects, like a “Welcome to Southside” sign at entry points to Richmond’s 8th City Council district, or better trail access to the James River in the 5th District. 
Instead of just picking one project, the process uses ranked choice voting, allowing participants to express preference for several initiatives. The People’s Budget initiative, which was led by former city councilor and mayoral candidate Andreas Addison, started with other pop-up events and online solicitation to gather input from residents across the city. 
As for the $3 million, it’s being divided across the city with a focus on equity. Isaac Samuels, lead organizer of the People’s Budget, explained that Districts 1, 2 and 4 will each get $200,000, while Districts 3, 5 and 7 will receive $300,000 each, and Districts 6, 8 and 9 will be allocated $500,000. The goal of this varied distribution is to direct funding to areas that have historically been underinvested in, ensuring that all of Richmond’s neighborhoods benefit.
Richmond’s Southside, home to many historically Black neighborhoods, has long faced challenges rooted in systemic inequality. Less tree canopy in these areas leads to higher ground temperatures during hot months, and a history of discriminatory housing policies has contributed to lower home values. 
In the 1930s, appraisers marked Black-populated neighborhoods nationwide in red, labeling them “hazardous” for home loans. The lasting impact of these racist practices is still evident today, with each negative appraisal continuing to affect future evaluations and resulting in less local government investment in public infrastructure.
“This is a big milestone for us,” Samuels said.
After months of outreach and community engagement, Samuels is thrilled to reach the voting phase, knowing the projects selected will soon become a reality. With voting ending on April 15, he expects the results to be available by April 21. 
From there, the implementation of winning proposals will vary based on which city  departments are involved and the procedural steps leading up to any development work. 
“We will be tracking it basically like a Domino’s Pizza Tracker on our website, noting every different step that we’re taking,” Samuels said.
 Ranked choice voting

Ranked choice voting gives Richmond residents a better shot at seeing their favorite projects come to life. If their top choice doesn’t get enough votes, their other picks may still make the cut, giving them a greater sense of influence over the outcome.
This voting method has gained traction in Virginia in recent years. Former state delegate Sally Hudson carried legislation that was signed into law in 2020, allowing localities to adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections. Arlington was the first to use it in 2023, and Charlottesville is set to implement it this year. 
Richmond nearly became the first locality to adopt it in 2022, but city councilors were still unsure and ultimately voted it down. A major concern was that the law couldn’t be applied to school boards or citywide elections contests like Richmond’s mayor, who, unlike most Virginia localities, is separately elected instead of being a member of the city council. 
This year, a bill from Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, aimed to expand ranked choice voting, but it was recently vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin, who used ranked choice voting to secure his victory in the 2021 Republican gubernatorial convention, explained in his veto that more data was needed before expanding the method. 
He said doing so at this stage “risks institutionalizing a system that has yet to prove its effectiveness in broader elections.”
However, Hudson, now executive director of Ranked Choice Virginia, argues that Youngkin is overlooking “the growing body of evidence” showing successful ranked choice voting trials. 
Arlington has already used it in several elections, and Falls Church and Loudoun county are also considering adopting it. Both Hudson and UpVote Virginia executive director Liz White have pointed to expanding use of ranked choice voting nationwide. 
“I definitely see an increase in just people being familiar with it. I think that that, for us, is the biggest measure of progress,” White said. “The more people use it, the more people know about it, the more they like it.”
While more local elections are still waiting for the ability to use this method, White is thrilled to see it applied in Richmond’s People’s Budget. 
“There’s more nuance to (residents’) votes and they can provide so much more information with their vote,” White said. “I think that’s really cool.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)This year’s General Assembly session notably failed to produce legislation addressing the widening gap between electricity demand and supply in Virginia. Legislators shied away from measures that would address the growing demand from data centers, but they also couldn’t bring themselves to improve the supply picture by supporting landowners who want to host solar facilities. By the time the session ended, a mere handful of bills had passed that could improve our ability to meet demand.  
Still, the initiatives that did pass offered positive steps forward on energy efficiency, distributed generation, interconnection of rooftop solar, energy storage, EV charging and utility planning. In addition, two data center-related bills passed requiring more planning and transparency during the local permitting process and tasking utilities with developing a demand response program to relieve some of the added burden on the grid.
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Sadly, however, Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin decided to use his powers of veto and amendment to water down or scuttle the limited (and mostly bipartisan) progress legislators made. The only two data center bills were effectively killed, as were most energy bills – some by veto, others by amendments that made them worse than no action at all. 
There’s nothing very subtle going on here. The governor loves data centers and isn’t about to limit their growth, regardless of the consequences to residential ratepayers and communities. He’s also stuck in a rut of attacking the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which prioritizes low-cost renewable energy over legacy fossil fuels. He won’t be in office when the chickens come home to roost in the form of an electricity shortfall and skyrocketing rates, but he’s setting up his party to cast blame on the liberal climate agenda.   
 Data centers

The General Assembly failed to pass legislation that would have shifted responsibility for sourcing clean energy onto the data center operators. The only bill to pass that even makes energy a consideration in the siting of data centers is HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Gainesville. In addition to site assessment provisions at the permitting stage, it requires the utility serving the facility to describe any new electric generating units, substations and transmission voltage that would be required.
Facing data center sprawl and an energy crisis, Virginia lawmakers leap into action. Just kidding.

Limited as these provisions are, the governor proposed amendments to further weaken the bill, then added a clause requiring that for the bill to take effect, it has to be passed all over again in 2026. That’s a veto by another name. 
SB 1047 from Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, requires utilities to implement demand-response programs for customers with a power demand of more than 25 MW, a way of  relieving grid constraints during times of high demand. The governor vetoed the bill, deeming it unnecessary. 
The only data center-related bill that did get the governor’s approval is one of questionable utility. HB 2084 from Del. Irene Shin, D-Herndon, merely requires the SCC to use its existing authority during a regular proceeding sometime in the next couple of years to determine whether Dominion and Appalachian Power are using reasonable customer classifications in setting rates, and if not, whether new classifications are reasonable. The SCC seems to be doing this already anyway, but maybe this lets our leaders claim they are doing something to protect residential ratepayers. Plus, they can now call it a bipartisan effort!
 Utility reform

 With Virginia fixed on a collision course between growing demand for energy from data centers and our leaders’ refusal to support low-cost solar to provide the power, it is more important than ever that our utilities engage in transparent and comprehensive planning through the integrated resource plans (IRPs) filed with the State Corporation Commission. Over the course of last fall, the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation hammered out what I think is truly good legislation to ensure Dominion and APCo present the information the SCC and the public need to be sure our utilities are making the decisions that will improve our energy position and put the needs of ratepayers ahead of corporate profits. 
In vetoing SB 1021 from Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and HB 2413 from Del. Candi Munyon-King, D-Dumfries, the governor offered this muddled statement: “The State Corporation Commission has the expertise and the authority to make requirements and changes to the integrated resource plan process. The Virginia Clean Economy Act is failing Virginia and those that champion it should stop trying to buttress this failing policy. But rather should be focused on procuring the dependable power needed to meet our growing demand through optimizing for reliability, affordability, and increasingly clean power generation.”
We get it: Johnny One-Note doesn’t like the VCEA. He said that already. But right now, APCo isn’t filing IRPs at all, and the SCC has been so frustrated with Dominion’s filings that it didn’t approve the last one, and demanded a supplement to the most recent one even before it was filed. Clearly the SCC could use a little help here.  
 Distributed energy sources

Advocates for small-scale solar were more successful this year than their colleagues who focus on utility-scale projects. Bipartisan majorities seemed to agree that if we can’t or won’t site large solar farms, at least we should make it easier to put solar on rooftops and other small sites close to users.
Utility regulator recommends suspension of Dominion’s rules for connecting new solar to grid

Sadly, however, only one bill survived the governor’s scrutiny relatively unscathed, though it’s an important one for customer-sited solar. HB 2266 from Del. Kathy Tran, D-Springfield, resolves the interconnection dispute that has stalled commercial solar projects in the 250 kW to 3 MW size range, which includes most rooftop solar on schools. Tran’s bill requires the SCC to approve upgrades to the distribution system that utilities say are needed to accommodate grid-connected solar, a safeguard that will prevent the utility from larding on costs. The utility must then spread the costs across all projects that benefit from the expanded capacity. 
Youngkin’s proposed amendment rearranges the language a bit and places it into a new section of code, but does not otherwise change it. He then adds a provision in the tax code to make grid upgrades tax-deductible. I would have thought they would be anyway, as business expenses, but it can only be helpful to spell it out.  
Unfortunately, that’s it for the good news. 
HB 1883 from Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Charlottesville, and SB 1040 from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Richmond, contain several provisions aimed at increasing the amount of distributed solar in Virginia. Among other things, the legislation increases the percentage of Dominion’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) obligation that must be met with renewable energy certificates (RECs) from behind-the-meter small solar projects, a change that would make rooftop and other distributed solar more profitable for homeowners and businesses. 
HB 1883 also increases to 3 MW from 1 MW the size of solar projects that could qualify for this favored category. Additionally, for the first time it would give all residential ratepayers the right to use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to install solar with no money down, and would increase the amount of electricity Dominion would build or buy from solar facilities on previously developed project sites. To give the market a chance to ramp up, Callsen’s bill excuses Dominion from having to meet its REC obligations from Virginia projects for an additional two years, pushing that date from this year to 2027. 
Among all those changes, the only one the governor liked is the idea of softening the requirements around REC purchases. His proposed amendment would make all REC compliance voluntary for four years. Effectively, Virginia would have no renewable energy requirements until 2028, undercutting solar development of any size. His preferred version scraps all of the provisions of Callsen’s bill, leaving no provisions to support solar development and replacing them with an open attack on the VCEA. 
I checked in with Callsen by email to get her reaction. She responded, “We sent the administration bipartisan legislation that protects ratepayers, gives Virginians more options for solar on our homes and businesses, and saves rural land. Rather than sign HB 1883 into law,” Callsen wrote, “the governor used this opportunity to attack the Clean Economy Act from 2020. Instead of looking at the past, our Administration should look around; we have a developing energy crisis and are reliant on importing energy to meet our needs.”
The governor also offered a destructive amendment to HB 2346 from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, and SB 1100 from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, legislation establishing a pilot program in Dominion territory for virtual power plants (VPPs), which aggregate customer solar and storage resources and demand response capabilities. Although VPPs don’t by themselves add electricity on the grid, they allow time-shifting and other efficiencies that make it easier for utilities to meet peak demand without having to build new generation. The payments utilities make to customers for this service can justify customers’ investments in things like solar, battery storage and smart appliances.  
Instead of improving on the pilot program, however, the governor’s amendment scraps it and calls for the SCC to convene a proceeding to talk about VPPs. On the plus side, Youngkin suggests that the conversation include Appalachian Power as well as Dominion, and consider allowing the service to be provided by either the utilities or third-party aggregators, the latter being the favored approach of many industry members. Still, the amendment pushes off any hope of a program for at least another year, until the SCC has made its recommendations. Since it would have been feasible to both start a pilot program this year and have the SCC consider parameters for a broader program in the future, it’s hard to see the governor’s amendment as a step forward. 
When I asked her for a comment, Hashmi did not mince words, saying it was “incredibly disappointing” that Youngkin chose to offer a substitute instead of signing the legislation.
“This legislation was the result of several months of conversation among a variety of stakeholders, including our utility companies, energy partners, and environmental groups. The Virtual Power Plant has the promise of helping Virginia meet the goals of our increasing energy demands. The Governor’s substitute shows that he is not serious about responding to the growth of Virginia’s energy needs,” Hashmi wrote.
Other solar bills drew outright vetoes, including Munyon King’s HB 2356, establishing an apprenticeship program to help develop a clean energy workforce. The bill requires participants to be paid prevailing wages, a provision that was a certain veto magnet for Youngkin, whose veto statement reads, “This bill will increase the construction costs which will ultimately be passed along to ratepayers, raising costs for consumers.”
Another bill that drew an outright veto was HB 2037 from Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax. His bill would allow local governments to include in their land development ordinances a requirement that certain non-residential applicants install solar on a portion of a parking lot. 
The governor vetoed it because, he said, it would be expensive for developers, and if it weren’t, they would do it without having to be told. (It’s a strange objection. Does he not understand the whole concept of government acting in the public good? Well, maybe not; see the veto.)
Also vetoed was Shin’s HB 2090, changing the rules around multifamily solar. Admittedly I was not crazy about this bill; although it allows solar facilities to be placed on nearby commercial buildings instead of being restricted to the multifamily building itself, it also imports the requirement for minimum bills that has made other shared solar programs in Virginia unworkable for all but the low-income customers who are excused from the minimum bills. 
Maybe the trade-off would have opened new opportunities for apartment buildings serving low-income households, which would make it a plus on balance. But among his objections to HB2090, the governor noted that excusing low-income customers from high minimum bills would shift costs onto other customers. 
 Energy efficiency

The governor vetoed SB 1342 from Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond, and HB 2744 from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Franconia, that would have pushed Dominion and APCo harder to provide energy efficiency upgrades to low-income homes, setting a target of 30% of qualifying households. 
He also vetoed SB 777 from Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and HB 1935 from Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, D-Richmond, which would have established a task force to address the needs of low-income customers for weatherization and efficiency upgrades. The governor said it isn’t needed. 
If you notice a pattern here when it comes to helping low-income households with their energy burden, you are not alone. 
Reached on maternity leave,  LeVere Bolling had this to say: “Across our Commonwealth, high utility bills are forcing Virginians to choose between essentials like groceries and medication and keeping their home at a safe temperature during hot summers and cold winters. Virginia has the 10th least affordable residential energy bills in the country. Over 75% of Virginia households have an energy burden higher than the 6% affordability threshold.” She added that the governor’s veto represents a “missed opportunity to address the pressing energy needs of Virginia’s most vulnerable communities.”
  Electric vehicles

The governor offered a substitute for a bill intended to support electric vehicle charging. As passed by the General Assembly, Shin’s HB 2087 requires Dominion and APCo to file detailed plans to “accelerate transportation electrification,” including for rural areas and economically disadvantaged communities. It also allows the utilities to file proposed tariffs with the SCC to supply the distribution infrastructure necessary for EV charging stations. 
The utilities are also authorized to develop their own fast-charging stations, but only at a distance from privately-owned charging stations, with the SCC determining the proper distance. This provision responds to the request of gas station chains like Sheetz that say they want to expand their EV charging options, but don’t want to face unfair competition from utilities that can rate-base their investments.
The governor’s amendment would prohibit Dominion and APCo from owning EV charging stations at all; in addition, it would allow retail providers of EV charging stations to buy electricity from any competitive service provider. However, the amendment repeals the section of code that allows the utilities to recover costs of investments in transportation electrification.  
According to Steve Banashek, EV legislative lead with the Virginia Sierra Club, that “negates the purpose of the enrolled bill.” The amendment, he told me in an email, “removes the requirement for utilities to file for tariffs to support implementation of EV charging and to plan for transportation electrification growth via the IRP process, which is critical for speeding up the transition to electric transportation.” 
As for the prohibition on the utilities owning charging stations, Banashek noted that there are areas of the state where private businesses aren’t likely to do it, including in those economically disadvantaged and rural communities. If we don’t want these areas left behind, either the utilities have to step up, or the state does.  
Apparently, however, Youngkin doesn’t intend for the state to do it either. Along with his amendments to Shin’s bill, the governor also vetoed HB 1791 from Sullivan, creating a fund to support EV charging in rural areas of the state.  
 Energy storage

The need for more energy storage seems like it would be one area of bipartisan consensus. Batteries and other forms of energy storage are critical to filling in the generation gaps for low-cost, intermittent forms of energy like wind and solar. 
But storage is also required to make full use of baseload sources like nuclear that either can’t be ramped down at times when there is a surplus of energy being produced, or where doing so makes it harder to recover the cost of building the generation. (The already-high projected cost of electricity from small modular nuclear reactors becomes even higher if you assume they don’t run when the power isn’t needed.) 
Sullivan’s HB 2537 increases the energy storage targets for Dominion and APCo, and includes new targets for long-duration energy storage. Unfortunately, Youngkin’s substitute language repeals the entire section of code that includes Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard as well as even the existing storage targets. It’s another bit of anti-VCEA flag-waving that won’t help anyone.  
Just in case you thought Youngkin might be adhering to conservative free market principles with some kind of consistency, I note that he signed HB 2540 and SB 1207 from two Republicans, Del. Danny Marshall of Danville and Sen. Tammy Brankley Mulchi of Clarksville, which provides a $60 million grant to a manufacturer of lithium-ion battery separators. 
I asked Sullivan for a comment on the governor’s action on his bill. He replied, “The Governor’s ridiculous ‘recommendation’ on HB 2537 was disappointing, but hardly surprising. This was not an amendment; he deleted everything – everything – having to do with energy storage, and turned it into a one-sentence bill which would repeal the entire Clean Economy Act.”
Moreover, wrote Sullivan, “HB 2537 was the most closely and extensively negotiated bill among stakeholders that I’ve been involved with since the VCEA. It had broad support – including from Dominion – and should have easily fit into the Governor’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy and his economic development goals, since it would have brought all sorts of business, jobs, and companies to the Commonwealth.”  
Sullivan concluded, “Needless to say, we cannot agree to the amendment.  We’ll easily pass this bill next session, and I suspect Governor Spanberger will sign it.” 
Sullivan may be right that it will take a new administration before Virginia gets serious about meeting its energy challenges – if it does even then – but this session needn’t have ended in a partisan stalemate and near-zero progress. Most of the bills the governor vetoed or gutted were passed with the help of Republicans, making Youngkin’s actions less of a rebuke to Democrats than to the members of his own party who were simply trying to do their job. The results, sadly, are bad for everyone.

The issue of how best to provide services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is, admittedly, a challenging one.
Complex questions about the roles played by institutions and sheltered workshops, and the leeway given to families to chart their own courses in finding services, give rise to many competing and legitimate opinions.
That said, there’s one simple truth about IDD services in North Carolina that’s indisputable: they are inadequate.
Thanks to chronic underfunding by state legislators, the waiting list for coveted slots in the Innovations Waiver program is absurdly long. Indeed, there are more people waiting — over seventeen thousand — than there are people enrolled. It takes years to get through the waiting list and many people die before they ever do.
The bottom line: Several factors may feed into this scandalous situation but ultimately, they’re all rooted in the fact that our state’s cheapskate legislature refuses to appropriate the funds that would make it possible to attract and hire enough support workers. And until it does, thousands of families will continue to suffer.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Holdout states consider expanding Medicaid — with work requirements

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Students donning black graduation robes held a mock funeral for the death of higher education after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that will overhaul the state’s public universities. 
The Ohio Student Association organized the event, which took place Monday afternoon in the Statehouse Rotunda, days after DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1. 
S.B. 1 will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.

For classroom discussion, the bill will set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. It prohibits professors from “indoctrination,” and while it doesn’t define that, it allows complaints to be filed against professors for review by the Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education. S.B. 1 will only affect Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“It was really surprising, the quickness that it was signed,” said Ohio State University junior Brielle Shorter. “I think signing it at such a time was really interesting as well, but it was truly heartbreaking.”
DeWine got the bill Wednesday — the same day the Ohio Senate concurred with changes to the bill made by the Ohio House — and he signed it Friday. 
“As a Black student on campus, our spaces have already been slowly getting demolished,” Shorter said. “I believe that with this bill there’s going to be more changes like that.” 
Ohio State University is closing its Office of Diversity and Inclusion

Ohio State recently closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Office of Student Life’s Center for Belonging and Social Change in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s Dear Colleague letter that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships, and other aspects of student life.
Shorter said she has seen Ohio high school students post on social media how they are no longer interested in attending Ohio universities and instead plan to go to school out of state. 
Scott DiMauro, president of the Ohio Education Association, said it is unfortunate DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law.
“It’s disappointing to see that he did that, even though the overwhelming amount of opposition that was expressed on the bill from faculty and from students and from concerned citizens was strongly against it,” he said. “I think it’s unfortunate to see collective bargaining rights of people who work in higher education diminished.”
Pranav Jani, president of Ohio State’s American Association of University Professors chapter, said they will fight the impact of the bill as it becomes law. 
“We know that we stand with thousands of educators, students, and parents, who are disgusted by this naked display of governmental repression of higher education,” he said in a statement. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which took just over two months to pass both chambers and be signed into law. 
“I believe this is monumentally significant legislation that will allow Ohio’s public universities and community colleges to deal with looming enrollment challenges and usher in a renaissance of academic excellence,” Cirino said in a statement.

(Getty Images)If a New Hampshire parent wants to remove a book from their school district for being too obscene, the process depends on their district.
Some school boards have passed policies laying out an explicit mechanism to challenge books or other materials; others have much sparser language. 
This year, Republican lawmakers are seeking to make the process easier. The House and Senate are moving to require New Hampshire schools to allow parents to challenge books and other materials they deem obscene, and to create formal appeals processes for weighing those challenges.
“This bill is about materials that are harmful to minor children in schools and the ability for parents to object to them,” wrote Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican and the chairman of the House Education Policy and Administration Committee. 
But Democrats, public school advocates, and civil rights groups have strongly objected, arguing the new process could allow parents to target materials that tackle race and LGBTQ+ issues, and arguing that school districts should design their own policies.
A representative from Penguin Random House, the book publisher, submitted written testimony to the committee in early March objecting to the bill.
“HB 324 is problematic due to overly broad language, redundancy with existing laws, and potential intimidation of educators and librarians that will negatively affect book and material selection in New Hampshire’s schools and libraries,” wrote Skip Dye, the chairman of the publisher’s Intellectual Freedom Taskforce.
Dye continued: “Ultimately, it will deprive young readers access to literature that is crucial for their intellectual and emotional development. And without non-discrimination provisions, the lowered standard in this bill may be weaponized against minority voices.” 
The legislation echoes efforts by Republicans in past years. This year, lawmakers appear more likely to succeed. House Bill 324 passed the House on March 26, 183-148, along a near party line vote, while the Senate passed Senate Bill 33 on March 30 with a 16-8 vote. 
But the chambers don’t yet fully agree on key issues. The House-endorsed bill goes further than its Senate counterpart, including more appeals processes for parents and more potential penalties for schools. 
HB 324 would mandate that school boards pass policies that allow parents to complain that certain materials are harmful to minors and should be removed from the school district.
In order to be “harmful to minors,” the material must “predominantly appeal to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors”; must depict or describe nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse; must be “patently offensive to prevailing standards” of what is offense to minors; must lack “serious” literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value; and must be inappropriate to the age group to which it is available, according to the bill.
The material must meet all of those conditions in order to qualify as harmful, according to the bill. The material could include books, magazines, movies, pamphlets, recordings, photos, figures, statues, plays, dances, and any other visual presentation, web-based content, and live performance.
Under the bill, school boards must pass policies that allow a parent or guardian to make a complaint alleging that a teaching material in that school district violates the law. At that point, the school’s principal or a designee would have 14 calendar days to make a decision whether the material was in violation and whether it should be removed.
If the principal decided the material did not violate the law, the parent could appeal the decision to the school board. 
SB 33 requires a similar complaint process. 
But HB 324 adds two additional provisions that have vexed opponents. 
First, if the school board also rules against the complaining parent, that parent can appeal a final time to the State Board of Education, HB 324 states. The State Board’s decision is final. 
Second, under HB 324, school districts and individual teachers can face consequences if a material is decided to be prohibited and the school continues to provide that material anyway. School districts can be sued by parents; teachers and other staff can face disciplinary sanctions by the State Board of Education for violating the educator code of conduct. 
It is not clear which version of the legislation might pass both the House and Senate. The chambers could enter “committee of conference” negotiations to find agreement in June.
Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, says the association objects to HB 324 for two reasons: the potential liability it creates for school boards who are sued by parents, and the ability for the state board to override the school board’s authority over the materials.
“We think that the local school board should have the authority to determine what’s in their local libraries,” Christina said. He added: “The primary reason why we don’t think an appeal to the State Board of Education is appropriate is that it leaves voters without any local recourse. If the local school board chooses to keep a book in the library and the voters don’t like that decision, they can vote for new school board members at the next election.” 
Since 2004, the School Boards Association has had a model policy it has recommended that schools adopt that covers challenges to materials in school. And Christina says he understands the desire to standardize the process to reduce confusion, especially as book challenges have become more frequent in the past five years.
But to Christina, any policy passed by the Legislature should meet two criteria: There should be well-defined deadlines for parents and school officials, and there should be clear definitions for what type of material violates the statute. HB 324 doesn’t meet those criteria, he argued. 
Absent that clarity, the law could prompt school districts to agree to move more books than they should, he said. 
“Nobody wants to be sued and nobody wants to subject themselves to civil penalties,” Christina said. “So the potential is that it may create a chilling effect with respect to what books local school boards decide to keep in their libraries.” 
Speaking from the floor, Cordelli argued the state board should be included in the process. 
“HB 324 establishes a minimum process for which parents can bring what they consider inappropriate materials to their principal and the school board, and yes, if necessary, to the state board,” he said. “Because we have in statute a duty of the state board to hear complaints from parents.” 
Cordelli added: “This is not banning of books. It is about making sure that our children — your children — have books that are age-appropriate.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/librarybooks-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Dream Point can house as many as 40 people. (Photo: Bertie County Schools)Two bills filed in the North Carolina House in recent days would make it easier for local governments and developers to build, manage and maintain workforce housing.
House Bill 306 would authorize Blowing Rock, Boone, Watauga County and the Watauga County Board of Education to construct and provide affordable employee housing on property owned by the governmental units.
The bill comes as western North Carolina struggles to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which devastated the region a little more than six months ago. Approximately 73,700 homes in the region suffered damage and more than 8,800 homes had major damage or were destroyed. The price tag for housing assistance has been estimated at $15.4 billion.   
HB 306 was filed by Rep. Ray Pickett, a Blowing Rock Republican but has bipartisan support. Reps. Vernetta Alston and Zack Hawkins, both Durham Democrats, are among the bill’s cosponsors. Alston filed a bill last year to build allow workforce housing to be built in Durham.  The bill never got off the ground. Several previous attempts to get legislation passed to build workforce housing in Durham also failed to win support from Republican leader who control the General Assembly.
Under HB 306, the governmental units may provide workforce housing separately or through a partnership, joint venture, land trust or similar entity. It also authorizes them to contract to finance, construct or maintain affordable housing for local government employees and to rent or sell affordable housing for residential use exclusively to local government unit employees. Local governments may “charge below-market rates, offer below-market financing, and place reasonable restrictions and buyback provisions on the resale of housing units,” the bill states.
Workforce housing already exists in North Carolina and has been used by some counties to attract and retain teachers, particularly to rural regions where lower tax bases make it difficult to pay competitive local salary supplements. Local supplements are paid from local funds. It’s money teachers receive on top of state pay. Wealthier counties such as Durham, Orange and Wake can pay higher supplements.
Low wealth counties see workforce housing as a way to attract and retain teachers. Less than a year ago, Bertie County, one of the state’s low-wealth counties, opened a 24-unit, two-bedroom apartment complex it built to provide housing for as many as 40 teachers
“Rural communities like Bertie [County] often lose out attracting viable candidates to urban areas where there is shopping, great restaurants, entertainment and other amenities,” BCS Superintendent Otis Smallwood told Newsline last year. “In addition, Bertie County…is not able to pay teachers large local supplements like larger districts. Layer all of that with inadequate housing and you have a recipe for not being able to attract enough talent to educate the youth in our community. In many instances, we have to rely on recruiting international teachers.”
North Carolina already has several affordable housing projects for teachers. Duke TeachHouse in Durham, for example, is a living and learning community for early career teachers and graduates of Duke University’s teacher preparation programs. Others include Williams Baldwin Court in Asheville for teachers who work for Buncombe County Schools and Asheville City Schools, and Hertford Pointe in Ahoskie for Hertford County Schools’ teachers. The Dare County Education Foundation offers 24 housing units in Kill Devil Hills and 12 units in Hatteras for teachers employed by Dare County Schools.
Preconstruction loans for workforce housing
Another bill introduced in the House on Monday would create a revolving loan fund in the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to provide short-term financing to support preconstruction costs of workforce housing projects.
House Bill 603 was filed by Democratic Leader Robert Reives. It would create the Workforce Housing Preconstruction Revolving Loan Program to make loans available to developers before they obtain permanent, private financing.
Eligible uses for loans would include land surveys, environmental due diligence and soil testing, utility connections, planning and permit fees and site clearing and grading. Loans would be capped at $1 million.
Under HB 603, 80% of projects would be reserved for counties designated as development Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas. Counties with those designations are among the state’s most economically distressed.  The remaining 20% would be reserved for projects in, wealthier Tier 3 areas.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislation touted by GOP leaders as making South Carolina’s tax code appear more competitive would require most tax filers to pay more initially, according to an analysis by state fiscal experts.
Collapsing South Carolina’s tax brackets into a single flat tax rate of 3.99% in 2026 would reduce state revenues by $216.6 million overall.
But that’s done by broadening and shifting the tax burden: 19.4% of filers would owe less in spring 2027, while a whopping 59.4% of filers would owe more; 21.2% would experience no change, according to the fiscal impact report by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office released ahead of Tuesday’s first hearing on the bill.


An income tax shift
The bill proposes collapsing SC’s three tax brackets to a flat 3.99% in 2026. How that would shift the liability for tax filings due in spring 2027:

19.4% would see a collective decrease of $1.16 billion
21.2% of tax filers would see no change
59.5% would see a collective increase of $938.7 million

Source: S.C. Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office


The analysis cautions against generalizing: “The impact on individual taxpayers varies widely within each range depending on the specific tax situation of each tax filer,” reads the seven-page summary signed by the office’s director, Frank Rainwater.
Still, the report provides hard estimates on how many South Carolina taxpayers will pay more versus less — and the extent of the swings per taxpayers’ income levels after all applicable deductions, exemptions and tax credits are applied to reduce their reported earnings.
Of the nearly 1.7 million tax filers expected to pay more in state income taxes under the plan, their increase for calendar year 2026 will average $560, with hikes ranging from $98 on the low end of income levels to over $10,000 for taxpayers reporting more than $1 million in adjusted income.
That compares to about 550,000 tax filers who will see an average decrease of $2,110.
Thanks to a new personal income deduction for low-income earners, several hundred people at the bottom end of the pay scale would see an average decrease of $3,700, while tens of thousands of people reporting $30,000 to $50,000 of income would see a dip of less than $40.
On the top end of the scale, roughly 9,900 tax filers reporting more than $1 million would see their income tax liability plummet by an average of $31,000.
More people would be contributing to state coffers.
Under the proposal, 23% of tax filers would still pay zero in income taxes. But that compares to roughly 45% currently, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
“Everybody has to pay something — a little something, at least — to be a part of this great state of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster said last week when the plan was announced.
The new personal adjustment would provide a $6,000 deduction for single filers making up to $30,000, then provide some relief up to $40,000 of income. Married couples filing jointly could deduct $12,000 for incomes up to $60,000, with the deduction phasing out at $80,000.
Republicans’ ‘historic’ tax-cut plan attempts to give SC competitive edge

Still, looking at South Carolinians reporting an adjusted gross income between zero and $40,000, nearly 714,400 tax filers will owe more, while fewer than 20,000 would pay less.
The plan accomplishes what Republicans have long wanted: a tax structure that looks to be among the nation’s lowest. Collapsing three tax brackets to 3.99% would make South Carolina’s flat tax rate the lowest in the Southeast, except for Florida and Tennessee, which don’t have a state income tax.
In 2022, the Legislature passed a law that phased in a tax cut of more than $1 billion, but it still left the top marginal rate as the highest in the Southeast this year at 6.2%. However, the effective rate — what tax filers actually pay — was among the nation’s lowest even before the 2022 law.
The bill promises to keep cutting the rate as revenue collections increase. For every year income tax projections rise by 5%, the bill would reduce revenue by another $200 million until the tax rate gets to 2.49%.
When and if that happens, then the bill would truly be a tax cut for the overwhelming majority of South Carolinians: More than 77% of tax filers would see a collective decrease in their income taxes of $2.5 billion, compared to tax year 2026; 23% would still see no change whatsoever, but no one would pay more.
How many years it would take to get to 2.49% would depend on the economy and income growth.
Advocates promise to make the Legislature’s ruling Republicans feel the pressure to pass the bill.
The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity announced last week plans to launch a “six figure campaign” urging legislators to approve the plan. The group’s marketing push will include mailings, as well as online and radio ads and an “unmatched grassroots presence” going door to door asking residents to call their legislators.

Period.
But now Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and some other Republican attorneys general are in court defending President Donald Trump’s executive order claiming that “birthright citizenship” doesn’t extend to children of the undocumented.
 Trump also claims the power to unilaterally deny citizenship to babies of those with “lawful but temporary” presence in the United States. 
The arguments made by Trump, Yost, and the other attorneys general are “just silly,” a Cleveland immigration attorney said. And she added that they further endanger some of the most vulnerable.
Trump issued the executive order on his first day in office. It claims that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution doesn’t guarantee citizenship to babies born to undocumented immigrants or those with temporary status, such as holders of student or visitors’ visas.
The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to those babies. The courts blocked enforcement of the order a few weeks later. Trump is appealing the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump wants Supreme Court to let him mostly carry out birthright citizenship order

On March 20, Yost took to X to defend the president’s stance.
“Birthright citizenship in the United States is limited by the Constitution to those persons who are ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,'” he wrote. “Those words must mean something, and they mean *at least* this: it doesn’t include those who are here illegally.”
Unsettling
Yost is running in the 2026 governor’s race, and he’s shown sympathy with some of Trump’s extreme statements about immigrants as he has. 
Trump and now-Vice President J.D. Vance last summer repeated the lie that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were stealing neighbors’ pets and eating them. That prompted dozens of bomb threats to elementary schools and other public buildings in the small Ohio city, which Vance was then representing in the U.S. Senate. 
Yost, Ohio’s top law-enforcement officer, piled on, criticizing the news media for taking the word of the Springfield police chief over rumors as they assessed whether the racist claims were true.
Now Yost is backing Trump’s claims about birthright citizenship.
The right is embedded in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified 1868 in the wake of the Civil War. Its main purpose was to safeguard the rights of newly freed slaves and repudiate the 1857 Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v Sandford. 
That decision held that slaves and former slaves were not citizens and therefore could not sue in the federal courts. It is widely regarded as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever rendered — largely because it was rooted in racist dogma.
Blacks “had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit,” Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote in the decision.
The ruling was a key factor in provoking a civil war that killed more than 35,000 Ohioans. After it was over, the Constitution was amended to expand citizenship rights and ensure that the forces of racism could not trample them.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the first section of the amendment says. “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
“Some dumb campaign promise”
A century-and-a-half later, Trump is trying to narrow the application of those rights by presidential decree.
Yost and 16 other Republican attorneys general signed on with Iowa AG Brenna Bird in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Trump’s executive order. While the 14th Amendment was intended to expand citizenship rights, the brief seeks to limit them.
“This case is not about whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed under our Constitution,” the brief says. “It is. Instead, the proper framing of this case asks where the limits of birthright citizenship end.”
Regardless of the merits of that claim, the brief ignores an even more fundamental issue — whether the president has the power to unilaterally declare the courts’ long-running interpretation of the U.S. Constitution null and void, said Heather Prendergast, a Cleveland immigration attorney.
“The whole thing seems so silly to me,” she said. “It’s a joke. (Trump) made some dumb campaign promise that he really doesn’t have the authority to produce. Then he says on day one, ‘Here’s an executive order doing something I can’t do, but I’ve convinced myself is possible.'”
She added, “This is not something the president has the authority to do via executive order. Our government has three branches. If they wanted to change the rules regarding birthright citizenship, it would require an act of Congress, a constitutional amendment. The president doesn’t make the laws. He executes the laws. He doesn’t just get to say, ‘Today this is how we’re going to interpret birthright citizenship.'” 
Third judge blocks Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship

In a January interview with Harvard Law Today, law school Professor Gerald Newman said much the same thing.
“The president of the United States has no authority to change citizenship rules at all,” he said.
Who is subject?
Yost’s office didn’t respond to a series of questions for this story other than to refer to the friend-of-the-court brief. 
In it, Yost and his colleagues don’t address one extreme aspect of Trump’s executive order — that the children of people legally here on temporary visas aren’t automatically citizens under the 14th Amendment. 
They instead argue that those rights don’t extend to the children of undocumented immigrants. To support this argument, they claim that undocumented immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as required by the 14th Amendment.
“The Constitution never required every person who happened to be born on United States soil to be a citizen,” the Republican AGs’ brief says. “Nor is that the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'”
Never mind that in 1868 the United States had open borders, so the concept of being undocumented would have been alien to those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment. 
Writing in January, Alex Nowrasteh of the libertarian Cato Institute said arguments such as the one in the AGs’ brief misstate what the 14th Amendment says. The concept of birthright citizenship predates it in U.S. jurisprudence, and even goes back to 17th century English common law, he said.
Nowrasteh quoted U.S. Sen. Jacob Howard of Michigan who introduced the 14th Amendment. In a statement defending it, Howard said birthright citizenship extended to everybody, but “will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers” who have diplomatic immunity.
Trump and his supporters might try to torture that sentence into meaning undocumented immigrants and the babies of foreign diplomats are not entitled to birthright citizenship. But Nowrasteh said that goes against what Howard was plainly saying.
“Howard was describing the families of ambassadors as being foreigners and aliens,” Nowrasteh wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Case in point
Even after Congress began restricting who could become a citizen merely by coming here, the Supreme Court ruled that being born in the United States made one a citizen with two exceptions — being born to a foreign diplomat or to a member of an invading force.
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 placed a 10-year ban on Chinese immigration and prohibited Chinese who had already entered from getting citizenship. The legislation is considered highly racist because it singles out one ethnicity and it arose out of concern over the ethnic composition of the United States. Trump’s attempted Muslim bans have faced similar criticism.
Despite the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled in U.S. v Wong Kim Ark that children born on U.S. soil to non-diplomat Chinese parents are citizens.
As a young man in 1895, Wong Kim Ark visited China and was denied reentry to the United States. He took the matter to court and three years later, the justices ruled 6-2 that the 14th Amendment made him a citizen.
“The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States,” Justice Horace Gray wrote for the majority. “Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.”
In their brief, Yost and his colleagues claim that immigration laws passed after the 14th Amendment was ratified limit its scope.
“… Wong Kim Ark repeatedly emphasized that its facts involved lawful, permanent United States residents... ” the brief says. “Even its holding stressed the importance of lawful residence: ‘so long as they are permitted by the United States to reside here’… Wong Kim Ark did not address children born to illegal immigrants or birth tourists.”
However, that statement seems to ignore the plain language of the Supreme Court ruling — that Congress can’t pass laws that shrink the rights provided by the 14th Amendment.
“The acts of Congress known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the earliest of which was passed some fourteen years after the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, cannot control its meaning or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions,” it said.
In other words, statutes passed by Congress can’t trump the Constitution.
“The 1898 Supreme Court decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark established that the US-born children of immigrants were and remained citizens even if there were changes in law that would not have allowed them or their parents to legally immigrate here or naturalize,” wrote Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute.
Shaky justification
Prendergast, the Cleveland immigration lawyer, also questioned a key justification Yost and the Republican AGs gave in their attempt to limit birthright citizenship. 
The brief said it was important to remove incentives for undocumented people to come to the United States with the sole purpose of having citizen children. That implies that having citizen babies would make it easier for their parents to stay. And that ignores that it’s much, much harder than most people think for undocumented parents to get permanent residency, Prendergast said. 
“They act like somehow, birthright citizenship is a real draw; that people can come over here, have babies and somehow the babies themselves are going to acquire legal status for them,” Predergast said. “But a child can’t petition for their parents (to have permanent-resident status) until they’re 21 years old.”
She added that if the parents are in the United States without documents, they’re subject to more requirements when the child finally turns 21. In the vast majority of cases, they have to return to their home countries, go to a consulate, apply, and then wait 10 years.
Politicians’ talk of a border ‘invasion’ is speech that experts say has gotten people killed

“It’s a complicated process,” Predergast said.
The brief onto which Yost signed also echoes Trump’s claim that crossings at the southern border amount to an “invasion.” Despite their claims, Trump, Yost and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have never shown that the typically peaceful southern border has been crossed in recent decades by hostile tanks or helicopters as part of a coordinated military force.
Yost’s office didn’t respond when asked if he was worried that such inflammatory rhetoric would result in another racist massacre like the one that happened in 2019. Spun up on racist rhetoric, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, drove 600 miles from the Dallas area to an El Paso Walmart and started shooting every Hispanic-looking person he saw. In a manifesto he posted just before he murdered 23 and wounded 22, he wrote, “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
Prendergast said the friend-of-the-court brief the Ohio attorney general joined isn’t a serious legal effort — it’s just more toxic politics.
“I don’t think most people take it seriously,” she said. “It’s a chaos agent, meant to create fear and division.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As the spring earth thaws and rains drench New Hampshire, our infamous mud season has arrived. And, blowing in like a lion along with it is Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose mission includes defunding essential environmental agencies.
Federal funding has been frozen for New Hampshire farmers’ U.S. Department of Agriculture grants, like the rural energy programs designed to support farmers making efficiency improvements. Other programs that provide technical and financial assistance to those who prioritize soil health, wildlife habitat, and water and air quality in their agricultural practices or are transitioning to renewable energy systems are also facing stalled funding.
The New Hampshire Food Bank recently lost nearly $1 million in federal funding for its NH Feeding NH program, which purchases fresh produce in bulk from local farmers and assists partner agencies with buying culturally preferred foods for New Americans.
The U.S. House has also proposed $12 billion in cuts to school meal programs, affecting 12 million students in 24,000 schools nationwide. As Dorothy McAuliffe, the former first lady of Virginia, once lamented, “Kids can’t be hungry for knowledge if they’re just plain hungry.”
Drastic cuts in EPA funding have escalated the “forever chemical” crisis. Mark Ruffalo, actor and activist, has pleaded with Congress to stop PFAS at the source, knowing that exposure to the forever chemicals has been linked to health risks such as cancer, birth defects, reproductive and developmental disorders, and weakened immune systems.
In his testimony he cites Manchester as an example “where a wastewater treatment plant burns sewage sludge just steps from homes, an elementary school, a baseball field, and the Merrimack River.” This plant, he said, “is the only facility in the state with a sludge incinerator, and in 2018 alone, it burned more than 4,000 dry metric tons of it. That’s happening just two miles from neighborhoods already struggling with high levels of toxic air pollution.”
Ruffalo points to the solution: a Clean Water Act permit protecting waters from pollution,  specifically, renewing Manchester’s permit with stronger regulations to curb PFAS from entering the wastewater facility from upstream industries. Remarkably, Ruffalo notes, the current draft permit contains no such requirement. After “treatment” this toxic stew is spread as fertilizer over farmers’ fields where it leaches into the groundwater supply.
Pristine waterways will undoubtedly suffer severe environmental degradation as wetlands eventually lose their primary function to purify water, prevent flooding, and protect critical wildlife habitat. The EPA is currently ordered to scale back wetland regulations and oversight in favor of state and industry control. Tom Irwin of the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) warns that newly filed bills in the New Hampshire Legislature supported by the fossil fuel industry would, if passed, greatly weaken renewable energy programs by boosting oil and gas production over solar and wind energy.
A recent “Saturday Night Live” spoof featured the character Debbie Downer complaining to actor Robert De Niro that “we’re all walking landfills.” De Niro replied that the world “is like living in a full diaper.” In the soil of this morass we’re growing “natural” seeds coated with EPA approved radioactive waste. Despite these odds a unique seed variety persists, immutable and treatment resistant, one honored by the contemporary poet Dinos Christianopoulos in his couplet, “what didn’t you do to bury me / but you forgot that I was a seed.”
His acknowledgement of resilience and resistance serves as a call to action. Just like borrowing a book, you can sign out seeds for your garden from your local library or join the Surfrider Foundation’s cleanups of New Hampshire beaches or become a citizen scientist conducting water monitoring tests for the Nashua River Watershed Association. You can join Sy Montgomery’s team of turtle rescuers and rehabilitators described in her book “Of Time and Turtles: Mending the World, Shell by Shattered Shell.”
You can even volunteer with UNH’s rescue program, Nature Groupie. As thousands of amphibians migrate each spring to vernal pools and other wetlands to breed, the group organizes salamander crossing brigades at amphibian road crossings to help move them by hand (and keep count) during one or more “Big Nights.”
Saving small creatures brings the following parable inspired by Loren Eiseley to mind. A man walking along a beach noticed a boy picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean. When asked what he was doing, the boy replied, “Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The tide is going out and if I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.” The man replied, “Son, don’t you realize there’s miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish. You can’t possibly make a difference.” Bending down to throw another starfish into the surf, the boy said with a smile, “I made a difference for that one.”
Though we’re facing the erosion of environmental safeguards due to funding freezes, there are many ways we can remain steadfast, connected, and involved.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/elonmuskannp-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-04-01 04:59:38.706526

Local and state organizations such as the United Way of Central Ohio, Integrated Services for Behavioral Health, The Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Ohio, the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development, the Ohio Urban Community Action Network, and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio signed a letter asking that an expansion to publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program be maintained, and for the child tax credit to move along with other measures to help Ohioans pay for and support their children.
Dozens of individuals also signed the letter, including Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley, a former Ohio lawmaker herself.
“These proposals from Governor (Mike) DeWine represent a critical step toward making life more affordable for families, and ensuring children have a strong start to life,” Crawley wrote in a statement announcing the letter. “And make no mistake, it will be good for businesses and our economy as well.”
The commissioner said there is a “direct link” between a productive workforce and affordable quality child care, care that is “out of reach for far too many families in our state.”
Danielle Sydnor, CEO of the RISE Together Innovation Institute, a group which signed the letter, opined about the struggles of Ohio families who are fighting just to afford “basic necessities like housing, child care and groceries.”
“We stand in coalition to show overwhelming support to lower the cost of child care and to provide tax relief for working families,” Sydnor wrote in a statement. “Together, we urge lawmakers to prioritize relief for families in state budget negotiations.”

The letter was centered around organizations and individuals in Franklin County, pleading with state legislators to consider the “future priorities of Central Ohio and our state.”
“Housing and child care costs have surged, wages haven’t kept pace, and too many working people find themselves forced to make impossible choices between rent, child care, health care, and groceries,” according to the letter.
The proposed child tax credit, which would give a maximum of $1,000 per child ages 0 to 6, would allow for financial relief, the groups and individuals who signed the letter said.
Along with that, expansions to child care in the state to bring the eligibility of both publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program to 200% of the federal poverty line would “make life a little more affordable for working families.”
“The choices you and your colleagues make in this budget will shape the future of our region and our state,” the letter stated. “We urge you to stand with the people in Franklin County and across Ohio by passing a budget that provides some relief to families with young children.”
The letter cited recent research by child advocacy group (and letter supporter) Groundwork Ohio, who found in a poll of parents that 94% saw remedies to inflation and the cost of living as important concerns, and 84% of parents wanted to see reductions in the cost of child care.
A separate analysis of the child tax credit done in February by Scioto Analysis found that the tax credit, which would be paid for using an increase in the state tobacco tax, would benefit the state economy to the tune of more than $700 million.
Proposed Ohio child tax credit would produce $740M benefit to state economy, analysis finds

Democrats in the Ohio legislature are supportive of the tax credit (and think child care should be a priority), while Republicans have expressed hesitation in moving forward with the plan. Senate President Rob McColley seemed cautious when discussing raising taxes on cigarettes, saying it will be “a declining source of revenue.”
If passed, it could be the first time a GOP-controlled state implemented such a child tax credit, with Indiana also considering such a move.
On the side of child care, Republicans seemed to be more on board with the idea of improvements. Legislation to improve the child care sector has been introduced from both sides of the aisle, with the support of not only child care advocates but business groups and economic experts as well.
A bill to establish a cost-sharing model for child care called the Child Care Cred Program drew supporters to a House committee hearing on the bill this month. Businesses and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce urged support for the bill to help lift the parental load but also give the state workforce a boost. T
he legislation, and its companion bill in the Ohio Senate, are both led by GOP sponsors, making them more likely to succeed in a General Assembly over which Republicans hold a supermajority.

(Photo from Google Maps.)Ohio lawmakers plan to repeal the remaining aspects of scandal-tainted legislation, saving ratepayers money and eliminating FirstEnergy’s House Bill 6. As this happens, the utility company wants to increase consumers’ bills.
Like clockwork, energy costs go up in the winter.
“It’s been a long winter for us here in Ohio,” Clevelander John Makley said.
With a shaky economy and increasing FirstEnergy bills, Makley worries about his retirement.
“Do I have to manage to get to work and walk with a cane or a walker just to maintain a paycheck?” he asked.
FirstEnergy is now asking for even more money from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for a $190 million increase in their charges.
“Instead of a $190 million distribution rate increase, the FirstEnergy utilities should be getting a haircut,” Agency Director of the Office of Consumers’ Counsel (OCC) Maureen Willis said. “Consumers electric utility bills are already packed with soaring transmission costs and rising energy prices. Affordability remains a key issue for Ohio families and businesses.”
The OCC estimates that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison a $1.50 increase.
Makley is already frustrated by his current energy bill.
Taking a look at his charges, in the fine print, there is a subsidy that requires ratepayers to fund two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.
But thanks to the lawmakers, his energy costs may go down soon.
“They’re thinking about the people and working to right a wrong that was put into the legislation so long ago,” Makley said.
To find out which rider (a utility surcharge) on his bill benefited the plants — since it wasn’t on the bill — we had to search through the 150-page document on FirstEnergy’s website about tariffs.
Still, there was no mention of OVEC under any of the riders. We reached out to the company to find out where it was — turns out it falls under a rider on page 146 with the “Legacy Generation Resource Rider.”
This handout was part of House Bill 6, corrupt legislation that landed former House Speaker Larry Householder in federal prison for 20 years.
How we got here
Back in 2019, Householder funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give FirstEnergy a $1.3 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty. Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused of bribery, died by suicide after pleading not guilty in 2021.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years. Two defendants — Jeff Longstreth and Juan Cespedes — took plea agreements early on, helping the FBI, and are still awaiting their sentencing. The feds are asking for zero to six months for them.
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, former FirstEnergy Senior Vice President Michael Dowling, and former PUCO Sam Randazzo were all hit with state bribery charges. Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment in mid-February 2024. They are accused of masterminding the corruption scheme.
In April 2024, Randazzo would become the second defendant accused in the scandal to die by suicide.
Recently, Householder’s attorney said his team plans to use their connection to President Donald Trump to try to get out of prison.
OVEC
This past month, the Ohio House passed H.B. 15, and the Senate passed S.B. 2 — similar energy bills — but both repealed the subsidies for the unprofitable plants.
“If we leave this OVEC portion in place, it’s going to cost our taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars for a bill that was bought and paid for in the largest scandal in Ohio history,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.
You would be saving $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on your utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.
While the bill was passed overwhelmingly in each chamber, former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, argued that it could cause people to lose jobs if the plants shut down.
“There are Ohioans who work at this plant for generations — their grandfathers worked there,” Stephens said.
The Ohio plant is in Stephens’s district, and the former leader prevented similar legislation from being heard in the last General Assembly.
He explained that in a previous G.A., part of H.B. 6 was repealed, but the lawmakers chose to keep the coal plant money. Then, in the 134th G.A., lawmakers passed H.B. 128 — which took out funding for nuclear power plants.
House Speaker Matt Huffman didn’t seem impressed by Stephens’s remarks.
“This money doesn’t go to Lawrence County to help that plant,” the speaker told reporters after the vote. “It goes in Duke’s checking account in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they decide over many states, not necessarily to spend any money.”
Only three lawmakers voted against it in the House — Stephens and state Reps. Don Jones, R-Freeport, and Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus.
“I understand and respect your — the corruption that everyone wants to attach to House Bill 6,” Jones said. “I was here for House Bill 6 — it’s the lens in which you look at it through.”
He continued that his county has about 700 coal miners who rely on these plants.
“When Ohio makes a promise, whether we like the promise or not… We should honor that,” Stephens added.
“At whose expense?” Makley responded.
OVEC and the utility companies are lobbying for at least some grace period — a sliding ramp of two years for them to eliminate the subsidies.
“Ohio Valley Electric Company power plants have provided Ohioans with reliable power, helped make Ohio’s economic development possible and supported our nation’s security interests,” Scott Blake with OVEC and AEP said. “We continue to advocate for a reasonable timeline for transitioning the cost recovery for the OVEC plants and will work with policy makers as the legislative process continues.”
There is still a process before you could see your bills go down. Each chamber will have to agree on one policy, which is then sent to the governor.
Gov. Mike DeWine in January said, when asked, that he would support repeal.
Asked what it would take to earn his trust back on energy policy in Ohio, Makley said that’s a tough one.
“Transparency is really important,” he said. “We need to see what we’re paying for.”
The lawmakers who support it say they are hoping to close this dark chapter in state history.

(Getty Images)Millions of individuals in this country rely on Medicaid. Poor Medicaid: To me Medicaid is like a person who gets beat up on all the time. No one quite understands what to do with Medicaid, or what rules or laws to implement with it.
Hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments, and so do nursing homes. Doctors’ offices and mental health clinics such as Valeo rely on Medicaid as well. When Medicaid was privatized in Kansas and became known as KanCare, put into three for-profit companies, problems abounded. It became especially problematic for those with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
Now, in the U.S. Congress, there is debate about changes and cuts to Medicaid. It’s all very confusing, but the bottom line is all of it would harm the Medicaid program. The people who rely on Medicaid are not criminals. They are not entitled and trying to get something for nothing. These are people who truly can’t work and who may need Medicaid for the remainder of their lives.
With Medicaid, people can thrive in their communities and receive lifesaving care and support. Do we care about these folks? Do we care about preserving our hospitals like K.U. Medical Center and the nursing homes where our loved ones reside? Whenever I think of asking tough questions, I always go back to my own faith and ask the question: “What Would Jesus Do?”
Indeed, now is the time for Congress to ask this question and to search deep within their hearts for the answers to all of these pressing issues.
Valeo Behavioral Health Care has faced budget cuts due to changes and cuts in Medicaid funding. They work with the three managed care companies administering KanCare, and it has been and continues to be a tremendous challenge.
Families know what is best for their children. It’s easy to say, “Let’s have cuts and harmful cuts to Medicaid,” when one doesn’t have a disabled family member or friend or anyone they know who relies on Medicaid. Disabilities are not the enemy. Poverty shouldn’t be the enemy.
I think a lot of people are afraid of the needs of others. They feel overwhelmed and burdened by what they don’t understand. Let’s imagine if Jesus walked into the U.S. Congress and sat down with all the lawmakers. What would He say to them? Who would He advocate for?
Families are crying out for help and greater funding of Medicaid and not greater burdens. Let’s listen to their cries and not turn away. Let’s not create burdens for people who are already about to give up.
When I see people in need, I often feel overwhelmed, but I don’t ignore that person. Instead, I ask my deep faith what to do. My grandpa, who was a minister for 60 years, used to always end his phone calls with me by saying kindly: “Rebecca, stay on the road.”
With all the drama and trauma going on these days, I would implore Congressional leaders to not ignore these families with loved ones who need Medicaid. I would encourage them to imagine stepping into my grandpa’s summer kitchen — in the back of his old, huge, historic home in Americus, Georgia — and listen to him encourage them to stay on the road, to stick to their values no matter what.
Let’s not give up on the right thing to do. Let’s reach out during this time and dare to care. It’s the only thing to do.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Last fall, heading into the final stretch of a uniquely traumatizing presidential election year, I worried about us. I feared we were adapting to abnormal, becoming desensitized to appalling and shrugging off horrific. 
Like the metaphorical frogs in a pot of water on slow boil, we were simmering in the surreal, lulled into complacency as a coping mechanism. Now we’re sitting in a fully boiling cauldron clamped shut and I worry that the speed and scale of our impending fate doesn’t even register with many of us.
Democracy in Ohio is being boiled away by corruption, extremism, and attacks on voters

But there’s still time to escape the intense autocratic heat in America and reclaim our sovereignty. The first step to saving our right to self-determination is awareness. The authoritarian regime in Washington mirrors the authoritarian regime in Ohio. One-party rule in our state government ignores court orders, voter mandates and overwhelming public opposition to muddled, catastrophic policy. 
In our federal government, a convicted felon seizing unilateral control of everything under compliant one-party rule, ignores court orders on due process, congressional mandates and immense public outcry over reckless agency shutdowns, blanket firings, and unchecked data mining by an unelected billionaire.   
The DeWine administration replicated the bullying and financial extortion of universities and colleges in the Trump administration to crush academic independence and chill speech. 
Ohio’s profile-in-cowardice governor even mimicked Trump’s performative signings of executive orders by posing with his own signature on ruinous state legislation designed to own the libs and teach “woke” public universities and colleges a right-wing lesson on cancel culture and funding cuts.
When Gov. Mike DeWine made the fiercely opposed Ohio Senate Bill 1 law — prohibiting all diversity, equity and inclusion activities on campus and setting regulations around “controversial” issues — he also sanctioned SB1’s anti-union edict to rescind certain collective bargaining rights and tenure protections for faculty no longer allowed to strike. 
The state’s union-busting rule followed Trump’s executive order that abolished union rights at over two dozen federal agencies.
As the powerbrokers in Columbus and Washington sync their agendas to control and subjugate, they are laser focused on removing whatever stands in their way — chiefly, free, fair and accessible elections. 
Undermining them is a coordinated MAGA goal of the utmost priority before the 2026 midterms. To that end, Trump recently issued a sweeping executive order dictating the law of the land on federal elections — which he has no constitutional authority to do — that could stop millions of Americans from registering to vote in federal elections if they don’t have proof of citizenship (which many don’t or can’t easily access). 
Voters already attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. The added hurdle is purely to suppress votes, especially those that trend Democratic.
Trump’s directive severely limits voting by mail and gives more uncurbed power to Elon Musk’s DOGE to comb through sensitive state voter files. What could go wrong? 
Unrestrained voter purges. Database errors. Leaks. It’s all good if it keeps voters from holding unlawful leaders to account. 
Trump’s allies in Congress have teed up a nearly identical voter suppression scheme called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.
It could block more than 21 million eligible Americans from voting because they’re unable to supply a birth certificate or passport or enhanced driver’s license or jump through more gratuitous GOP hoops for permission to vote.

U.S. House Republicans are expected to consider their massive barrier to voting this week. It would require everyone registering to vote or updating their registration to prove their citizenship. Mail, online, and voter registration drives would be functionally eliminated because of the new, in-person, show-us-your-papers requirements.
This is a full court press by GOP lawmakers on the federal and state level to stay in power by disenfranchising active voters with the Trumpian-fueled myth of rampant voter fraud. 
Ohio Republicans are quietly rolling out legislation now that would also reduce participation at the polls. As always, they justify their so-called anti-fraud measures as election “integrity” insurance — even as they boast of our “gold standard” election system and can’t produce evidence of a problem. Ever. 
A bill was just introduced in the Ohio Senate (SB 153) that would require proof of citizenship to vote in the state and ban ballot drop boxes altogether because why not?
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, obsessed with dreaming up new ways to solve a phantom dilemma (a post-election audit last November showed a perfect accuracy rate and no voter fraud in the presidential race in Ohio) touted SB 153 as “a simple fix that strengthens trust and integrity in our institutions.” 
She posted her enthusiasm for Trump’s sham executive order that attacks free and fair elections. “President Trump is right; we need to do everything to protect the integrity of our elections.” 
Poor thing must have amnesia about Trump’s lawless attempt to overturn a free and fair election, his blatant lies about a stolen election that wasn’t, and his incitement of a violent attack on the seat of our democracy to stay in power. 
We are in boiling hot water. The only way out is with eyes wide open. Then you have to decide whether you care enough to exercise your fundamental rights with resolve and not a minute to spare.

These states want to make oil companies pay.,Alex Brown,,,,,https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/briefs/climate-disasters-are-on-the-rise-these-states-want-to-make-oil-companies-pay/,"For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.

“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

But that would change under a bill that is now sitting on Gov. Brian [&#8230;],"This undated photo shows the death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, Ga. Photo by Georgia Department of Corrections/Getty ImagesGeorgia is the only state with the death penalty that requires defendants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are intellectually disabled to be spared execution – a high legal standard that no one charged with intentional murder has cleared.
But that would change under a bill that is now sitting on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk that would lower the standard of proof. 
Advocates have pushed for the change for two decades, but a south Georgia lawmaker, Glennville Republican state Rep. Bill Werkheiser, was able to convince his colleagues that the state’s law was incompatible with the constitution’s prohibition against executing people who are intellectually disabled.
Werkheiser often pointed to a 2021 Georgia Supreme Court case where a judge wrote in a dissenting opinion that using the highest possible burden of proof increases the risk that someone with an intellectual disability is executed.
House Bill 123 lowers the standard of proof for proving someone has an intellectual disability to a preponderance of the evidence, ending Georgia’s outlier status as the only state that requires beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The measure also creates a pre-trial hearing where a judge would focus only on the question of whether the defendant is intellectually disabled. Today, a jury is determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled at the same time they are hearing grisly details about the alleged crime and deciding the person’s guilt or innocence.
The bill was changed in the Senate to require 60 days of information sharing between the prosecution and defense before the newly created pretrial hearing. Prosecutors had fought the pretrial hearing, arguing it was adding another step in an already lengthy legal process.
And it also now requires defendants who prove they are intellectually disabled but are found guilty will be sentenced to life in prison or life without the possibility of parole. Defense attorneys and others opposed adding life without the possibility of parole as an option. 
“A life sentence in Georgia must be served for a minimum 30 years before a person can even be considered for parole, and that’s considered, not necessarily released,” Mazie Lynn Guertin, executive director and policy advocate with the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said to lawmakers last month.
The bill sailed through the Senate Monday and was finalized by the end of the day in the House. The proposal also drew support from Catholic groups and a tag-team advocacy effort from the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. 
The Southern Center for Human Rights, which has long advocated for changes to Georgia’s law, celebrated the bill’s passage Monday and is already planning the party. 
“This change will put Georgia in line with twenty-six other states that have protections for people with intellectual disability,” said Terrica Redfield Ganzy, the center’s executive director. “We are deeply grateful to Chairman Werkheiser for his compassion and leadership on this issue. It is our honor to partner with him on this effort.”
Werkheiser, who chairs the House Industry and Labor Committee, has developed a special interest in the state’s prison system and the people involved in it, recently visiting all the state’s prisons. He sponsored a version of the bill last year that went nowhere and spent the last year working to work through reservations about the changes. 
He thanked House leadership and the lawmakers in the committees who spent time this session getting the bill done.
“There were so many advocacy groups that joined along the way that were not only encouraging, but provided assistance in so many ways. It was a team effort from so many,” Werkheiser said Monday.

Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) points to the disparity in the coach-to-teacher ratio between school systems as proof that it is.","Sen. Ron Waston (D-Prince George's) served as the floor leader Monday for the bill to alter the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's sweeping education reform plan. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)For anyone thinking the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is no longer needed, Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) points to the disparity in the coach-to-teacher ratio between school systems as proof that it is.
Where Baltimore City has 43 teachers for every one instructional coach in the school system, for example, Baltimore County’s rate is 68 to 1, while Prince George’s County ratio of teachers to coaches is a staggering 276 to one.
“That should tell you something,” Watson said during Senate debate Monday. “There is a significant disparity about the equitable distribution” of coaches in the state.
His comments came as the full Senate debated the Blueprint, the state’s 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform effort now in is third year. The Senate gave preliminary approval to its version of the plan Monday, after rejecting a series of Republican amendments to the bill during about 30 minutes of debate.
The Senate also advanced the House version of the bill, which it amended to make identical to its own — changes the House is likely to reject, setting the stage for a conference committee later this week to work out differences before the session ends Monday.
The House approved its version of the Blueprint reform bill earlier this month, rejecting cuts in per pupil funding and a four-year pause on teacher collaborative time, both elements of the bill proposed by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Senate Bill 429, and the conformed House version, agrees with the governor on the collaborative time and per pupil funding provisions.
Like the House, which rejected Republican amendments to the bill in a vote earlier this month, the Senate on Monday also rejected amendments from three GOP lawmakers.
Tbe House amendments were all rejected on a roll call, but in the Senate on Monday, the first two Republicans’ amendments were rejected with a loud “No!” by some Democrats that cascaded throughout the chamber.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) offered slightly more than three pages of amendments that included a freeze for all increases of per pupil funding, and for the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) to develop metrics to measure student outcomes directly related to programs in the Blueprint. The AIB is charged with overseeing the multiyear school reform plan.

Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) introduced two amendments, which were similar to those she presented unsuccessfully last week before her Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee.
Her amendments would have required the state Department of Education, in collaboration with the AIB, to convene “a certain” work group to study the long-term sustainability of the Blueprint. She also proposed the department and AIB convene a work group to not only study the Blueprint “based on its mandates and costs,” but also analyze overall public school funding on items such as health services, school security and transportation.
Sen. Jason Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil) sought to eliminate a new Academic Excellence Program, which was first presented by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in the bill known as the “Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act.”
The estimated $17 million program for next fiscal year includes the hiring of instructional coaches, who would work with teachers and administrations at schools with low-proficiency rates and declining achievement results in recent years.
Education officials told the Education, Energy and Environment Committee last week that up to 200 coaches would be needed in the next five years. The state currently has about 800, but 63% of them are in only five of the state’s 24 school systems.
“I think that’s not fiscally responsible,” said Gallion, who serves on that committee. “It was brought out that these coaches would make, like, $120,000 each. By my quick math, that would be two teachers for every coach that we could pay for by this funding.”
But Watson, who served as the floor leader on the bill, summarized the coach-to-teacher ratio in five counties:

 54 teachers to one coach in Anne Arundel;
43-to-1 in Baltimore City;
68-to-1 in Baltimore County;
79-to-1 in Montgomery; and
276-to-1 in Prince George’s County.

“The AIB is going to continue to make these decisions to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of these things that are going to close the achievement gap and help all of our students achieve,” he said.
The House and Senate will need to agree and pass identical bills by Monday, the last day of the legislative session.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-Ron-Watson-3-31-2025-scaled-light-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-04-01 04:59:38.706526

Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Senate Republicans scored a victory in Monday’s budget debate, winning an amendment that dedicates a new per tire fee to state highways and bridges.
It was a rare win for the minority party in floor debate, as the Senate gave preliminary approval to a $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 that includes a tax and fee package that will raise and estimated $1 billion.
While Republicans protested the new tire fee — $5 per tire — they were able to convince Democrats to dedicate the money specifically to state highway projects instead of the Transportation Trust Fund, which goes to transit as well as roads.
  Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“I think that was an amendment that did make a lot of sense,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “You know, the $5 tire tax is new. They talked about it going to the Transportation Trust Fund. We just wanted to make sure that it actually goes to roads and bridges.”
On Monday night, Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) stepped in before the amendment could be rejected by budget subcommittee leaders.
“I can see the nexus on this one, so I’m going to suggest we support this one,” Guzzone said, as he quickly called for a roll call vote.
Republicans in the House proposed nearly two dozen budget amendments during debate last week, none of which passed. Senate Republicans offered about half that number of amendments Monday.
Hershey said he couldn’t remember the last time a Republican amendment was adopted. He chalked it up to the differences between the House and Senate and, in part, to Senate Republicans voting for the budget in each of the last 10 years, including two under Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“So when you talk about it from that perspective, you know, eight years of Gov. [Larry] Hogan, the first two with Gov. Moore, when we were in a better fiscal climate, I think we respected the budget process, and because it didn’t have the tax increases associated with them, I mean, you saw the amount of amendments that we had, and the vote count was probably not what people would have expected.”
Hershey also noted that some Democrats — from what would be considered more purple districts — joined Republicans on a number of amendments. Included on that list were Anne Arundel County Democratic Sens. Dawn Gile and Shaneka Henson, Katie Hester Fry (D-Montgomery and Howard), Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Mary-Dulany James (Harford).
The Senate could take up a final vote on the two-bill budget package as early as Tuesday. From there, it will head to a conference committee where the House and Senate will hammer out a final agreement.
There’s no guarantee the Senate Republican amendment will survive conference committee.
“That’s the tough part,” said Hershey.”It’s easy sometimes to get an amendment — not easy to get an amendment passed, but sometimes you get an amendment passed here, and it still has to survive that.”
Hershey said he was hopeful that since the tire fee originated in the Senate, as did the Republican amendment, that the Senate would have to ability to retain the dedicated funding.

It’s part of an amended budget that Guzzone said erases a $3 billion projected structural deficit for the coming year. He said it also reduces a similar sized deficit projected for fiscal 2027 to just $300 million.
“This is really, in my opinion, all about the structural flow for the future. That’s what this budget is defined by,” Guzzone said.
Guzzone added that “that the impact of what we have done today, or what we will do today, will have a lasting effect, not just for (fiscal) ’26 but clearly in (fiscal) ’27 in a big way.”
The expectation is that the two chambers will make short work of a conference committee agreement. The House and Senate reached agreement on the vast majority of issues two weeks ago.
Some of that agreement was on an end result, even if the two chambers disagreed on the path. The tire fee is an example.
The House and Senate broadly agreed to the need for about $420 million in additional funding for the flagging Transportation Trust Fund.
The House plan called for increasing the sales tax on car sales from 6% to 6.8%.
The Senate instead called for a 6.5% car sales tax, phased in over two years, with the tax rising to 6.35% in the first year. The it added the $5 per tire fee, which would be on top of the 6% sales tax and a $1 per tire recycling fee that goes to the state Department of the Environment.
The Senate on Monday also approved trigger provisions meant to adjust state spending if revenues decrease.
Of primary concern are ongoing reductions in federal agencies and employees and overall spending, as well as tariffs on products including vehicles that pass through the Port of Baltimore.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As part of that effort, the Senate replaced a proposed trigger tied to federal Medicaid reimbursements with one tied to overall federal aid. The amendment requires the Department of Budget and Management to track reductions in federal aid: When the amount reaches $1 billion, the department is to report to the legislature with plans for dealing with the reductions.
The amendment has a two-fold effect.
The first is to give lawmakers more input on budget actions during the interim, and it avoids immediate, direct cuts to Medicaid. Currently, the Board of Public Works can cut up to 25% of the budget without legislative approval.
Additionally, the monitoring and reporting requirement will help lawmakers better gauge when and if a special session is needed. Lawmakers, including Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) have said for weeks that a special session may be necessary in September or October as the federal budget year begins and the state gets updated revenue projections.
The Senate also added a number of provisions that would slow the pace of funding for the landmark Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms if revenues fall.
The first would slow funding if the Board of Revenue Estimates lowers revenue expectations at its December meeting by $850 million — roughly 3.75% — from its March projection.
Another comes if overall federal funding to the state decreases by $750 million.
If neither reaches their respective thresholds, funding could still slow down if revenue and federal funding drop by roughly $600 million combined.

Maryland has already seen a $300 million hit in education spending. Federal officials in a Friday evening letter notified the state it was pulling out the funding that the state had already spent. Guzzone said the money would likely have to be repaid in full if an attempt to seek a waiver fails.
The two chambers are also expected to add a second supplemental budget into the spending plan during the conference committee process. That supplemental from the governor is expected to contain nearly $100 million in additional spending reductions.
The Senate budget debate was faster than the House debate last week by nearly three hours. It was also, with an early exception, a more civil affair.
The debate appeared to be headed into heated partisan territory early, when Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) compared early GOP amendments to slash-and-burn reductions at the federal level.
“It’s very clear this is the down payment on the Musk-Trump administration agenda,” Rosapepe said, noting a Republican amendment went after state employees, education and health care.
“It’s clearly going to get worse in Washington, but I, for am, going to stand against the Musk-Trump administration and what they do nationally, and stand against the same policies here in Maryland,” Rosapepe said. “We need to fight back, not roll over.”
It was a moment that potentially could have sparked a bitter debate as happened in the House.

Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Lower Shore) questioned whether the debate conformed to the chamber’s rules of decorum.
“If I were to accuse someone of doing something for another reason, that’s impugning my motives,” Mautz said. “And I think that was sort of a statement that we just heard, and I was wondering if there was a rule about that.”
Ferguson, speaking from the rostrum, said he had not initially considered the comment in the same way Mautz described.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas Senate committee approved a bill Monday that would impose harsher penalties on undocumented migrants who commit “serious felony” crimes “involving violence” in the state.
But Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, primary sponsor of Senate Bill 426, or the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, will be considered a second time by the Senate Judiciary Committee after the Cave Springs Republican amended it later on Monday to change the schedule of penalties outlined in the bill.
Under the version of SB 426 that passed committee Monday, undocumented migrants with initial charges of Class Y felonies — the most serious — would have faced two to 10 extra years of prison time. Felony charges under the lower four classes would have been upgraded one class. Some felonies also are unclassified.
The amended bill would create the following penalties for people “illegally or unlawfully in the United States” at the time of an offense:

A person convicted of a Class D felony, or an unclassified felony with no more than six years of prison time, would get up to four years added to the sentence
A person convicted of a Class A, B or C felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence between six and 30 years, would get up to 10 years added to the sentence
A person convicted of a Class Y felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence of longer than 30 years or life, would get up to 20 years added to the sentence.


SB426-S2 
SB 426 includes a list of violent felonies that would precipitate enhanced penalties, including first-degree and second-degree murder, rape, arson, terroristic acts and threatening, first-degree battery and aggravated assault, among other things.
The bill would also mandate that Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal program that deputizes them to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
The 287(g) program, specifically the Warrant Service Officer Program, authorizes participating agencies to serve administrative warrants under federal immigration law.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas opposes the bill because it “would divert local resources from public safety to federal law enforcement” and “prevents cities and counties from determining what is best” for their residents, policy director Sarah Everett told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“We don’t feel that bills like this really do anything to help public safety,” said Everett, one of two people to speak against the bill. “I don’t think most people are doing a whole lot of math when they’re thinking about committing a crime. What we really need to be focusing on is preventing crime in the first place.”
 ‘All these gangs’

The sheriff’s offices in Craighead and Benton counties already have 287(g) cooperation agreements, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements webpage. U.S. House Republicans have been vocally supportive of the program.
Local law enforcement officers would not be required to participate in the program until after they have someone arrested and in custody, Hester said in response to questions from the committee.
“We do not want to make this a place where violent criminals come,” Hester said. “We do not want to be a place where we’re seeing all these gangs start to move to.”
President Donald Trump’s administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court last week to allow the deportations of Venezuelans accused of gang ties to continue. Cracking down on illegal immigration, including with “mass deportations,” was a primary talking point of Trump’s reelection campaign last year.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was Trump’s press secretary during part of his first term, held a press conference earlier this month expressing support for the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, which she previously named as a policy priority during her State of the State address.
The bill would also expand the state’s ban on sanctuary cities, which signify a lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and prohibit all local governments from adopting such policies, even in unincorporated areas. The state would withhold discretionary grants or other funds from any “local government that adopts or enacts a sanctuary policy” until the policy is repealed.
Similarly, Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20, his first day back in the White House, saying the federal government must withhold funds from sanctuary jurisdictions.
Sanctuary policies are largely symbolic and do not enable local officials to prevent ICE arrests, Stateline reported in February.
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed SB 426 with no audible dissent. The committee’s sole Democrat, Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock, was absent during the discussion and vote.
 Taxpayer money and due process

Increasing the length of criminals’ incarceration does not prevent crime, Everett said, and she questioned how much SB 426 would cost taxpayers since incarceration itself costs money.

The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on a $750 million appropriation to begin construction of a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County that has generated frustration from lawmakers and Arkansans. The Sanders administration has said the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails.
Everett said SB 426 will have “unintended consequences.” Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, said “not controlling the border” between the U.S. and Mexico also has “unintended consequences.”
No members of the public spoke for the bill. Besides Everett, the other opponent of SB 426 was criminal defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig, who said the bill lacks a strong enough definition of what makes an immigrant “illegal.”
The Trump administration has recently been canceling the visas and green cards of legal immigrants, Rosenzweig noted, and he said SB 426 could be improved by requiring authorities to provide notice to individuals whose legal status was revoked.
“You can be lawful one day and unlawful the next, depending on what some ICE agent or some Cabinet official or someone in between said,” Rosenzweig said.
He also noted that everyone on U.S. soil, not just U.S. citizens, is subject to due process and a jury trial if they face criminal charges.
Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, said he disagreed with Rosenzweig’s suggestion to add a notification requirement to SB 426.
“It’s their job [as immigrants] to know whether they’re here legally or not,” Johnson said.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday that, by July, his administration expects to have accomplished a goal it announced a year ago: elimination of a long-running “wait list” for Nebraskans seeking services for intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Last March, the list contained about 2,700 people, and a projected wait for available funds stretched for up to eight years. The governor said the number has been whittled to about 700.

“This is the first time in the last 35 years that this wait list is going to be eliminated,” Steve Corsi, chief executive officer of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said at a press conference in Omaha that also closed Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month.
Pillen, Corsi and Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, updated progress on cutting the wait, the public cost and what they’ve described as the state’s reimagining of how services are offered to Nebraskans with developmental disabilities.
 ‘Popped my top’

After a tour of the recently opened new headquarters for Madonna Ability Alliance, which helps support Nebraskans with disabilities, state officials answered questions from reporters and mingled with Madonna families and participants filling the lobby of the building near 72nd and Pine Streets in Omaha. 
Among the lineup of speakers was Blake Hodgen, a Madonna participant who stole the show by relaying his educational, music therapy and job-training experiences since second grade at Madonna, which he and others said helped prepare him for his long-time catering job with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Pillen told the group he took aim at shortening the list, known also as the Developmental Disabilities Registry, because it didn’t make sense. 
“You break the glass if that’s what you have to do,” Pillen said. “But when the most vulnerable Nebraskans’ needs weren’t being met for eight years, (it) popped my top off.”
Eliminating the wait list, Pillen said, requires a roughly $40 million annual investment, with the state footing about $19 million each year and federal funds covering the rest. He foresees Nebraska becoming a model for other states with long waits to access developmental disabilities services — though advocates say they see some flaws, and they are still evaluating the full impact of changes.
At one time, Green said, the Nebraska registry listed 4,500 names.
 More immediate support 

Clearing the wait, he said, means that all the families will have been offered at least some specialized support through a Medicaid waiver program that lets states to tap federal funding for accessing home- and community-based services intended to keep people out of institutions.

Key to the list shrinkage, said Green, is a new approach that “meets families where they’re at” — providing for a more immediate and targeted service, such as funding for child or respite care or vehicle modification. Family advocates have said a family support waiver was created, for instance, as an intermediary solution that provides up to $10,000 a year for such services.
In the old system, Green said a family would put their name on the registry and wait as long as eight years to get what is known as a “comprehensive” developmental waiver — which is more costly but provides access to a wider array of services, including full-time residential services outside the home, particularly for adults. 
Green said not all families require such a gamut, and state officials believe that the overall needs of the population are better met by providing more narrow services closer to when a family needs them. 
Also new and crucial, he and advocates said, is that the state now allows youths with disabilities access to medical care through Medicaid — even if their household income is beyond typical Medicaid limits.
Said Green: “What we’re working on now is a system that says, ‘What’s your need that’s being unmet?’ And we’ll figure out which waiver has the right service and supports for you. I would say it’s a continuum of care … It will be individualized to the family and child.”
 ‘Misses the mark’

Edison McDonald is executive director of The Arc of Nebraska, the state’s largest membership organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. He said the state’s new approach takes positive steps, including the Medicaid expansion that helps ensure that kids with developmental disabilities get access to health care.

However, he cited drawbacks. For example, he said, the often lengthy wait used to be a pathway to guaranteed access to comprehensive services including the out-of-home residential services. That is no longer the case, McDonald said. 
“They call it innovation when really it is barring a lot of people from that access to residential services. In some cases, it misses the mark and can potentially be harmful,” he said.
McDonald said the comprehensive service option is still available, but for adults with the highest needs such as being homeless or being a danger to themself. He said advocates are still trying to grasp the breadth of the impact the changes will bring. 











In some cases, it misses the mark and can be potentially harmful.

McDonald said what advocates thought was an “intermediary” solution — the family support waiver offering up to $10,000 of services annually — appears possibly to be more of a “destination.” He also said the state’s system includes what advocates view as an outdated rate schedule for service providers.
Alana Schriver, executive director of Nebraska Association of Service Providers, applauded the Pillen administration’s commitment overall. But she worries about the state rates allowed for service providers. Without better wages for more workers, she said, “this whole conversation is moot.”
“If there is nobody to serve the people, what are we doing?”

Board of Education President Joshua Michale, left, listens. (File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Education told states Friday that it was canceling previous approvals to spend down remaining COVID-19 recovery funds, a change that could mean $418 million to the Maryland Department of Education.
The change was announced in a letter from U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was dated Friday at 5 p.m., and said the decision to cancel the pandemic funding was effective — Friday at 5 p.m.
“Shock does not begin to describe our reaction when we received the notification late Friday evening,” Maryland State Superintendent Carey Wright said Monday. “This jeopardizes over $400 million in funding.”
Wright called the federal agency’s decision “catastrophic,” nothing that the money has already been spent or at least committed to the state’s 24 school systems. She said the money is being used for tutoring, reading materials, after-school programming, even some construction projects such as repairs for heating and air conditioning units, among others.
State officials said about $305.2 million has already been spent but not reimbursed by the federal department. Another $112.8 million is in “encumbered” funds not paid out by the state, which means school systems must immediately stop any ongoing work on capital projects, or educational programs.
“It may be a tutoring program that’s going on right now in schools that was intended to go through this school year, or it might be an improvement to a health room in a school,” said state Board of Education President Joshua Michael. “There’s going to be significant disruption.”
$7 million payment to substitute among issues in Prince George’s schools audit

Officials said it remains unclear if the state would need to cover costs for ongoing programs, or if the local school systems may have to return any money already spent.
“The federal government is breaking the trust that it has once held strong with states across America,” Michael said.
School officials said they are consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on the possibility of filing suit against the federal department.
“I think it’s fair to say that we are exploring all legal options at this time given the severity of this action,” Michael said.
He said the majority of the money comes from the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.
The state last year requested and received approval for an extension on how it would draw down the ESSER funds it  had left over. Wright said the state sought extensions because of supply chain issues and construction delays.
The approval was given before a Jan. 28 deadline set by former President Joe Biden (D) before he left office that month. But in her letter Friday, McMahon dismissed the approvals by the previous administration.
“The extension approval was issued recently, so any reliance interests developed are minimal,” McMahon wrote. “Moreover, an agency may reconsider its prior decision. So you could not rely on the Department adhering to its original decision. That is especially true because the extension was a matter of administrative grace.”
She said that extending deadlines to allocate “COVID-related grants … years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion.”
But McMahon also wrote the department would reconsider funding for states if the could explain “how a particular project’s extension is necessary to mitigate the effects of COVID on American students’ education, and why the Department should exercise its discretion to grant your request.”
Wright said ending the program at 5 p.m. Friday and offering to consider appeals from states “seemed to be contradictory,” but she said her department plans to send a letter to justify why money for Maryland is necessary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A U.S. department spokesperson said that specific projects would be assessed if funds are used directly to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.
“COVID is over. States and school districts can no longer claim they are spending their emergency pandemic funds on ‘COVID relief’ when there are numerous documented examples of misuse,” said Madi Biedermann in a statement Monday afternoon.
“The Biden Administration established an irresponsible precedent by extending the deadline for spending the COVID money far beyond the intended purpose of the funds, and it is past time for the money to be returned to the people’s bank account,” Biedermann’s statement said.
In part because of the Education Department’s decision, the Maryland Senate approved an amendment to a budget bill Monday that would require the governor’s budget team to track federal cuts and, if they hit $1 billion, recommend state spending cuts to the General Assembly’s Legislative Policy Committee.
“If we have a $1 billion problem from combined actions by the federal government, we would begin a process of review through our policy committee, and work with the governor to come up with solutions,” said Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), chair of the Budget and Taxation Committee. “We have to be wide-eyed open about what could be happening because it is happening.”
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) asked if any recommendations that may come from the policy committee would be for the legislature next year.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Susan Baxter is the latest in a series on Act 77, which gave voters the option of voting by mail without an excuse for not going to the polls in person for the first time in 2020. It’s also the second time Baxer has found the law impermissibly disenfranchises voters.
People who choose to vote by mail are required to complete a declaration including the date on the outside of the envelope provided to return their ballots. But voters often forget the date or write a date unrelated to the election, such as their birthdate. Such mistakes have caused tens of thousands of ballots to be disqualified even when they’re returned on time. They often form the basis to challenge mail ballots in close elections.
In a lawsuit by the national Democratic congressional and senate campaign committees and the American Federation of Teachers against Pennsylvania’s 67 county boards of elections, Baxter found the requirement serves no compelling government interest and doesn’t justify infringing on voters’ First Amendment rights.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She found no evidence to support “nebulous” claims by Republican groups that intervened in the case that the date requirement bolsters voter confidence or preserves the solemnity of voting. While preventing voter fraud is less ambiguous, there’s also no evidence the date requirement serves that purpose, Baxter said.
“Since there is no evidence that the date requirement serves any state interest, even a slight burden on voting rights cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny,” she wrote. “Put another way, even the slightest burden that results from the enforcement of the date provision is too much when there is no counterbalance.”
Calls to attorneys for the Republican National Committee were not returned Monday. 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said the ruling was a “victory for free and fair elections, protecting Pennsylvanians’ constitutional right to participate in our democracy.”
“It’s also a reminder that while Republicans continue their efforts to disenfranchise voters across the country, Democrats are ready to fight everywhere to ensure every legal vote is counted,” Shelton said.
Last year, Baxter, who is a Trump appointee, ruled in a separate lawsuit the date requirement violated the Materiality Clause of the federal Civil Rights Act, which bans rules that prevent people from voting over meaningless errors on election paperwork. The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Baxter’s decision, finding the provision applies only when the state is determining who may vote and not to “rules, like the date requirement, that govern how a voter must cast his ballot for it to be counted.”
The date requirement has also been the subject of a web of state court decisions that have, so far, failed to resolve whether the rule violates the Pennsylvania Constitution. In a case last October, the state Supreme Court declined to rule on the issue with the Nov. 5 presidential election less than 30 days away,citing the risk of confusion a change in the rules might cause.
In each of the prior cases, the evidence established that counties stamp ballots with the date and time they are received to document that they arrived before the Election Day deadline.

In her decision, Baxter noted the right to free expression at issue was separate from the “core political speech” protected under the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court established a test to determine whether rules that infringe on political expression via the ballot are constitutional. That test balances whether the infringement is justified by an interest in orderly elections.
“The commonwealth has not identified what specific regulatory interest is furthered. Indeed, despite formal notification, the commonwealth has not defended the constitutionality of the dating requirement,” Baxter said, noting that most of the county boards of elections had not identified an interest in enforcing the date requirement.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The fallout from the Trump administration’s move to claw back about $11 billion in public health funding as part of federal budget cuts targeting COVID-19 response grants has hit Utah. 
Dozens of public health employees in Utah’s state and local health departments will lose their jobs after roughly $100 million in Utah grants were cut short — ending funding nearly two years earlier than expected. 
Last week, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services received “unexpected notification” from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that some COVID-related grants stemming from the American Rescue Plan Act had ended effective immediately, state health department officials said in a news release issued Friday. 
Across the Utah health department, six grants were cut short, totaling about $98 million that remained before the grant period that was supposed to have ended at the close of 2026. The grants, according to the department, funded “public health functions and behavioral health services.” 
Out of its roughly 6,000 employees, the Utah health department said it had 187 staff positions “funded partially or completely by the impacted funds.” Many of the positions were temporary, but on Friday state department officials announced more than three dozen state workers will lose their jobs. 
“Unfortunately, we had to announce today an early reduction of 37 staff in positions funded by these specific COVID-related grants,” the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said. “These staff positions will end April 11.”

Tracy Gruber, director of Utah’s health department, called those employees who were laid off “public health heroes.” 
“We are sorry to see these positions end early,” Gruber said in a statement. “We consider them all public health heroes, many of whom joined our department when we needed to ramp up operations to keep Utahns safe during the global pandemic. These staff came in to serve the public at an incredibly difficult time.” 
In an email sent to staff on Friday, department officials said the funds had allowed Utah to “perform critical functions during the pandemic, including purchasing vaccines, engaging in wastewater testing, and providing critical behavioral health services.” 
After the pandemic ended, the federal government extended the funds to “retain critical capacity in public health systems across the country and ameliorate the impacts of COVID-19,” the staff email continued. “Like other states, Utah continued utilizing these funds as we evaluated our long-term strategy to retain this critical capacity.” 
However, “the federal government terminated these funds early,” it continued. 
“This was not entirely unexpected, but the timing was,” state health department leaders said in the staff email. “The majority of this funding was set to be expended by the end of 2026 so the department was preparing for this funding to end.”
The “lack of warning” from the early cut off is “causing some challenges,” in the health department as it continues its work, the email said, “but we know the staff and our external partners bear the real stress and fear of the sudden decisions by our federal partners.”
“This sudden action is disappointing and not what we would expect from our partners,” the staff email added. 
State health officials added that in the days leading up to Friday’s announcement, they had been analyzing the impact and waiting to see if the decision would be reversed, but by the end of the week they said the funds were, in fact, being terminated. 
The state health department also warned that it continues to evaluate the impact of the cuts, and warned “it is possible we will need to make additional staff reductions. We anticipate making that decision in the very near future.” 
Impacts reach beyond COVID-19
When federal officials made the announcement last week, they characterized the grants as no longer needed and wasting taxpayer money.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, the Associated Press reported. 
Carrie Butler, executive director at the Utah Public Health Association, said the impacts of the federal funds ran far deeper than COVID-19 — they helped “strengthen the public health infrastructure workforce” after years of being underfunded. 
“That is something that is really important and critical for people to understand, that a majority of (Utah’s public health funding) comes from federal grant money,” Butler said. 
She said the federal cuts will impact Utah’s public health system as a whole, including programs focused on proactive or preventative health programs meant to help keep the state’s population healthy and “resilient” ahead of the next public health disaster. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“When the pandemic hit, it hit at a time when we were underfunded (for) disease mitigation,” or programs meant to reduce preventable health issues, she said. “Then when the pandemic hit and we got all of these extra ARPA funds, we were able to build back a little bit of our infrastructure.” 
From immunization programs, to diabetes prevention and smoking cessation, Butler said Utah was able to make progress to help make its population healthier, but now with those federal funds drying up early, she said those efforts will become more difficult. 
“While we knew (the funds) were temporary, we also had planned them all out to create and finish the programs and infrastructure,” she said. But now, “there’s a significant amount of sunk cost.”  
Butler said the Utah Public Health Association also had to lay off one employee that was working on building a community health worker certification process. She said that the program was slated to be finished by June. Now, she said “we are going to try our best” to use volunteer hours to finish the program on time. 
“We’re going to try to get it done,” she said. “We are used to being scrappy. But it also means there are a lot of gaps that wouldn’t otherwise exist if we were adequately funded.” 
Butler added that public health workers are also dealing with continued anxiety over what could come next — including the likelihood there are more federal funds on the chopping block. 
“We’re all a little bit nervous about what this means for future funding and for public health infrastructure,” she said. “By no stretch of the imagination do any of us think that this is the end of the cuts.” 
More laid off from local health departments 
At least 32 workers have been laid off from some of Utah’s 13 local health departments — most of which come from Utah’s most populated county. 
The biggest number will come from Salt Lake County, whose health department will lay off 17 employees in epidemiology, nursing, community health and communications workers, according to the department’s spokesperson Nic Rupp. 
“It’s a devastating blow to our workforce,” Rupp said, adding that the news left some in the county’s offices “in tears” last week. “It’s not just folks who are losing their jobs, although of course they are the most impacted. But it’s everyone around them. It’s a work family.” 


Local health department layoffs
Salt Lake County Health Department: 17
Bear River Health Department (Box Elder, Cache and Rich County): 5 
Southwest Utah Health Department (Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane, Washington counties): 5 
Southeast Utah Health Department (Carbon, Emery, Grand counties): 2
Tooele County Health Department: 3 positions impacted, but will be kept on until December
Davis County Health Department: Still evaluating
Utah County Health Department: No layoffs 
Central Utah Public Health Department (Juab, Millard, Piute, Sevier, Wayne, Sanpete counties): No layoffs
Weber-Morgan Health Department: No layoffs 
Wasatch County Health Department: No layoffs
San Juan County: No layoffs
Summit County and the Tricounty Health Department (Uintah, Daggett, Duchesne counties): Did not immediately respond to a request for comment


Public health workers have “been through a lot together,” Rupp said, adding that “most of these folks have been with us for many years.”
“They genuinely care about their work. They genuinely care about Salt Lake County, and it’s really tragic that they’re not going to be able to continue doing what they love and what they’re good at,” Rupp said. 
He added the Salt Lake County Health Department will continue its work — just with fewer people.
“Collectively, it is a significant loss,” he said. “We in public health will continue to do what we need to to protect community and environmental health in Salt Lake County, but losing these 17 public health professionals doesn’t change the amount of work. … It just means there’s going to be the same amount of work spread across fewer experts.” 
Rupp said these Salt Lake County employees in many cases worked in public health for years. “They are investigating diseases. They’re immunizing children. They’re connecting community members to health resources. And they’re communicating about health topics to the public,” he said. 
While the COVID-19 grants were expected to eventually expire, “the fact that it was an immediate and early end to funds that had been promised to us for another year, in most cases, that is especially challenging,” Rupp said. 
Some of the Salt Lake County workers that will be laid off had expected to finalize certain projects on a defined timeline, “and this change upsets that plan,” Rupp said, though he added Salt Lake County is “working to pivot some additional funding so we can at least appropriately wrap up these projects.”
He also said county officials are working to at least give the 17 workers 30-days notice “so we can appropriately wind down projects, transfer responsibilities, (and) figure out the best way to respond to this.” 
Rupp said Salt Lake County lost roughly $6 million in grants. Later Monday, after county finance officials met to determine next steps, Rupp said county leaders are looking to use about $350,000 in funding from other grants in order to keep the 17 impacted county employees on for about two to 12 weeks, “depending on (their) position and how long we expect it will take to conclude the position’s projects.” 
The Bear River Health Department (which serves Box Elder, Cache and Rich Counties) laid off five people, and their last day was Friday, according to department spokesperson Estee Hunt. She said the layoffs included people working in epidemiology, front office staff, and community health workers. 
“Of course it’s sad,” Hunt said. “We hate to lose our colleagues. It didn’t decrease the amount of work that we have to do, it just meant that the work is going to be spread out among fewer public health professionals. So it’s definitely tricky.” 
The Southwest Utah Health Department (which covers Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington counties), also laid off five community health workers, according to spokesperson David Heaton. 
The Southeast Utah Health Department (which includes Carbon, Emery and Grand counties), laid off two community health workers. The department’s spokesperson, Brittany Garff, said they were given a “couple of weeks” notice. 
“We’re rural, we’re small,” Garff said, adding it will “definitely impact our entire department. We will of course make every effort to cover where they helped the community, but it definitely will be a difficult transition to lose them.”

The Tooele County Health Department said three staff members were impacted by the sudden cut off, impacting three staff members in the county’s Division of Population Health. However, county officials said in an email that “we identified alternative short-term funding to sustain the affected positions until the end of December 2025 and notified the staff members.” 
“This approach will give us time to seek more sustainable funding for the important work our Division of Population Health does around epidemiology, data analysis, community engagement, and health strategy in ways that support the whole health department and county,” Tooele County officials said, though they added, “We are mindful of other health departments throughout the state who have been impacted by these federal funding cuts.”
The Davis County Health Department is still evaluating its impacts, according to spokesperson Trevor Warner. 
“We knew that this funding was going to come to an end, but we didn’t expect it to be this quickly,” he told Utah News Dispatch in a text message. “At this time, we are still evaluating things. We expect an impact because of the funding cuts, but we just don’t know the scale yet.”
The Utah County Health Department won’t have any layoffs, according to spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill, who noted that it had not used federal funding related to COVID-19 since early 2024. 
“Utah County Health Department stopped using all COVID-related funding at the beginning of 2024,” Tolman-Hill said in an email. “Utah County as a whole made a concerted effort not to rely on COVID funds moving forward from early 2024, and the health department followed suit.”
The Central Utah Public Health Department (which includes Juab, Millard, Piute, Sevier, Wayne, Sanpete counties), the Weber-Morgan, Wasatch, and the San Juan health departments all told Utah News Dispatch they have not implemented any layoffs at this time related to the federal cuts, though some job responsibilities had to be “realigned.” 
Officials at Summit County and the Tricounty Health Department (which covers Uintah, Daggett and Duchesne counties) did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch ) CEDAR RAPIDS  — A federal judge heard oral arguments Monday for a case that could overturn a decades-old statute tying wetland conservation to federal farm benefit eligibility. 
The plaintiff CTM Holdings, which owns and rents land to Iowa farmers, sued over the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “swampbuster” law, alleging its implementation is unconstitutional, and that it takes land without any compensation to landowners.
The government defendants and intervening environmental groups argued against CTM and alleged the company had no standing as it had not suffered any injury from the statute.
Chief Judge C.J. Williams, for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, questioned if the whole issue was a “failure to communicate” between the landowner and Natural Resources Conservation Service, which carries out the swampbuster rule. 
The case, CTM Holdings v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, pertains to a 9-acre portion of land in Delaware County which was designated a wetland by NRCS prior to the company’s purchase of the land.

The company wanted to cut down trees and remove stumps from the wetland area, which it alleges is dry land, for the purpose of farming. 
CTM Holdings, represented by the nonprofit litigation groups Liberty Justice Center and Pacific Legal Foundation, argue the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, often referred to as “swampbuster,” unconstitutionally puts conditions on a farmer’s ability to receive farm credits. Additionally, the group holds that farmers are not properly compensated for these wetland easements.  
Iowa Farmers Union, Dakota Rural Action, Food & Water Watch, and Iowa Environmental Council were approved as intervenors in the case, on behalf of USDA and NRCS, in December 2024. 
The groups argued that overturning the swampbuster rule would “threaten” their members and communities by removing wetland conservation practices from neighboring farmland. 
A miscommunication?
Loren Seehase on behalf of CTM Holdings argued the company requested a “redetermination” by NRCS of the wetland portion of the land in 2023, but that it’s “near impossible” to get the agency to reevaluate its ruling. 
The lawsuit holds NRCS “exceeds the statutory definition” by only considering a redetermination if a “natural event alters the topography or hydrology” of the land or if the agency agrees it made an error in its  initial determination. 
Brandon Gray, on behalf of USDA, former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, NRCS and other government officials named in the complaint, said the company did not request a redetermination of the wetland. Gray said the action in 2023 dealt with a different portion of the 72-acre parcel that had not yet been determined, though he agreed the letters from NRCS were “confusing.”
Judge Williams wondered if this was just a misunderstanding between CTM and the regulating agency. 
Jim Conlan, owner of CTM Holdings, with over 1,000 acres of land in Iowa, said the opposing counsel was “very creative” with this argument and holds that he did apply for a redetermination of the wetland. 
Seehase, Conlan’s attorney, said it is “disingenuous” for the government to say NRCS did a “piecemeal” determination in 2023 rather than examining the whole property. 
Compensation
Seehase said CTM “has and will continue to suffer” under swampbuster because the 9 acres of the parcel cannot be rented.
The lawsuit also holds that the landowner should be compensated for the wetland acreage that cannot be farmed. Seehase said there should be a program for wetlands like the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to keep sensitive land in long-term vegetative covers. 
Dani Replogle, staff attorney with the environmental group Food & Water Watch, one of the intervenors, said this argument doesn’t “have a leg to stand on.” 
“The compensation is clearly the farm benefits that swampbuster provides access to,” Replogle said. 
These farm benefits include crop insurance and other important farming subsidies distributed by USDA.
Judge Williams asked if it was “coercive” on behalf of the government to condition these funds.
Gray, for USDA, said swampbuster does not stop property owners from doing what they want to the land. He said the fact that government subsidies are “a good deal” for farmers doesn’t mean it’s coercive. 
He said the conditions follow Congress’ directive to ensure government spending is for the “general welfare.”
Kathleen Garvey, on behalf of the intervenors, said there are also “myriad” exemptions from swampbuster, including a farmer’s ability to drain and farm over a wetland by purchasing a mitigation credit. 
Garvey said ruling in favor of the plaintiff would “radically curtail” Congress’ power and “drastically change” farm policy. 
She said CTM Holdings has not suffered injury from the issue, and said the company actually profited from a lower purchase price of the land, the sale of timber on the wetland portion and it has maintained consistent farming tenants.
Jeffery McCoy, with Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of CTM Holdings, said the injury is in the government’s “ask” to “waive a constitutional right” to receive benefits. 
“Farmers need crop insurance,” McCoy said. 
Seehase said “it’s really not a choice” for a farmer to forgo their farm benefits. CTM Holdings is eligible for farm benefits, which Conlan said are passed on to his tenants in return for a higher lease price.
Plaintiffs also argued the NRCS definition of altering a wetland exceeds the statute set by Congress. 
The law holds that filling, draining, leveling, clearing woody vegetation or diverting run-off water are all actions considered to alter a wetland for the purpose of agriculture use. 
Gray, on behalf of the government, said just because the statute and the agency rules are different, does not automatically mean the intent is also different. 
Gray said it is the agency’s job to define a statute to make it applicable.  
Change in swampbuster would have lasting implications 
According to a study from the Union of Concerned Scientists, wetlands provide protection from residential flood damages that equal nearly $23 billion annually. Wetlands in Iowa alone have the potential to mitigate $477 million, annually, in flood damage according to the study. 
The same study approximates there are more than 640,000 acres of wetlands in Iowa, though the Iowa Department of Natural Resources estimates the state has lost 95% of what were once wetlands, the majority of which were drained for agricultural uses. 
Defendants of swampbuster feel that without the law, wetlands across the country would be drained. 
“The impacts of us losing the case would be that federal farm benefits would be open to any farmer or holding company or corporate landowner that wanted to just destroy all the ecosystems on their property and farm every acre,” Replogle, one of the intervening attorneys, said.
Replogle said the lawsuit would have implications on quite a few federal farm credit programs that have eligibility requirements, especially on a similar statute, known as “sodbuster” which protects highly erodible land from being farmed. 
Replogle said there is “no limiting principle” in CTM Holdings’ case that would prevent sodbuster from being ruled unconstitutional along with swampbuster. 
Judge Williams said he will take the oral arguments into advisory and issue judgment at a later date. 
Both parties said they would appeal the case if the judge rules against them.

State Republican leaders say the fire early Sunday morning was politically motivated arson. According to Albuquerque Fire Rescue, the blaze occurred a little before 6 a.m., causing damage to the front entryway and smoke damage throughout the building. No one was injured and the fire was extinguished within five minutes, according to AFR. 
The cause is being investigated, AFR and Republican leaders said. 
The FBI and ATF are investigating, according to AFR and Republican officials. As of Monday afternoon, no search warrants had been filed, according to a Source New Mexico review of federal court records.
Along with the fire damage, someone stenciled “ICE=KKK” in red spray paint on the side of the building. The stencil was partially covered with plywood before the news conference Monday afternoon. 
The news conference came after a day of sniping between Democrats and Republicans over who is to blame for the deterioration of political discourse here. 
Republicans cited a Santa Fe town hall meeting Saturday when U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) called on attendees to “agitate” as part of a strategy to combat President Donald Trump’s agenda, along with “legislate” and “litigate.” The party also circulated a fundraising appeal with the headline “They tried to silence us.”
The Democratic Party of New Mexico condemned the alleged arson but said Republicans were “maliciously and falsely” claiming the congresswoman’s call for political organizing amounted to incitement of violence.

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Chair Jessica Velasquez said in a statement. 
The New Mexico Democrats statement also cited the recent conviction of Solomon Peña, a failed Republican state House candidate, for shooting up the homes of prominent Democratic lawmakers. (No one was injured.)
Asked Monday afternoon whether the Republican party overreacted by blaming Leger Fernandez’s town hall meeting, Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the New Mexico Senate minority leader, said he wished to take the temperature down. 
“What I’m looking for right now is to tone down the rhetoric by everybody. Calm down,” he said. “Because somebody’s going to get hurt.”
Multiple speakers sought to link the alleged arson to what they say is out-of-control crime, adding it to a list with the March 21 mass shooting in Las Cruces, plus murders and carjackings. 
“This attack is a symptom of something far larger,” said Amy Barela, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. “A growing wave of emboldened, unchecked crime across our state.”
A report last summer by the Legislative Finance Committee found that violent crime in Bernalillo County has plateaued since 2017. 
Right after the final gavel of the 60-day legislative session, Republican leaders called on Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call lawmakers back for a special session focused on increasing criminal penalties.

Two teachers and two students were killed and multiple students were injured. Megan Varner/Getty ImagesA bill that sets up new security protocols that are intended to prevent another school shooting in Georgia is now in the governor’s hands.
The 57-page proposal is a priority for House Speaker Jon Burns this year. When the measure came back to the House for a final vote Monday, it was missing some key elements from an earlier version such as a student database meant to help school districts communicate but that raised concerns that it would stigmatize students and hurt their future opportunities.
Burns, along with Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, issued a joint statement Monday celebrating the bill’s passage. In September, a 14-year-old accused gunman killed two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Barrow County and injured nine others.
The bill, sponsored by Winder Republican Rep. Holt Persinger, attempts to address what is seen as a communication lapse that preceded the shooting. The year before the shooting, Colt Gray was interviewed by law enforcement regarding threatening social media posts targeting another school in Jackson County – information that did not follow Gray to Barrow County. 
The measure would require districts to transfer a student’s records to a new district within five days, and it would set up a statewide alert system about potential threats to schools. 
Cowsert said the bill also attempts to target the common denominator of many of the school shootings nationwide: mental health. The proposal creates “qualified student advocacy specialists” who will focus on identifying troubled students and connecting them with mental health services, and it requires students to participate in training for suicide awareness and youth violence prevention.
The Senate also added another bill that would require all public schools to install a panic button system. Apalachee High School had issued panic buttons to its teachers a week before the shooting and that is credited with helping law enforcement respond quickly to the campus.
The bill also increases penalties for terroristic acts, and it would treat children between ages 13 to 17 as adults when they face charges for terroristic acts at school, attempted murder and aggregate aggravated assault if committed with a firearm. 
“That is beyond just school safety,” said Sen. RaShaun Kemp, an Atlanta Democrat who voted against the bill. “So, this could capture, for example, a kid who has been wrapped up in a gang, and their lives could be drastically changed as a result of this.” 
Democrats have pressed for legislation requiring safe gun storage in the wake of the shooting. But a House bill that was originally designed to encourage safe gun storage is now limited to firearm training and includes a controversial tax break on firearm purchases. 
Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat who has filed a bill requiring safe firearm storage, floated an amendment Monday that called for distributing information on gun safety through the school systems. Parent withdrew the proposal after Cowsert said he would join forces with her to do that as a separate measure. 
Parent said her proposal takes a cue from Texas, although lawmakers there mandated safe storage after the Robb Elementary School shooting in 2022.
“It’s simply an education piece,” Parent said of her proposal. “It’s not unlike the violence and suicide prevention pieces of (House Bill 268). I view it as a no-downside way to try to make our kids and our schools a bit safer.”

(Photo by Kevin Winter / Getty Images)A New Mexico judge on Monday blocked access to public records clearly showing the bodies of actor Gene Hackman or his wife classical pianist Betsy Arakawa-Hackman, who were found dead in their home outside Santa Fe in February, but is allowing the release of many other investigative documents.
Julia Peters, who handles the Hackmans’ estates, on March 11 asked the court to block the county and state Office of the Medical Investigator from releasing “any and all photographic evidence, video evidence, and body cam footage” they gathered in investigating their deaths, along with any autopsy reports and death investigation reports. 
The court on March 17 temporarily shielded those records from publication while the parties prepared for Monday’s hearing.
Attorney Kurt Sommer on Monday argued on Peters’ behalf that the Hackmans would not want their privacy invaded by having their tragic deaths “exploited by the press.” He also said their right to control their names and likeness didn’t go away when they died, that disclosing the records would violate their right to privacy under the U.S. Constitution, and that it would run the risk of allowing potential burglars to more easily steal from the home.
“The disclosure of the videos is simply another way of circumventing the control the estate should retain as the Hackmans did during their lifetime,” Sommer said. “The request for the video cam is nothing more than a backdoor exposure of the Hackmans’ lifestyle that could not be attained by the press during their lifetime.”
County Attorney Walker Boyd argued that the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) did not give the county government “any discretion” to deny requests to inspect the public records created when sheriff’s deputies searched the Hackmans’ home.
“The court’s recognition of a potential privacy right to preclude disclosure of these records creates not only administrative difficulty for the county,” Boyd said. “How does the county comply with that right going forward?”
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson, however, allowed the release of videos depicting the Hackmans’ bodies, so long as they are blurred. He also allowed the release of autopsy reports, and any photos or videos showing the inside of the Hackmans’ home or of their dead dogs.

Scot Sauder, deputy university counsel for the University of New Mexico that houses the Office of the Medical Investigator, said that while autopsy photos are public records, “the OMI has long believed that those autopsy photographs are incredibly invasive, are very much disturbing and can be quite traumatic and embarrassing to family and their kin.”
Wilson also allowed release of any audio containing descriptions of their bodies.
Criminal defense attorney Dan Cron, who testified as an expert witness for the Hackman estate, said lapel cameras record audio and while he hasn’t reviewed the records in this case, he would expect them to contain an audio description of what the deputies were experiencing as they searched the Hackmans’ home.
Gregory MacKenzie, the attorney for Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie Allen Hackman, said the Hackman children’s primary concern was the release of video or audio describing their father’s dead body.
“There’s no limit to the trauma that could cause my clients for years to come,” he said.
The New Mexico Legislature in 2023 amended the state Inspection of Public Records Act to allow the government to redact otherwise public records if they depict dead bodies or great bodily harm, unless a police officer is suspected of having caused the harm.
Wilson allowed CBS News and the Associated Press to intervene in the case. Gregory Williams, attorney for the media outlets, argued that New Mexico law says that a person’s right to privacy ends at their death.
“No such right exists in New Mexico in a way that trumps IPRA, and if it did, the entities before the court don’t possess privacy rights necessary to overcome that,” Williams said.
Wilson ruled that Hackman’s children and Arakawa-Hackman’s mother have a right to privacy over images depicting their loved ones’ death scenes, found in the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Wilson relied on prior court rulings in California and Washington that the publication of any death scene photographs would violate a family’s due process rights, and said permanently blocking Santa Fe County from publishing them in this case is a reasonable way to prevent that happening to the Hackmans.
Wilson ruled from the bench on Monday afternoon after a three-hour hearing.
Hackman won numerous Academy awards during an acting career that spanned decades. Susan Madore, Hackman’s publicist for the last 27 years, testified via Zoom that he moved to Santa Fe because it offered relative anonymity compared to Los Angeles.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office found the Hackmans’ bodies in their home outside of Santa Fe on Feb. 26. Investigators found Arakawa-Hackman, 65, died from the rodent-borne hantavirus pulmonary syndrome on Feb. 11, and Hackman, 95, died from heart disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a contributing factor on Feb. 18.

The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”

In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.
Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
 Starting with Utah

PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
 Reasonable and prudent

Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.



How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?
In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund. The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities. PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill banning lab-grown meat from Nebraska advanced Monday to a second round in the statehouse after a two-hour debate. Legislative Bill 246 advanced 33-1. 
Nebraska would join a handful of states that have introduced legislation banning cell-derived meat. The bill was introduced at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, who owns a major hog operation based in Columbus. Several lawmakers expressed concerns over the safety of lab-grown meat, while others called the bill a waste of time. 
 The proposed law doesn’t ban alternative-meat products like Impossible Burger, which is made entirely from plants. The cell-derived meat it targets is produced from animal cells, enabling the cells to multiply and differentiate into muscle, fat, and connective tissue without slaughtering animals. The bill would ban the production, import, distribution, promotion, display or sale of any cultivated-protein food in the state. 
If passed, Nebraska would be the fourth state to implement a ban on lab-grown meat; Mississippi is expected to be the third once its Governor signs it into law. Florida and Alabama have banned cultivating and selling meat grown in laboratories in recent years 
Bill author State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, said the bill aims to protect the Nebraska meat industry and consumers from “adulterated food’s effects.”
“Our goal is not to throw people in jail or impose heavy monetary penalties,” DeKay said. “It’s just to keep the product off the shelves.” 
Mississippi’s ban punishes anyone growing or selling lab-grown meat with a $500 fine and up to three months in jail. Lab-grown meat has been a subject of culture war politics, as some national Republicans say a ban is an attempt to stop the “elitist” class from promoting unnatural foods. State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said she had leaned toward voting no before researching the topic. On Monday, Storer said not banning lab-grown meat is “sending a message to the people of Nebraska that we believe it’s safe.” 
“I cannot look someone in the eye right now and tell them that self-cultivated meat is safe,” Storer said. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., behind only Texas. Cattle and other livestock production are among Nebraska’s largest industries, bringing nearly $31.6 billion to the state, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. 
The Food and Drug Administration approved lab-grown meat for human consumption in 2022. DeKay alluded to a ban in France and other European countries as proof that his concerns over the safety of lab-grown meat are valid.  
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said lab-grown meat is a non-issue, because the product is not yet in stores and is just an issue that gives the governor “a win.” Conrad added that there are other solutions, such as labeling the meat as lab-grown. 
“I think it’s beneath the Legislature…it’s out of touch with what most Nebraskans want,” Conrad said.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau supported legislation that would label lab-grown meat but not ban it outright. 
Pillen has said he supported the bill as a way for the state to protect consumers and defend agriculture because it’s the lifeblood of Nebraska’s economy. After the vote, the governor said, “The creation of this bioreactor meat is simply a dishonest attack on producers in our state,” on X. 
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair said the state has bigger issues to deal with. 
“Beer and bugs, tackling the important matters that matter to Nebraskans,”  Hansen said sarcastically. “I’m hoping we’ll get to property taxes.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)COLFAX– As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.

Speaking with reports at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

Free.,Federal judge pauses Trump DHS effort to strip protections for Venezuelans,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-pauses-trump-dhs-effort-strip-protections-venezuelans,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in California on Monday blocked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from terminating the temporary protected status of more than 350,000 Venezuelans next week.The group was set to lose deportation protections by April 7 after DHS Security Kristi Noem, in her first week in office, vacated an extension of  protections put in place by the Biden administration.The order does not apply to a separate group of 250,000 Venezuelans who are set to lose their status in September.U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California said the groups that brought the suit against the Trump administration are likely to succeed in their claims. He noted that Noem’s decision to vacate the temporary protected status for Venezuelans was not only arbitrary and capricious, but would harm the TPS holders, cost the U.S. billions in economic loss and harm public health and safety in U.S. communities.DHS did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Program for immigrants in dangerTPS allows nationals from countries deemed too dangerous to return to remain in the U.S. Those with the status have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the U.S. for 18 months, unless extended by the DHS secretary.Under Biden administration orders, protections were extended until October 2026 for two groups of Venezuelans, one initially assigned temporary protected status in 2021 and another in 2023.Chen’s order applies only to the group who first gained status in 2023. The 2021 group is also challenging the Trump administration’s revocation of their status, but that group’s status is in place until September.Chen noted that the Trump administration “failed to identify any real countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries.”Chen was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011.Gang activity citedThe groups who brought the suit against Noem represent TPS holders from Venezuela.The groups argued that Noem’s decisions to vacate the 2023 protections and end TPS for Venezuelans were arbitrary and capricious.They also argued that the Trump administration violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause, arguing that the decisions to vacate the extension and terminate protections “were motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.”Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the 2023 group of Venezuelans.The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport any Venezuelan national 14 years or older who is suspected of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. A federal judge has placed a temporary restraining order on use of the wartime law.‘Classic example of racism’In his order, Chen said that while attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argued that there is the threat of the Tren de Aragua gang, “it has made no showing that any Venezuelans TPS holders are members of the gang or otherwise have ties to the gang.”Chen also rejected the Trump administration’s argument that Noem had the legal authority to vacate the extension of protections.“The unprecedented action of vacating existing TPS (a step never taken by any previous administration in the 35 years of the TPS program), initiated just three days after Secretary Noem took office, reverses actions taken by the Biden administration to extend temporary protection of Venezuelan nationals that have been in place since 2021,” he wrote.In granting the nationwide pause, Chen noted the groups had a strong claim under the equal protection clause because Noem has “made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.”“This is evident not only in what she said, but also in the fact that she decided to take en masse actions against all Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries, who number in the hundreds of thousands,” he said. “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism.”This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS designation for certain nationals. During Trump’s first term, DHS tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.Noem has also moved to end TPS for nationals from Haiti, which there are currently legal suits against that decision.",,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

That was just one finding of an audit that cited payroll, procurement and human resources issues.","Prince George's County Schools Superintendent Millard House II holds a media briefing in a 2023 file photo from Upper Marlboro. (File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A Prince George’s County substitute teacher was paid more than $7 million in 2022 — and two months passed before the school system recouped the funds.
That was the most remarkable finding in a new legislative audit of the county school system, which described a number of ongoing issues with the system’s payroll, procurement and human resources procedures.
The Maryland Department of Legislative Services audit also found that the school system failed to consistently complete a screening process for employees who have contact with children, and that it failed to investigate 9,376 missing items identified in a 2023 inventory, which were valued at about $6.3 million.
School system contracts also came under the microscope, and auditors concluded that the school district’s “procurement policies were not sufficiently comprehensive and were not consistently used when obtaining goods and services.” The school system did not always prepare written justifications, or seek school board approval for expenses, according to the audit.
The audit, dated March 25 and sent to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, said the 2022 overpayment for the substitute teacher occurred when a school system employee mistakenly entered the teacher’s identification number in the “hours” field. That led to the teacher being paid for approximately 73,000 work days, rather than three.
School system officials didn’t realize the overpayment had occurred until more than 50 days later. They recovered the funds within a few days, the audit said.

Payroll problems at the state’s second-largest school system have been persistent, the latest audit said. “Similar conditions regarding the human resource and payroll supervisory reviews were commented upon in our two preceding audit reports,” the audit said.
The school system did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the audit Monday. But in its written response to the audit findings, the system said it has “implemented several preventive measures to improve payroll accuracy and efficiency,” including hiring two new staffers, enhancing training and setting new limits on payroll data entries.
“Any staff member will be held accountable for overpayments that were caused by their inaccurate entries,” the school system added.
In 2019, a new Maryland law took effect requiring school systems to conduct special screenings for employees who would have contact with minors. But auditors checked 10 employees who had been hired in Prince George’s after the law’s effective date, and only three had been screened, even though they had been working with the system for six months or more, according to the audit.
As part of the screenings, school systems must send forms to an applicants’ prior employers, certifying that the person was never the subject of of a child sexual abuse or sexual misconduct investigation by any employer that resulted in a finding.
In Prince George’s County, the process was monitored by an employee “who did not send forms to prior employers, and/or failed to follow up with those employers that did not return a completed form,” the school system said in its response to the audit.
But the school system maintained that three of the 10 applicants didn’t need forms on file, because they did not have prior jobs wherein they had contact with children. One of the 10 applicants had a foreign employer, to which a form was not sent.
The system said it has since debuted an electronic signature program to expedite the screening forms, and it pledged to follow up with the state about “instances where prior employers do not return the required form.”

In evaluating the school system’s procurement procedures, state auditors raised the red flag on two purchases in particular.
Auditors found fault with a contract for cameras aboard school buses because it wasn’t put out for a competitive bid, and auditors questioned higher-than-average fees paid per bus. In response, the county pledged to ensure that future procurements comply with state law, and to document the reasoning for fee amounts.
In addition, the county paid two nonpublic schools $61.3 million for special education services between 2020 and 2023, but there was no written contract, and no board approval, according to the state audit. The county pledged to require written contracts “with each non-public school where we place a student,” and to submit an annual report to the Board about the placements and expenditures.
Prince George’s school officials also failed to follow the system’s policy for equipment tracking, which requires full inventories of any items over $1,500 in value to be conducted every three years.
The school system conducted an inventory in 2019, but then skipped 2022’s inventory, citing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the district completed a partial audit, but did not follow up on the findings, which indicated more than $6 million worth of equipment was not accounted for.
In its response, the school system said it initiated a new inventory in spring 2024, beginning with students’ electronic devices in each school. This spring, the school system will conduct an inventory of other classroom technology. The school system is also finalizing a plan to complete inventories every three years, which “will be implemented beginning January 2026 with an estimated completion of January 2029.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Millard-House-II-7-11-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, attends a House Judiciary Committee meeting on Jan. 28, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that would clarify state public meetings law by specifying what members of city councils, quorum courts or school boards can discuss outside of a public meeting.
Senate Bill 227, sponsored by Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, would also allow a court to nullify any decisions made by a public body if it was in violation of open meetings laws, would add a cybersecurity breach as a reason to meet in executive session, and would regulate remote meeting attendance.
Under current state law, the number of people needed for a meeting to qualify as public is not defined, but has generally been interpreted to mean a meeting where at least two members of a governing body meet. Tucker’s bill would make that more explicit.
The legislation passed with 87 out of the 99 members present voting for the bill; five voted against it and five voted present. Two lawmakers abstained and Rep. Stephen Magie, D-Conway, was absent.
The bill, which already passed the Senate once, was amended to add co-sponsors after it was sent to the House, so it will be returned to the Senate for another vote.
While the measure passed with broad margins in the House, Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, stood to urge colleagues to vote it down.
“We’re starting down a slippery slope when we start fooling around with the Freedom of Information Act as it relates to the public knowledge and transparency in government,” Wooten warned. 
Wooten expressed concerns that the language of the bill would allow board members to discuss their positions on public business, and then pressure other members behind the scenes. A separate bill, SB 376, would define a public meeting as one where more than two members of a government entity met. That bill is awaiting a hearing in the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, and has been opposed by government transparency advocates.
Eubanks said that provisions included in the bill would prohibit that kind of behavior while providing needed clarity to local officials alongside transparency.
“I spent 10 years on a school board, and I can assure you I did not know what the rules were, and I don’t think anybody else did either,” Eubanks said. “I think this is important, and it’s going to allow school board associations, counties, Municipal League to have clear understanding of what is allowed so that they can give the proper training to the members of those boards.”
The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act of 1967 gives Arkansans the right to obtain government records, such as emails. However, vague definitions of what exactly constituted a public meeting has led to litigation as local government bodies ran afoul of sunshine provisions.
Tucker’s bill has garnered support from state FOIA advocates, including the Arkansas Press Association. The association’s president, Andrew Bagley, called Tucker’s bill “a very good piece of legislation” during a committee meeting March 12.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislators introduced two bills Friday that would add new legal protections for transgender people and expand insurance coverage for gender-affirming health care. 
House Bill 25-1309 prohibits health insurance plans from denying or limiting medically necessary gender-affirming health care services. Care is considered medically necessary under the bill if a health care provider determines it to be so. The bill also exempts testosterone from state prescription drug use monitoring program tracking requirements.
Gender-affirming care, endorsed by both the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, can range from non-medical interventions, such as haircuts and name changes, to services such as hormone therapy and surgery to support the patient’s gender identity. The bill focuses on medical care, including psychiatric, surgical or therapeutic supplies and services. It would also include coverage for cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries.

“HB25-1309 demonstrates Colorado’s commitment to fairness, equity, and the right to make our own decisions about our bodies,” Nadine Bridges, executive director of LGBTQ+ advocacy organization One Colorado, said in a statement. “No one should have to fight for the health care they need. This bill ensures our community has the protection and stability we all deserve.”
Colorado’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program operates under the Department of Regulatory Agencies and is meant to help reduce drug misuse. Pharmacies upload information on who is prescribed controlled substances, which can then be accessed by DORA, law enforcement, other practitioners and pharmacists, and patients themselves. HB-1309 would block archived reports of testosterone prescriptions from view to protect the privacy of people who take it for gender-affirming care. 
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat, Rep. Kyle Brown, a Boulder Democrat, Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, and Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat. It was assigned to the House Health and Human Services Committee, where it will go through its first bill hearing. 
School policies
House Bill 25-1312, dubbed the Kelly Loving Act in honor of a transgender woman killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, adds various new legal protections for transgender people in education, family legal matters, and public accommodation. 
Colorado courts would be prohibited from complying with orders or laws from other states that threaten to take children away from parents or caregivers who allowed the child access to gender-affirming care. When a judge is hearing a child custody case, the court would have to consider deadnaming, misgendering or threatening to publish information related to an individual or child’s gender-affirming care as a form of “coercive control.” Deadnaming — when someone calls a transgender person by their previous name — and misgendering would also be defined as discriminatory acts in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.
The bill would require that schools, if they establish policies related to chosen names, must include all reasons that a student might choose to use a name that’s different from their legal name. Dress code policies must also not include any rules based on gender, and each student must be permitted to abide by any variation of the dress code based on gender. 
Any form administered by a public entity that requires an individual to disclose their name would have to include the option to provide a legal name and a chosen name. If someone’s chosen name differs from their legal name, the public entity would have to use the chosen name on all subsequent forms. 
The Kelly Loving Act is sponsored by Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat, Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat, Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, and Sen. Chris Kolker, a Littleton Democrat. The bill was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, where it will get its first hearing.

Wisconsin [&#8230;]","Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway alongside other Wisconsinites at a city celebration for Transgender Day of Visibility. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner. Wisconsin Democrats and city of Madison leaders recognized transgender visibility day in Wisconsin Monday, introducing legislation that would provide protections for people and raising the transgender pride flag. 
This year’s International Transgender Day of Visibility comes amid a political environment in which trans people have been targeted by new proposed federal and state restrictions. Wisconsin Republican lawmakers spent significant time in March on a slate of bills focused on transgender kids and would have limited their ability to play sports, access gender affirming medical care and change their names and pronouns in school. The bills are among more than 800 anti-trans bills that have been introduced nationwide this year.
Participants in the Madison celebrations said the point of the day was not to focus on the negative and harmful actions being taken, however, but to focus instead on the positive experiences of being transgender. 
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove), co-chair of the Transgender Parent and Nonbinary Advocacy Caucus, said during a press conference that the purpose of the day is to “elevate the voices of our trans and non-binary communities, emphasize the joy of living life as your authentic self and to visualize the world in which all our trans and non-binary children, co-workers, neighbors, parents and elected officials throughout Wisconsin and the world are loved, accepted and safe.”
Democrats holding the press conference proposed a handful of bills. One would extend Wisconsin’s nondiscrimination laws to include transgender and nonbinary people by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity or gender expression.
Another bill would create an exception to current law for those seeking a name change for gender identity reasons. Under the current state statute people seeking a name change petition must publish notice of their petition in a local newspaper, including in the area where the petition will be heard, once per week for three consecutive weeks before they may petition the court.
A third bill would declare March 31, 2025 as Transgender Day of Visibility in Wisconsin and recognizes the achievements of several transgender people and organizations who have made contributions to Wisconsin.
In addition to the bills, Gov. Tony Evers, who has committed to vetoing any anti-trans legislation that makes it to his desk, signed a proclamation declaring Monday Transgender Day of Visibility.
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said the bills are important because lawmakers need to send a positive message to young Wisconsinites who may be paying attention. He said that when he was young he remembers feeling discouraged as a gay teen when the state passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. 
“Thirteen-year-olds across Wisconsin are listening to political actions and messages that are being sent out of the Capitol,” Phelps said, adding that children should know there are elected officials and allies and leaders who are fighting for transgender, non-binary and gender-expansive people of all ages across Wisconsin.
“That’s the message that we want people to take out of the Capitol and into their communities and to see [protections] passed in the state law as well,” Phelps said. 
When asked about plans to discuss the legislation with Republicans and the potential for garnering support across the aisle to pass any of the bills, the lawmakers sounded doubtful. Republicans hold majorities in the Assembly and Senate and support from them would be necessary for any of the Democratic legislation to be taken up.
“I don’t think they will sign on to this legislation. I certainly wish that they would take a look at it and hear our voices here today and see the love and support of so many community members,” Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) said. 
Clancy called it a “valid question” that Democrats get every time they hold a press conference. 
“Will Republicans sign on to this? And every time the answer is somewhat the same…,” Clancy said. “Republicans, two weeks ago, sat on the floor of the Assembly just feet from here for hours. They said that trans people should not exist, should not have basic rights. They have had the opportunity to weigh in on this, and I would welcome any of them moving across the aisle, breaking ranks from their, frankly, hateful leadership and joining in on these things.” 
The city of Madison also recognized Transgender Visibility Day by raising the transgender pride flag outside of the city municipal building.
Mayor Satya Rhodes Conway said the city was raising the flag to celebrate trans people, because the city respects individual rights and “rejects hate.” 
“The safety and the livelihoods of trans people are being threatened, and the issue of the fact of trans people is being used to divide our country in a hateful and really disappointing way, but here in Madison, we refuse to go backwards, and we refuse to let hate divide.” 
Asked about communicating the message of acceptance to those who disagree, Rhodes-Conway said that she thinks it’s important people recognize that diversity makes the Madison community stronger and invited people to “learn about the things that maybe make them nervous or scared and to be a part of the incredible diversity.” 
Rhodes-Conway also urged people to educate themselves.
“Folks can educate themselves and each other and a lot of the fear and resistance comes from lack of knowing, and so I just encourage people — there’s a lot of resources,” Rhodes-Conway said. “Please don’t ask the trans people in your lives to educate you. There’s a lot of resources out there and our libraries, our fantastic resources, and people can educate themselves about the history.”
Dina Nina Martinez-Rutherford, the first out transgender member of the Madison Common Council, said that transgender people are all “part of an unbroken legacy of resilience” and “authenticity.” 
Martinez-Rutherford said that she never expected to feel “so much love and community” when first elected in 2023 and never expected when she first started transitioning in 2007 to be in a position to advocate for people. 
“We raise the transgender flag today for it to be a symbol that Madison is welcoming and that you belong here,” Martinez-Rutherford said. “Let it be a beacon of hope, a reminder that we will not be erased.”

Ron DeSantis visited Montana urging lawmakers to pass a resolution asking for a Constitutional Convention in order to craft a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Montana Senators shot down the proposal.
Senate Joint Resolution 4 sought a convention of the states for the “sole purpose” of proposing the balanced budget amendment. The resolution saw a 5-4 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, but was indefinitely postponed on the Senate Floor on March 27 after failing to pass the chamber 23-27.
The Senate spent more than an hour debating the measure on the floor before voting it down.
“I rise in support of SJ 4 because it represents the only chance the Montana Legislature has to take action in the fight to prevent Congress from bankrupting America,” Sen. Mark Noland, R-Bigfork, said, introducing the measure on the floor. “There are good people on both sides of this debate, but the other side offers no solution, only their opposition.”
Making an impassioned speech about the need to reign in Congressional spending and the national debt, Noland said it wouldn’t be long before the country’s “interest payments will spiral out of control, until we enter what we call a doom loop.”
Some opponents spoke about their worry that calling a convention of the states specifically to propose a single amendment wasn’t possible — it could open a can of worms and allow any proposed changes to the Constitution to be debated, including stripping out existing rights.
“We control our delegates, maybe, but we can’t control the delegates from the other 49 states,” Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Glendive, said. “There are too many enemies of our country, and of our Constitution, that would be the delegates. Their goal will not be the same as ours.”
But proponents pushed back by reminding lawmakers that any proposed changes to the Constitution would still have to be ratified by a super-majority of state legislatures.
“If they come in there and want to do a little monkey business and strip out the Second Amendment, or other amendments, it still needs 38 states to ratify what they’ve done,” Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said. “And if they can, then our country is really, really in trouble if we got 38 states that really want to throw out most of our Constitution.”
Despite the impassioned pleas from many Republican legislators, proponents were unable to swing a majority of lawmakers in favor of the legislation.
DeSantis and Gov. Gianforte had held a lunchtime discussion with lawmakers and a joint press conference a few days before, touting the need to reign in spending in Washington, D.C., and pointing out that 49 of the 50 states are required to balance their budgets.
“In Washington, they’ve been spending like drunken sailors, and that’s not what our founding fathers envisioned,” Gianforte said during the press conference. “We need to change — and fast — to prevent our children and grandchildren from inheriting this mess that they’ve created. As you know, there is no constitutional limit on congressional borrowing. It’s up to Congress to police itself.”
DeSantis said that 27 states, including Florida, had already passed resolutions calling for a balanced budget amendment, with 34 needed to enact the convention.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/balancethebudget-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

Competing bills introduced by Republican and Democrat legislators have swirled through both chambers, but lawmakers have had difficulty reaching a compromise or consensus on how best to deliver tax relief to Montanans, many who have seen significant increases in property values, and their tax bills, in recent years — a trend that is expected to continue unless the Legislature acts.
But on Monday, the Senate voted unanimously for a Sen. Wylie Galt’s “Plan C” bill, to deliver $400 rebates to primary property owners across the state, similar to rebates that went out in 2023.
“We’re getting close at the end of the session. We haven’t had any property tax across the finish line yet, so this is a backup plan,” said Galt, R-Martinsdale, on the Senate floor. “If nothing else comes, we at least have something that we can give out to the people of Montana until we keep trying to figure out the long term sustainable property tax cuts.”
Senate Bill 434  would allow homeowners to collect a one-time rebate of “$400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less,” on a property they lived in for at least seven consecutive months in 2024. Eligible homeowners would be able to submit their claims between August 15 and Oct. 1 of 2025.
“Montanans have faced ever-increasing property taxes, and my bill will provide needed relief in the form of rebates as permanent, comprehensive solutions are discussed,” Galt said in a statement after the vote.
SB 434 will have a hearing before the Senate Finance and Claims Committee before receiving a final vote in the Senate, and moving on to the lower chamber.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1154736495-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A bill to create tax incentives for oil drilling outside of North Dakota’s primary production areas passed the Senate on Monday, along with a possible study of the rising number of low-producing wells and their tax status. 
The Senate Finance and Taxation Committee amended House Bill 1483 to increase the amount of oil that could be produced under the tax break and lengthen the time period that the break would be in effect. 
Most of North Dakota’s oil comes from the Bakken and Three Forks formations. The bill would encourage development in other geologic formations. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, previously testified that North Dakota has 10 other formations with oil production potential. 
The first 300,000 barrels of oil produced during the first 36 months after a well is completed outside the Bakken and Three Forks formations would be taxed at a lower rate — 2% of the gross value of the oil. The typical oil extraction tax rate is 5%. 
North Dakota sees uptick in oil wells that qualify for tax exemption

Rep. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, said the wells would still produce tax revenue in other ways, such as sales taxes. 
In addition, the wells would still be subject to the 5% gross production tax, which is paid in lieu of property taxes. 
The tax break does not apply to wells within a reservation unless the tribe opts in, under the amended bill.
The bill also says Legislative Management shall consider a study of low-producing wells, known as stripper wells. Low-producing Bakken and Three Forks wells become exempt from the extraction tax after 12 consecutive months of producing no more than 35 barrels per day. 
The interim legislative study would examine the fiscal impact of the exemption and alternative tax policies for stripper wells. Some lawmakers have questioned whether it’s good tax policy to allow wells to be classified as stripper wells forever, even if their production increases in the future with enhanced oil recovery. Nearly half of all North Dakota oil wells now qualify for the stripper well tax exemption.
The Senate changes will need to be adopted by the House or differences can be resolved in a conference committee.

Brad Little for consideration.
Idaho also needs federal approval for the proposed ban.
House Bill 109 would require the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
And, he said, soda is the “number one commodity spent on SNAP.”
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 48-20 vote on Monday, after the chamber had already narrowly approved the bill. It came back to the House after the Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition. The Idaho Senate passed an amended version of the bill on a 25-10 vote last week.
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, critiqued the bill as another way to control poor people.
Sen. Camille Blaylock, R-Caldwell, suggested it isn’t likely Idaho would make the change alone. Idaho’s waiver, she argued, would join other states’ requests, applying pressure for a nationwide change.
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.
Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say
Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, contain milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact.
Republican legislators in Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming introduced similar bills, Stateline reported.

Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed two bills into law that will give local governments more ways to access money to aid in disaster recovery and emergency response.
One will allow the use of property tax bonds to fix infrastructure damaged by floodwaters, and the other will change a funding mechanism to help cities and towns purchase ambulances. Lujan Grisham signed them both Friday.
“These bills provide critical tools for our municipalities to recover from devastating floods and strengthen our emergency medical services across the state,” the Democratic governor Lujan Grisham said in a written statement Monday.
The first law, Senate Bill 383, expands the use of revenue bonds to include “rebuilding, repairing, replacing, and hardening of municipal property damaged by a flood,” and allows local governments including cities and counties to implement a 0.327% gross tax to help pay for the bonds.
Previously, the law only allowed municipalities to enact the tax on property or services bought within the area.
Sen. Candy Spence Ezzell (R-Roswell) the sponsor of SB 383, said she was “beyond thrilled,” about the signing when reached by phone on Monday. The new law  will allow Roswell to raise funds to apply for federal dollars after devastating floods ripped through the community in October, killing two people.
“It will help Roswell get matching funds where they can apply for the FEMA money to help with getting everything back,” Ezzell said. “The bill also gives other towns and counties the opportunity to do the same thing in case they are faced with some other natural disaster as well.”
In order to enact the tax, local governments will have to adopt bonds and send them to the voters for approval. SB383 contains an emergency clause, which enacts the bill into law immediately.
Senate Bill 197 allows municipalities to purchase ambulances using bonds and allows the state to move money from the Emergency Medical Services Fund to the Department of Finance and Administration to pledge in repaying the loans, similar to the process to buy fire trucks.
Ambulances are often too expensive for small local governments to purchase outright, said New Mexico Municipal League, which lobbies on behalf of cities, in an analysis of the bill. A single ambulance often costs over $200,000.
SB197 goes into effect July 1.

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)Large utility companies and technology giants are among those that have shown interest in a proposal to restart a pair of failed nuclear reactors in South Carolina. But questions remain regarding if or how the state might ultimately get such a deal done.
It’s been roughly six months since a state nuclear advisory group first floated the idea of restarting construction on the partially built reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County. Since then, South Carolina’s state-owned power company received applications of interest from nearly 80 interested parties.
About half of those have the financial wherewithal to be considered viable bidders, said Steve Nance, Santee Cooper’s director of nuclear development and technical training.
“To say this thing went viral would be an understatement,” he told members of the governor’s Nuclear Advisory Council on Monday.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

Nance did not name specific companies but said five of the so-called “Magnificent 7” — influential tech companies that have shaped the stock market in recent years — are among respondents. Those companies include Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
The calls to study a potential V.C. Summer restart came amid what members of the advisory council have said is a nuclear resurgence in the country.
The poster child for this has been the remaining unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, where a second unit suffered its notorious partial meltdown in 1979. The facility’s owner has started the federal permitting process for a restart to power a Microsoft data center.
“I never in my life thought we would be using nuclear reactors like a portable generator,” Nance said, but that appears to be what is happening as tech companies seek to power a surge in new artificial intelligence data centers.
Nance said his team at Santee Cooper has “gussied up” the V.C. Summer reactor sites as best they can since opening it up to bids in January. The company has cut the grass, removed abandoned scrap iron, and pumped standing water out of tanks so visitors can get a better look.
Items such as control room panels have been safely stored but other parts remain exposed to the elements: “Trays, piping, some of that stuff left outside for eight years is junk and will have to be replaced,” he said.

Nance said eight groups have so far gone out on tours of the site.
Groups have until May 5 to formally express their interest in the project. After that, those still interested after getting a look at Santee Cooper’s books will submit a more detailed proposal.
Nance said the initial thought is that Santee Cooper would sell the reactors outright in a cash sale to a buyer.
“But it’s not 100% that’s going to be the case,” he said.
Nance also said there are several groups that initially expressed interest but then backed out after learning more about the scope of work necessary.
Revival will not be without its challenges.
While more than 80% of the parts necessary to complete the reactors — one of which is about half built, the other about a quarter — are on site, some of it is already under sales contracts.
For example, some of the nuclear reactor components are promised to projects in the Ukraine, though the buyer has yet to pick up the pieces, and those contracts could expire if no move is made by the buyers to have them shipped out.
“The more questions that were asked, the less clear it became to me about what the next steps are,” said Tom Clements, a long-time critic of the V.C. Summer expansion who has warned against a potential reboot.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Santee Cooper has not yet publicly provided a cost estimate for a restart. Nor have federal regulators set guidelines for what it will take to re-establish that the unused parts are qualified for nuclear use, Clements said.
“They did not present anything that would make the project more viable,” Clements said. “This is going to be a very heavy left. There may be excitement about this but I’m still very skeptical.”
Sen. Tom Young, who sits on the advisory council, had questions about what criteria Santee Cooper planned to use to assess bidders and how the state would ensure any deal provides relief to utility customers who have been paying for billions in debt from the failed nuclear project on their monthly power bill.
“There are a lot of details that are going to have to be worked out,” the Aiken Republican told the SC Daily Gazette. “At the end of day, there’s going to have to be real scrutiny of any proposal.”

State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ administration developed the standards, which dictate what public schools must teach in social studies classes, along with committees of Oklahoma teachers and a group of national right-wing media personalities and policy advocates. The proposed standards would require education on the Bible, Jesus and alleged “discrepancies” in the 2020 presidential election.
Rejecting the proposed standards in full would send them back to the Oklahoma State Board of Education, which approved them on Feb. 27, for revisions. The Republican supermajority in the House and Senate would have to agree to the denial.
Leaders of the minority party said the process that produced the new standards was riddled with political interference.

Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, said lawmakers and the state Board of Education should take a slow, methodical approach “where everyone has their questions answered and parents feel comfortable” with the results.
“We need to slow down and take time and get this right,” Provenzano said.
One newly appointed state Board of Education member, Ryan Deatherage, said during the board’s Feb. 27 meeting that he didn’t have enough time to read through the standards before voting on them. 
It later came to light that the Oklahoma State Department of Education made changes to the proposed standards without revealing them publicly, including the addition of language questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Walters responded to the Democrats on Monday by accusing them of promoting “radical gender ideologies and anti-American agendas” instead of supporting “the core truths of America’s history and values.”

“We’re not surprised that Democrats are relentlessly undermining our children’s education,” he said in a statement. 
The state Legislature has 30 legislative days after the state board submits the academic standards to approve, amend or reject them, according to Oklahoma law. 
Legislative staff determined the 30-day deadline is May 1, said Jennifer Monies, a spokesperson for the House Speaker’s Office.
If lawmakers take no action by the deadline, the proposed standards would take effect as written, according to state law. If the Legislature rejects the standards, then Oklahoma’s current standards, which were established in 2019, would remain in place until the new version is approved.
Republican leaders in both chambers have yet to take a stance on Walters’ proposal. 
Walters met with House Republicans in a caucus meeting Monday, the Speakers’ Office confirmed.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said last week he invited Walters to the closed-door meeting to discuss the social studies standards. Hilbert said House Republicans then would deliberate as a caucus and with the Senate on what action, if any, is necessary.
The state reviews and enacts new academic standards for school subjects every six years. Hilbert said the state Legislature has never changed or rejected academic standards before.
“Before making the decision, I think it’s appropriate for the state superintendent to have a chance to make his pitch to our caucus,” Hilbert said.

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden unveiled a proposal Monday that would give counties the option to implement a half-percent sales tax to fund property tax reductions for homeowners.
Rhoden said the plan could save hundreds of dollars annually for typical homeowners in some areas. Counties that opt-in to the plan would shift some of their residential property tax burden to consumers, he said, including tourists from elsewhere making purchases while they pass through.
“Realistically, it’s a tax decrease for the citizens of the state,” Rhoden said.
The plan would alter longstanding taxation policy that reserves sales tax revenue for the state and cities. The state imposes a 4.2% sales tax that’s scheduled to increase to 4.5% in 2027, and cities may impose up to an additional 2% local rate, plus another 1% on hospitality-related items such as alcoholic beverages, restaurant meals, lodging accommodations and various types of events.
Rhoden signs property tax relief bill with eye toward another solution

The governor said he’ll send his proposal to a summer legislative committee studying property taxes, and he doesn’t anticipate action on the plan until next winter’s annual legislative session.
It’s the second property tax relief idea Rhoden has proposed since becoming governor in January, after the departure of Kristi Noem to serve in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.
The first idea, already signed into law, is a multifaceted effort that includes a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments, plus other provisions such as an eligibility expansion for an assessment freeze program for elderly and disabled people. 
As described by the governor, the new plan would allow county commissions to impose the sales tax. County citizens could refer the commission decision to local ballots, or petition the tax increase onto the ballot themselves.
Revenue from the sales tax would have to be used to offset the county’s portion of property taxes on owner-occupied homes. Once that’s fully achieved, any remaining revenue would have to be used to offset taxes for commercial and agricultural property. The sales tax would be limited to a five-year term, with the possibility of renewal.
The plan would not affect school districts, which also receive property tax revenue.
The governor said that in Minnehaha and Pennington counties, the proposal would reduce annual property taxes by $967 and $917, respectively, on a home valued at $325,000. Those are the two most-populated counties in the state, home to Sioux Falls and Rapid City.

Rhoden said counties that attract lots of tourists are also some of the counties most affected by property tax increases, in part due to growth from incoming residents willing to pay higher prices for the limited number of houses on the market. Thus, Rhoden said, those counties are particularly well-suited for his plan.
He said the lack of county-specific targeting was a problem with many of the property tax relief proposals that failed during the legislative session.
“They were proposing a statewide solution to a five-county problem,” Rhoden said.
Asked whether the plan might place a greater burden on low-income residents who pay sales taxes but rent their homes and do not directly benefit from property tax reductions, Rhoden acknowledged the concern. But he said the ultimate decision would rest with local officials and voters.
“Every county has different circumstances,” he said.
Rep. Mike Derby, R-Rapid City, who co-chairs the Legislature’s main budget committee, said lawmakers are excited to see the governor put a proposal on the table. 
“Around here in the Legislature, you have to start with an idea,” Derby said. “And it’s a lot easier to poke holes in an idea or try and fix it or make it better when you have a starting point. Governor Rhoden has done that.”
The plan would result in the following estimated annual property tax savings on a $325,000 home in cities within selected counties, according to the Governor’s Office: 

Minnehaha (Sioux Falls): $967
Pennington (Rapid City): $917
Custer (Custer): $431
Hughes (Pierre): $873
Lawrence (Spearfish): $845
Lincoln (Tea): $613

Brown/Maryland Matters)What started as a day to recognize the state’s transgender community spun into pointed criticism of the Moore administration’s and state lawmakers’ failure to protect against Trump administration actions that affect the day-t0-day lives of transgender individuals.
The topic of transgender issues later spilled out into a debate on the House floor, reflecting a tumultuous time for transgender people even in the so-called “safe haven” that is Maryland.
The tension began Monday morning at an International Transgender Day of Visibility event hosted by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in the State House. During his remarks, he promised that transgender Marylanders will continue to be protected in the even as President Donald Trump (R) signals hostility towards the community.
“We are proud to be a safe haven for people of all backgrounds and identities, and I want to be very clear, this is a reputation that we intend on keeping,” he said, highlighting policies in recent years that help support LGBTQ+ veterans and grant better access to gender-affirming care.

But to Lee Blinder — a nonbinary official who chairs the Maryland Commission on LGBTQIA+ Affairs in the Governor’s Office — those promises have fallen flat.
“We know who you, Governor Moore, can be for us,” Blinder said as Moore stood nearby, “and I am here begging you to do it.
“It will not get easier to support trans people. It will not get easier to commit to this community, it will only get harder in the days that come,” Blinder said.
Blinder criticized what they called the administration’s lack of support to protect the community amid federal measures to diminish the presence of transgender people in day-to-day life.
Blinder noted that bills impacting the LGBTQ+ community are not moving this session — including Senate Bill 314, the Birth Certificate Modernization Act, which would make it easier for transgender people to make changes to their birth certificates, among other measures.
They also said more state dollars should be going towards the transgender community, even as lawmakers discuss billions in cuts to state programs and more than $1 billion in new revenue increases to address a fiscal 2026 budget shortfall.
“We’re facing one of the most dangerous threats to trans lives across the country, and the trans community is nowhere to be found in here with this budget, so now I must beg,” Blinder said. “I’ll beg in private; I’ll beg in public. I’ll do absolutely whatever it takes to get my community what we need.”
Moore did not directly respond to the criticism at the event and did not take questions from press. He wrapped up by declaring March 31 Transgender Day of Visibility in the state, has he as done each year during his term.
The governor’s office later reiterated Moore’s commitment to be a safe haven for the transgender community, pointing to policies that include increased funding for hate crime prevention in fiscal 2026 and providing Medicaid access to gender-affirming health care resources.
Legislation boosts Maryland’s rating with LGBTQ+ policy tracking think tank

“We are proud of our work so far, but our administration knows we have so much more to do – and we will do it together in partners,” the statement said.
Following the morning event, Blinder said that the governor’s compassion for the transgender community is “not in question.” But Blinder felt a duty to speak up.
“This is a desperate time, and we are in a state of emergency,” they said. “This community is in crisis, and they are relying on me. So, I have to do a difficult thing and share an honest report with the governor, we really deserve and need that protection.”
Delegates face off on trans issues
The fight over transgender issues continued onto the House floor later Monday.
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) stood to recognize National Woman’s History Month by speaking in support of Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who tied with transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas in the NCAA championship in 2022.
Gaines’ experience is cited by those pushing for policies that ban transgender women from women’s sports, arguing that they have inherent strengths and unfair advantages against cisgender women.
“Women accomplish in sports and they stand on their own. As women, we are competitive and resilient and determined. We were created with unique strengths, very different from men, and we should never be able to blur those truths,” Szeliga said to applause and whistles of approval. “Riley Gaines has inspired many other girls and women to speak up. She has faced threats, violence and hatred … but she keeps showing up for girls in sports.”
International Transgender Day of Visibility always falls on March 31, which also happens to be the last day of National Women’s History Month. Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) shot back against Szeliga’s “unfortunate” comments and brought the conversation back to Transgender Day of Visibility.

“It’s a day to celebrate the lives and contributions that trans people bring to every single region of this country, every single region to this state,” he said. “Trans women are women – they deserve the same respect, kindness and compassion as every other woman in this country.”
He said transgender individuals “are veterans, they are hardworking employees, they are people who contribute to our society, they sit on the boards of our non-profits, they work in our schools, they help our families, and they support their own families. And they have to suffer through the indignity of having to sit here and be erased on this floor. I will not stand for it.”
“I say to all the trans people out there in Maryland listening to us right now – Happy Trans Day of Visibility. We love you, we see you, we affirm you,” Fair concluded, as many of the Democratic members stood to applaud.
After the floor session, Fair said he wanted to “correct the record” and affirm “that trans people are very important to our society.”
“Unfortunately, one of my colleagues felt it necessary to use today as a political football, and then trash transgender people, disrespect them on the floor,” he said.
As to Blinder’s comments, Fair agreed that the House is struggling to pass some of the LGBTQ+ bills this session, but he said Maryland is still “light years ahead of other states” in supporting transgender and the LGBTQ+ population.
“I hear the chair’s comments. And I agree we can always be doing more, always … Maryland is at the upper echelon of protections for transgender people and for LGBTQ+ people,” he said, “but that never means that we’ve done enough, there’s more to do.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_march31_blindermoore_transvis-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 19:04:36.436742

But most voters likely wouldn’t know that just by reading the drafted ballot language. 
The Republican-backed amendment, if passed out of the legislature and approved by voters, would outlaw abortion with limited exceptions for medical emergencies and survivors of rape and incest prior to 12 weeks gestation.
The amendment seeks to overturn an abortion-rights amendment approved by voters in November that legalize abortions up until the point of fetal viability. This made Missouri the first state to overturn an abortion ban after lawmakers enacted a trigger law in 2022 that banned the procedure with exceptions only for medical emergencies. 
While the proposed ballot language would ask voters if they want to repeal Article I, Section 36 of the constitution —the current abortion-rights amendment — it does not directly ask voters if they want to ban or outlaw most abortions.
Instead, it would ask voters if they want to “guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages,” a right that is already guaranteed under the current constitutional amendment. 
Missourians would also be asked if they want to “ensure women’s safety during abortion,” “ensure parental consent for minors,” allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape and incest” and “protect children from gender transitions.”
If approved by both the House and Senate, Missourians could be asked to weigh in on reinstating an abortion ban as soon as a special election the governor could call this year, or during the 2026 midterm election. 
The legislation approved by a House committee Monday, is the second iteration of legislation filed by state Rep. Melanie Stinnett, a Republican from Springfield. 
Stinnett’s initial language included a criticized police reporting requirement for survivors of sexual violence. Two out of every three sexual assaults are not reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
That requirement was removed in Monday’s version. 
Missouri health department rejects Planned Parenthood plan to start medication abortions

On Thursday, House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican from Lee’s Summit, said while he anticipates the GOP will continue to refine the exact language to put before voters, he doesn’t foresee the rape and incest exceptions being cut out in later debate. 
“That’s something that the people spoke on,” Patterson said. “That’s something that all the legislators recognize is something that we have to keep.”
The new legislation, like its predecessor, proposes a ban on gender-affirming health care for minors. It also seeks to reinstate state regulations on abortion providers and facilities, including admitting privileges at a local hospital, licensing requirements and inspections. 
The amendment would allow abortions in cases of fetal anomaly, which the legislation defines as “a structural or functional abnormality in the unborn child’s gestational development that would make life outside the womb impossible.” 
The bill specifies that this would include ectopic pregnancies but exclude a fetal diagnosis of a disability. 
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, raised concerns with this language on Monday. She questioned how the amendment would apply to a fetal diagnosis where a newborn could survive birth, but would die shortly after, including in cases of anencephaly, a fetal birth defect in which part of the brain or skull don’t develop properly. 
The new proposal also looks to require that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. 
After the abortion-rights amendment passed in November, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, arguing several abortion regulations on the books were now unconstitutional. That case is being tried in Jackson County, where one of the state’s several Planned Parenthood clinics is located. 
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has been unable to convince the judge to move the case to Cole County, where a judge last year attempted to remove the abortion-rights amendment from the ballot.
During Monday’s hearing, state Rep. Pattie Mansur, a Democrat from Kansas City, said she found it noteworthy that in Missouri, a 17-year-old girl could be legally married but would still need permission from her parents for an abortion. 
The House Committee on Children and Families previously spent four hours debating the initial bill, including testimony from Missourians who accused lawmakers of attempting to overturn the will of the people.
Republicans have continued to defend their decision to spend much of the legislative session on an abortion amendment by arguing that Missourians were misinformed on what they were voting on in November — a reasoning that continues to draw fury from abortion-right supporters both in the legislature and in their districts. 
“The most disappointing piece of that is the Republican’s consistent insistence on defying the will of the voters in this state,” House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, told reporters last week. “Whether it’s on abortion or paid sick leave and minimum wage, the first order of business this year has been to undo what Missourians went to the ballot box to vote for.”
Aune also took notice of how late into session the proposed amendment was making its way out of committee. 
“It seems to me that the reason this has been slow rolled is that there simply is not consensus on the other side of the aisle on what language to end up with, how far to go or not, what they think that they can get passed by the voters or not,” Aune said Thursday. “That is likely causing a lot of contention in their caucus right now, and I’m not mad about that.”
But there didn’t seem to be much disagreement come Monday between GOP members of the House Committee on Children and Families who passed the revised language after just a few minutes of discussion. 
“It was time to get this moving,” state Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka who chairs the committee, told her colleagues Monday. 
The Senate version of the legislation, sponsored by state Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St Charles, passed out of committee in early March but has yet to be heard on the Senate floor. 
Abortion within the state remains out of reach for many Missourians, despite voters in November codifying the right to reproductive health care in the state constitution. 
This includes the most common type of abortion. Medication abortions remain inaccessible through Planned Parenthood in Missouri after the state rejected complication plans submitted by the clinics outlining continued care for patients in the case they had any adverse effects from the medication. 
The rejection notice sent by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services was based on criteria set in an emergency rule published Thursday by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office that included a requirement that clinics must provide the names of any physicians who prescribe abortion medication. 
In response, Planned Parenthood on Friday filed a motion asking that a Jackson County judge block the state statute that requires the clinics submit an abortion medication plan. As of Monday, three Planned Parenthood clinics — in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis — had started seeing some patients for procedural abortions again.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The town of Johnston’s attempt to seize 31 acres of land is no longer being considered in state court after both parties requested the matter get tossed.
Providence County Superior Court Judge Christopher Smith dismissed the town’s condemnation action, leaving the case solely in U.S. District Court, where the landowners are suing Johnston officials over what their attorneys call a “sham taking” of the property.
“We shouldn’t have had to go through this to begin with,” Providence attorney Kelley Morris Salvatore said in an interview while leaving the Licht Judicial Complex. “And now the case is going to proceed where it always should have.”
SCLS Realty, LLC, and Sixty Three Johnston, LLC, had plans to build a 252-unit affordable housing complex on the site. But Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. wants to build a new public safety complex and town hall on the site.
Polisena said he remains confident the town will come out on top in its bid to take the land.
“We continue to believe the town has acted correctly on behalf of the taxpayers of Johnston and now we look forward to addressing the matter solely in federal court,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Johnston’s Town Council authorized Polisena to legally seize the property off George Waterman Road by eminent domain. Under Rhode Island General Law, eminent domain can be used to remove hazardous buildings, revitalize abandoned lots, and clarify land ownership. Municipalities typically reserve the legal tool for road projects.
Attorneys representing the property’s owners argue that the seizure was pretextual, claiming Polisena decided to use eminent domain only after making multiple public declarations against the project.
Two days after developers filed their federal lawsuit, the town briefly gained ownership of the land after filing a petition and depositing $775,000 into the court’s registry, the assessed value of the site. But the town was ordered to change the land records back to developers Ralph Santoro and Salvatore Compagnone, who said the seizure was done without notice to them or their lawyers.
That same afternoon as the initial ruling, U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose issued a temporary restraining order pausing the town’s efforts to seize the land for 30 days.
With the case no longer in state court, the $775,000 deposited by the town will return to its account pending the final outcome of the federal court case, Polisena’s Deputy Chief of Staff Dominique Turner said in an email Monday.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Four months after Florida Supreme Court Justice Carlos Muñiz blasted the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) for not providing enough information to justify a public utility rate increase, the chairman of the PSC attempted to defend his agency before a Senate committee on Monday.
The PSC is a five-member board appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate that is responsible for facilitating safe and reliable utility services at fair prices. According to its own website, the commission “must balance the needs of a utility and its shareholders with the needs of consumers.”
Mike La Rosa, the sitting PSC Chair who was initially appointed to serve on the Commission by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2021, came before the Senate Ethics & Election Committee seeking conformation to another four-year term.
Northeast GOP Sen. Jennifer Bradley asked him to respond to the thrust of Muñiz comments, expressed in December as the court heard arguments in an appeal of a 2023 PSC order approving rates for Florida City Gas. The Chief Justice criticized the PSC for not providing nearly enough information to justify a rate increase, after the PSC’s own staff recommended that they not approve the increase.
‘Black Box’
“The PSC is a black box,” Muñiz said in comments reported by the News Service of Florida.
“That is my problem with these cases. It’s a black box. And administrative procedure is not supposed to be [a black box]. It’s supposed to be the opposite of a black box. That’s the only justification for this whole mousetrap is to have reasoned explanations for fact-based decisions. And, instead, we get a regurgitation of the evidence and then like, ‘Oh, because so-and-so said this, we think that this is appropriate. We’re done.’ That is literally every order that we see from the PSC.”
“That is an alarming statement for me as a legislator to hear from our chief justice of our Florida Supreme Court,” Bradley said Monday.
La Rosa replied that while he couldn’t explain why the PSC didn’t provide more information in their orders in the past, that began changing in 2023 (he began serving as chair of the commission that November).
“Our chairman at the time, I think, guided us down the right path to make sure that our legal staff responded in a way that satisfied and frankly provided a better product of what the Supreme Court is looking for,” La Rosa said. 
He added that commission orders have been of a higher quality ever since. But he said he could not defend why earlier orders were written the way they were. He also said that since that time the commissioners have stepped up their public comments from the dais during rate hike hearings, as well.
Broward County Democratic Sen. Mack Bernard asked why the PSC wasn’t providing the Supreme Court with meaningful information. La Rosa said he couldn’t really provide an “answer that’s satisfactory.” He added “that they should always have had the backup and the history and the depth of knowledge that we currently have.”
Committee Chairman Don Gates quoted another part of Muñiz’s comments, that “the Public Service Commission appeared to rely largely on what utilities told them, ‘as opposed to any facts and evidence.'” Gaetz asked whether La Rosa could give two or three examples of the last time his commission turned down a utility rate increase.
La Rosa countered that there wasn’t a single case he could remember when the PSC approved what the utility was exactly asking for.
“There are elements what the company is asking for that we do approve, but there are certain modifications that we make after we litigate and after we make the case,” he said, adding that he couldn’t remember the last time a public utility made a request that the PSC granted exactly.
Gaetz cited criticism that he has heard that utilities start out by asking for extraordinarily high rate increases that they expect won’t be approved, but use as leverage to bargain to get the rate increase that they really coveted.
“That might be what the company is asking for, but it also may not be,” La Rosa responded.
Gaetz is sponsoring a bill this session (SB 354) to tighten PSC requirements for deciding the return on equity levels to which utilities are entitled. Miami-Dade County Republican Bryan Avila asked La Rosa whether the commission factors in potential compensation, benefits, or bonuses for utility  executives.
“Probably every single time,” La Rosa said.
The committee ultimately unanimously approved La Rosa’s confirmation to serve on the PSC for another four years, but not before both Bradley and Gaetz both got a last word in.
“This was a situation that really was a black eye and I want to make sure that going forward that’s not the case,” Bradley said. “That, going forward, things are different.”
PSC put on notice
Gaetz added that next year the PSC and the public will likely see legislation similar to what he proposed this year regarding how much investor-owned public utilities can earn. “If you see it, it will be based on the commission’s performance between now and next year. And if the commission was a little troubled by the legislation this year, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”
Last December wasn’t the first time the Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice has bashed the PSC for what he said were inadequate orders. In 2023, he questioned whether the commission had adequately justified the approval of a 2021 legal settlement that increased base electric rates for Florida Power & Light.
“There’s no explanation whatsoever for the PSC’s thinking on how it got to approving this,” Muñiz said at the time.
“From a judicial review perspective and from a matter of the PSC complying with its obligations, how can the order not address the major issues that are in dispute in a way that allows us to kind of have a window into what the rational process was that led to the finding that it was in the public interest?”
La Rosa will ultimately need to be confirmed by the entire Senate to stay on for another four-year term.

Rhode Island’s state health department lost roughly $31.2 million in unspent federal grants after President Donald Trump’s administration initiated a sweeping removal of pandemic-era subsidies last week.  
Rhode Island’s Congressional Delegation is not too happy about the cuts, which affect four health department programs in the Ocean State. While the grants funding these programs originated in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) enlarged the grants’ purpose over time, and the money supported state efforts centered around vaccination, pandemic readiness and infectious disease surveillance. 
“This funding was critical to saving lives and keeping the health care system afloat in unprecedented circumstances,” the state’s congressional delegates wrote in a letter released Friday. “It would be pennywise and pound-foolish to claw back the federal investment in this work.” 
U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo signed the letter imploring U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose agency is responsible for the CDC, to undo the cuts.
The letter came three days after the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) learned that, like many other states, it would lose grant funding related to COVID-era programs. Joseph Wendelken, a health department spokesperson, said via email Monday that there was no news from the federal government since last week. 
Wendelken said the cuts would affect four programs funded by CDC grants:

Rhode Island Immunization and Vaccines for Children, set to end on June 30. 
Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity work, set to end on July 31, 2026.
Rhode Island Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities, set to end on May 31. 
Rhode Island Community Health Workers for COVID Response and Resilient Communities, set to end on Aug. 30.

Some of the money from these programs has already been spent, so the $31 million represents the remaining unspent balance. These programs, Wendelken wrote, help constitute “the public health infrastructure that surrounds vaccination in Rhode Island,” including services like vaccination clinics, monitoring and outbreak responses for contagious diseases and foodborne illnesses, and core laboratory functions at state health department laboratories.   
The office of Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is also concerned about the funds being yanked away.
“The clawback of funds that had already been allocated to Rhode Island is very concerning,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement. “Our legal team is digging into this matter further and working with both RIDOH and the Attorney General’s Office to discuss the State’s options.”
  Dr. Jerome ‘Jerry’ Larkin, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, testifies before a subcommittee of the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance during a routine, annual hearing on the department’s budget on March 25, 2025. Larkin was confirmed as the agency’s head less than a year ago. ‘We certainly live in interesting times. In the last two months, we’ve had a period of great flux,’ Larkin told lawmakers.

Job losses, lower immunization rates predicted
The bad news first arrived to state lawmakers during a presentation at the Rhode Island State House last week. Each year, the House Committee on Finance holds hearings on the many sections of the governor’s proposed budget, with Finance subcommittees listening to testimony from each state agency and department about its needs for the upcoming fiscal year.   
But the health department did not have good news to relay to state representatives to the finance subcommittee on Human Services on March 25. Chantale Sarrasin, principal legislative budget analyst for the House Fiscal Advisory Staff, was the bearer of bad news.
“The department was notified today that remaining COVID-19 grant funds are targeted for federal recapture,” Sarrasin told the subcommittee during her presentation on the governor’s proposed $292 million budget for the department in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The state health department has received about $410 million in CDC grants since the pandemic began in 2020, Sarrasin said, and the unspent COVID money is equivalent to about 10% of the department’s overall budget. 
But the subcommittee Chair and Democratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi of South Kingstown was most curious about the term “recaptured,” making air quotes when she repeated the phrase back to Sarrasin.   
“That’s a new word for me,” Tanzi said, asking about how that money comprised 10% of the department budget.
Sarrasin deferred to Dr. Jerome ‘Jerry’ Larkin, the health department’s director, who then took his seat before the subcommittee to testify. 
“I would not say ‘recaptured,’” Larkin said, then chuckled. “That’s their term, I think this has to be properly understood as planning for the future. It is not really related to COVID in terms of a direct response to the pandemic. It is related to COVID because we are preparing for the next pandemic with this money. So I think a recapture or looting of this money really represents a misguided attempt at getting money back and stopping us from doing what we are supposed to be doing.”
Tanzi asked what the loss of money would affect, and Larkin said there would be a direct impact on staffing, with up to 57 employees and their jobs possibly affected. The same could also be said for contractors and community partners who work with the state, Larkin added.
But the department was still unclear as to the true extent. “We’re working to understand the implications of all this,” Larkin said. 

The doctor was more willing to make a prediction when Tanzi asked if the cuts could drive immunization rates lower.
“It would certainly probably drive immunization rates lower,” Larkin said. “It’s hard to understand exactly how much lower…It’s not going to make anything better.”
The Senate confirmed Larkin as head of the health department last May, and he told the House subcommittee that he watched the budget hearings from last year to get a sense of how budget initiatives did — or didn’t — work out.  
“I guess now I know, I’ll keep that to myself for now,” Larkin told lawmakers. “This has certainly been one of the more complex positions I’ve ever held, and it certainly is a position I’m holding in a very complex time.”
Larkin returned to the State House two days after the finance subcommittee, this time to speak with the Senate Committee on Finance. He brought with him a new presentation that included slides on the cancelled grants announced two days earlier. Rhode Island’s high vaccination rates, he told senators, could be harmed by the lost funding. He also said the state and its congressional delegates are communicating with grant managers at CDC and HHS, as well as the leaders of health departments in other states who are going through the same process.    
Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, asked Larkin how the feds communicated their selection of which grants to cancel. 
 The justification, Larkin explained, was technical. 
“In the grants, there’s this wild card term that says that the grant can be terminated for cause. The cause they invoked was that the pandemic was over,” Larkin said.  “It’s not really COVID money. It’s COVID response money. It’s a response to a situation.”

“We got a lot of change coming up, and I’m being forthright and honest with you about that, but at the end of the day, it’s putting the veteran first and making sure you get the care that you’ve earned and the care and the benefits that you have,” Collins said, during a visit to American Legion Post 141 alongside U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) on Monday.

“As they always say, motion causes friction. There’s going to be a lot of friction. There’s a lot of invested parties in keeping the VA, just like it is, the only investment I have is in you to make it better,” Collins said. 
During his visit, Collins told reporters that despite added funding and personnel, the department hadn’t improved in providing services to veterans.
As it looks to reduce its workforce, Collins said they were looking at areas that did not deal directly with veterans’ benefits or healthcare. The Department is currently assessing its agencies to determine whether its agents are performing well, where they need help and what they do not need, he said. 
The Department has added more than 80,000 employees since the 2019 fiscal year, including tens of thousands of employees hired to address claims under the 2022 PACT ACT claims, which expanded benefits to veterans exposed to burn pits. However, Collins told the crowd nobody could tell him how many employees were hired in support of the law. 
“We were hiring interior designers. We’re hiring laborers. We were hiring publicists,” Collins said. 
“We have a lot of employees in the VA that are not seeing patients. They’re not doing disability claims. They’re not doing that. They’re moving paperwork. And so we’re gonna see if someone would like to be reintroduced to a clinic and actually help patients on their daily basis,” Collins said.

However, that reduction of 80,000 positions is a goal, Collins said. While they may not get there, Collins said he made “very much of a commitment.” 
While the Department aims to cut tens of thousands of employees by August, Democrats, veterans and unions have raised concerns about how they will impact veterans, protesting nearby the Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Ann Arbor.
According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) on Saturday pushed back on the Trump Administration’s cuts and the president’s move to invalidate bargaining agreements with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing VA employees. 
“This commitment to cut 80,000 people out of the Veterans Administration means veterans’ health care can be cut, veterans’ access to services and benefits are going to be cut,” Gilchrist told the Free Press. “The fundamental promise of being a servicewoman or a serviceman, that’s being broken.”
Earlier this month, Barrett sent a letter to Collins calling on the VA to “review and reconsider their workforce reduction process to ensure only those who have truly underperformed are relieved of duty.”
When asked if his concerns had been addressed, Barrett deflected, telling reporters he was excited the secretary had come to visit his district and was committed to his mission of improving the VA. 
“I think you heard from his remarks today the commitment that he has, and I’m excited to be working with him in that effort to make sure that we continue, as he said. The purpose of this is to deliver the benefits that our veterans have earned, and to do that respectfully. And that’s the mission that I’m committed to as well. And look forward to working with him in that effort,” Barrett said.
Collins similarly deflected when asked how many employees had been fired and rehired as after two federal judges ordered the White House to reinstate more than 24,000 probationary employees let go across 18 government agencies. 

“We’re following the courts’ orders,” he said.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)No one knew exactly how President Donald Trump’s first-day order halting new offshore wind leases would affect the federal approvals already granted for the SouthCoast Wind project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
More than two months later, uncertainty still hangs over the 147-turbine wind farm. Which is why SouthCoast Wind and utility companies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts announced Monday a three-month extension to finish contract negotiations — the same day final contracts were set to be executed.
“The multi-state negotiations have been complex and ambitious; now they must also tackle uncertainty presented by federal policy,” Rebecca Ullman, a SouthCoast Wind spokesperson, said in an emailed statement on Monday. SouthCoast Wind is grateful for the continued collaboration with our Massachusetts and Rhode Island partners.” 
The new June 30 deadline marks the third delay since Rhode Island and Massachusetts jointly unveiled plans in September to buy power from SouthCoast Wind following a competitive, tri-state solicitation that included Connecticut. The bulk of the power from SouthCoast’s 1,287 megawatts of “nameplate capacity” — 1,087 megawatts — would go to Massachusetts under tentative contracts with its utility companies. Rhode Island Energy was set to buy the remaining 200 megawatts of wind-powered electricity to deliver to the Ocean State’s electric grid.
The contracts lock in these commitments, and also set the price per-megawatt hour that utility companies agree to pay to the developer.  
Supply chain snafus and inflationary pressures have driven up developer costs, prompting some companies, including SouthCoast, to renege on existing pricing agreements in hopes of a more lucrative deal. That, in turn, has put more pressure on utility companies — and ratepayers — to cover their rising expenses. 
A prior attempt by Rhode Island Energy in 2023 to buy more offshore wind power was canceled after the only submission, from Danish wind giant Ørsted A/S, was deemed too expensive relative to environmental and economic benefits. 
Rough seas worsened after the November election, with Trump’s vocal anti-wind sentiment creating alarm for states that already set mandates to bring in offshore wind power.

SouthCoast parent company was ready for delays 
Ocean Winds, the European parent company of SouthCoast Wind, told investors last month it was slashing the value of its North American portfolio by €267 million (equal to $275 million) to account for delays in its three U.S. wind farms, including SouthCoast.
Company executives stressed that the writedown was a “precautionary measure” tied to federal uncertainty under the Trump administration. At most, they projected a four-year delay in completion of the SouthCoast Wind project.
Construction on SouthCoast Wind was originally slated to begin in 2026, delivering power to the electric grid by the end of the decade. The project has already received its requisite environmental and construction plan federal approvals under the Biden administration.
Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, alluded to federal political headwinds slowing contract negotiations in a statement Monday.
“The utilities and developers continue their hard work to negotiate and memorialize the bids in binding contracts,” Diggin said in an emailed response Monday. “Federal policy is an important factor in these projects and the parties are working to gain greater certainty before finalizing the contracts.”
Robert Beadle, a spokesperson for Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment about Trump’s executive order, but said the agency “remains in communication” regarding the SouthCoast Wind contract.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment on Monday.










The multi-state negotiations have been complex and ambitious; now they must also tackle uncertainty presented by federal policy.


– Rebecca Ullman, a SouthCoast Wind spokesperson


Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat whose district includes the proposed underwater cable route for SouthCoast Wind, hoped the latest contract extension would bring more clarity to how federal policy affects already permitted wind projects.
“It’s hard to make concrete decisions in an environment where there’s so much uncertainty,” McGaw said in an interview Monday. “If this was a new application, we know exactly where this would lie, but because they are so far along in the process, there is more of a question.”
Rhode Island’s economic and environmental future hinges on its stake in the wind industry. Offshore wind is critical to meeting the state’s decarbonization mandates under the Act on Climate Law. A single offshore wind project like the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project under construction south of Block Island, can offset over 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year — just shy of 10% of the gross greenhouse gas emissions tracked from Rhode Island in 2022. 
“The long-term benefits of offshore wind remain critical to our region, and we must recognize that the current economic and market uncertainty presents a challenge to the industry,” said Amanda Barker, clean energy program coordinator at Green Energy Consumers Alliance and the Rhode Island state lead for New England for Offshore Wind. “While patience is critical in navigating today’s landscape, we know that the states and developers are dedicated to our shared climate, economic, and energy independence goals and we need to find a way to get these projects over the finish line as soon as feasible.”
Wind power offers a more stable supply of electricity compared with natural gas too — top-of-mind for McGaw on the heels of another winter plagued by volatile spikes in electricity bills for Rhode Islanders.
“We’ve been reading and hearing so much from constituents who are frustrated with their utility bills,” McGaw said. “So much of that is related to an unstable fossil fuel market.”
Yet public perception of offshore wind remains divided.
Nearly 6 in 10 Rhode Islanders surveyed as part of a 2024 Rhode Island Current poll conducted by MassInc Polling Group supported offshore wind, compared with 34% of those who disapproved. But among the state’s registered Democrats, support grew to a decisive 68%, while 6 in 10 registered Republicans disapproved.

Nantucket challenges federal review 
On Thursday, the town of Nantucked filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in D.C. against the federal agencies that approved the SouthCoast Wind project, contending that the yearslong environmental review of the project was flawed.
Matt Fee, vice chair of the Nantucket Select Board, said in a statement that the lawsuit was about protecting the island’s economy, which depends on “heritage tourism.”
“This is not about protecting rich people’s views,” Fee said.
However, Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island chapter of AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, disagreed.
“Nantucket is not known for its embracing of working-class culture,” Crowley said in an interview. “It’s the playground of the rich and famous.”
Ocean Winds’ Brown defended the federal review of its project in a statement Monday.
“BOEM conducted a rigorous environmental and historic preservation review process, which began in 2021,” Brown said. “Nantucket and its representatives were active participants throughout the entire process. We remain very confident in the thoroughness of the federal review and will continue to monitor the situation closely.” Crowley remains a vocal supporter of offshore wind because of the opportunities it presents for union workers who can help build and service wind projects across the region. He wasn’t troubled by delays in SouthCoast Wind contract negotiations, nor the looming threat of the Trump administration.
“As long as it gets built, and it gets built using my members, that’s the important thing,” Crowley said.
Assuming Rhode Island Energy completes contract negotiations by June 30, the proposed pricing agreement and estimated revenue would be submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission by Aug. 25, according to an updated timeline on the state’s wind procurement website. Utility regulators have final authority over long-term renewable energy contracts under state law.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)Washington state senators revealed a proposal Monday to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of culverts blocking the migration of salmon and other fish. 
The plan included in the Senate’s capital budget would bond up to $5 billion over the next 15 years and repay the debt with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities.
That’s at least how much lawmakers believe the state still needs to fully fund culvert removals in light of a decades-spanning court case in which a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the state had violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights. 
The judge ordered an injunction forcing the state to pay to correct its barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. In a tied vote in 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling. 
The goal has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
But last year, state officials told the judge overseeing the case they couldn’t meet that target, as projects have ballooned in cost and new culverts have been discovered. The one project that has gotten perhaps the most scrutiny could require buying a motel in Port Angeles to tear out the culvert beneath, to the tune of $100 million.
The agency estimates needing to deal with another 300 barriers to hit the 90% benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million, a transportation department spokesperson said Monday.
“We hope to be able to deliver those projects in different ways,” Sen. Marko Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, told reporters last week. “Maybe there’s some other way to deliver a repair up there that doesn’t lead to tearing down that motel.”
The tribes and the state entered confidential mediation this month in the court case to discuss a new path that recognizes the state’s limited resources.
“The state’s about to walk into mediation with the tribes with nothing,” said Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, a Democrat from Tacoma and the Senate’s lead capital budget writer. “We have an obligation by the state of Washington to tribes that we’re not meeting and unable to meet.”

In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, the state’s transportation department completed 32 fish barrier projects covered by the injunction that impacted over 67 miles of upstream habitat. In total, as of last June, transportation officials said they had restored 571 miles of habitat in work related to the court order.
State money for culvert projects has previously come through the separate transportation budget, but its balance sheet is facing a billion-dollar shortfall over the next two years and growing. So senators turned to the capital budget. 
The transportation budget from House Democrats unveiled last week did not include such a funding switch, instead earmarking more than $3.1 billion over the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination.
How to bridge the chambers’ diverging approaches, will be a “leadership call at the end of the day,” Trudeau said.
The Senate’s transportation budget, which passed off the floor Saturday, does still touch on culverts, aiming to expedite the permit review process for removals.
The Senate plan
A little over half of the state tax on electrical utilities, redirected to the Federal Injunction Salmon Habitat (or FISH, for short) account, would back the bonds proposed under Senate Bill 5804. 
Trudeau said the plan won’t impact ratepayers.
That tax revenue usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. Senators propose backfilling that with $150 million of other bonds.
Going into this legislative session, the expectation was that lawmakers would sweep that public works funding to pay for other things given the state’s budget shortfall, Trudeau said.
“We’re not decimating public works, which is what I think everybody anticipated out of this session,” she said. “But in fact, we’ve added more money.”
Republican lawmakers have pushed to use income from the state’s carbon auctions to pay for culvert removals, but Democrats haven’t budged on their belief that the money must go specifically to decarbonization efforts.
The approach announced Monday has bipartisan support, with two Republican senators signed on as cosponsors.
The bill is set for a public hearing Tuesday afternoon in the Ways and Means Committee. A vote on the Senate floor could come as soon as Saturday. 
The legislative session is scheduled to end April 27. The next biennial budget begins July 1.

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)Iowa’s education representatives say they are relieved that, at least for now, teachers and librarians don’t have to fear being fired under state law if they make a wrong decision about which books to keep on school shelves.
A judge last week placed a preliminary injunction against part of Senate File 496. The law, which the Iowa Legislature passed in 2023, prohibits school libraries from providing books deemed not age appropriate and primarily focuses on any book that includes “sex acts.”
Christy Hickman, general counsel for the Iowa State Education Association and representing ISEA as a plaintiff, said she was “incredibly relieved for our members.” Those members include educators at all levels. Teachers now “wouldn’t have to be concerned about their employment or their licensure being in jeopardy in the event they didn’t interpret this incredibly vague law incorrectly,” she said.

Some school districts, however, won’t be quick to change internal guidance on the law. “Given the number of injunctions and appeals, Southeast Polk is not taking any additional action with books at this time,” Jeannie Christenson, community relations coordinator at Southeast Polk Community School District, said. “We have not yet returned any of the removed titles to shelves, and we will continue to monitor legal developments.”
Federal District Judge Stephen Locher, in the Southern District of Iowa, had placed an injunction on SF 496 before, but the State of Iowa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit. The appeals court ruled Locher had not performed the correct “analysis” on the case and sent it back to Locher’s court. This time, Locher’s analysis weighed the unconstitutional applications of the law against the constitutional ones, which in his ruling he admitted is “hard to do” for this case.
Still, Locher ruled “the law has been unconstitutionally applied in dozens (if not hundreds) of situations and constitutionally applied in one.”
Locher wrote in his ruling that the law “places the burden on local school districts and school officials to determine whether a book is permitted” and that “this is the whole point of the law’s penalty provisions: local officials and districts are subject to punishment if they get it wrong.”
The law put educators in a “precarious state … by passing this bill and not giving them a lot of direction about how to carry it out,” Hickman said. “I don’t even know where I would start to explain the heaviness of that.”
A student plaintiff in the lawsuit calls the injunction a “huge step in the right direction.” Grace Van Gundy, a senior at Urbandale High School, and the only student in the lawsuit, said she wants her fellow students “to feel reassured about the injunction and remember that there are still government officials looking out for our best interests—even if it doesn’t always feel like it.”
She said the decision “solidifies the importance of education and that proves we will not tolerate attempts at censorship.”
Despite the ruling, Van Gundy believes that “there is still work to do. The fight is not over.”
Locher’s preliminary injunction could once again be appealed to the Eighth Circuit based on the new analysis of the law. Hickman said she expects the state will appeal.
If that’s the case, she said the appeals court will have “a very, very extensive decision with analysis of multiple different (legal) tests, so the Eighth Circuit will have a very fair record to make a final determination,” Hickman said.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird in a statement alluded to the state taking this case further and wrote in part, “This common sense law makes certain that the books kids have access to in school classrooms and libraries are age-appropriate. I’m going to keep on fighting to uphold our law that protects schoolchildren and parental rights.”
SF 496 also prohibits the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in K-6 curriculum. Iowa Safe Schools has filed a lawsuit against that part of the law. Locher is expected to also rule on that case.

Maggie Nurrenbern, right, listens as Clay County Presiding Commissioner Jerry Nolte speaks Monday in favor of her bill authorizing a Clay County sports and convention center authority. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)Two identical bills to give state backing for a new sports and convention center in Clay County are not an attempt to poach the Kansas City Chiefs or Royals from Jackson County, legislators were told Monday during a Senate committee hearing.
Instead, the bill sponsors said, the intent is to provide another location for new facilities for one or both of the teams in order to ensure they stay in Missouri .
“This has never been about pitting Jackson against Clay County,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from the Clay County portion of Kansas City. “This is making sure that the teams have all the options on the table to find a spot that will work well for them.”
Nurrenbern, who represents about two-thirds of Clay County, was joined by state Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall whose district has the remainder of Clay County.
As he ran for the Senate last year, Gregory said, he was asked repeatedly what could be done to keep the teams in Missouri. 
“If they go to another state, we’re looking at easily another 50, 60, 70 years, before we’ve got a shot to get them back,” he said.
With only seven weeks to go in the session, Gregory said after the hearing that he and Nurrenbern will be looking for a bill that can be amended to carry the legislation.
The bills would authorize a new Clay County Sports Complex Authority, modeled on the Jackson County organization that owns the Truman Sports Complex in eastern Kansas City where the Chiefs play home games in Arrowhead Stadium and the Royals play next door in Kauffman Stadium. The stadiums were built in the 1960s and leases for both teams run through the end of the 2030 season.
The bill would authorize a state payment of up to $3 million annually to support the authority if it leases its facility to a team in the NFL, NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball. The payment would only be made if lawmakers approve it in annual appropriation bills and only in an amount equal to the support from local governments.
The likelihood one or both teams will move is high after Kansas lawmakers last year passed several incentives intended to lure them across the state line.
The Royals first announced an intention to leave Kauffman Stadium in November 2022. The move would allow the Chiefs to remain in Arrowhead, demolish Kauffman and build a covered entertainment center.
In the spring of 2023, Clay County leaders announced interest in building a stadium in North Kansas City that could become the Royals new home.
Campaign committee controlled by KC mayor requested poll he denied involvement in

Soon after Clay County entered the conversation, a poll was leaked to the media widely seen as an effort to discredit the offer. It showed 70% of Clay County voters opposed a new sales tax to fund a stadium in North Kansas City. 
No one took responsibility for the poll at the time. It wasn’t until more than a year later that documents provided to The Independent revealed it was a political action committee formed to support Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas that paid for the Clay County polling.
The effort to relocate the Royals to a new downtown stadium stalled when voters last year rejected a proposal to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead Stadium.
Clay County is angling for both the Royals’ new home and for a new Chiefs training facility.
Clay County officials testifying Monday said their top priority is to find a solution to team facility needs that keeps both teams in Missouri.
“We have worked with local businesses, and we have worked with the local municipalities to make sure that we are all speaking with one voice, and it would be our pleasure to be able to add our voice to that of the state of Missouri,” Clay County Presiding Commissioner Jerry Nolte said.
But if the teams stay put at the Truman Sports Complex, move downtown or cross the state line, having the authority structure will help Clay County compete for other business, Clay County Associate Commissioner Scott Wagner said.
“This tool,” Wagner said, “can be helpful to us in the future for other sorts of teams, other sorts of opportunities that could potentially come to Clay County.”

A bill banning transgender girls from playing school sports in girls’ athletics competition is set up for final passage ahead of Friday’s final legislative deadline after a successful House vote Monday.
With two days to go in the 2025 legislative session, Senate Bill 1 is back in the Senate’s hands and could come to a final vote Wednesday or Friday.
If it passes and receives Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature, it will require all schools from elementary through college to designate teams as male, female and co-ed based on sex at birth and ban those assigned male at birth from playing on female teams. It also restricts access to facilities like restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping quarters during athletic events.
  Rep. Karen Lupton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“This legislation does not target individuals, it targets inequities,” said Homer Republican Rep. Chris Erwin, who chairs the House Education Committee. “It safeguards the decades of progress made in women’s athletics by reaffirming the state’s interest in promoting equal opportunity and preventing unfair advantages.”
“This bill speaks to the heart of athletic integrity,” he added. “It is about ensuring that every child, regardless of gender, has a chance to compete safely and fairly.”
Three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill: Augusta Rep. Lynn Heffner, Macon Rep. Tangie Herring and Valdosta Rep. Dexter Sharper. Another 13 Democrats did not vote on the bill.
Chamblee Democratic Rep. Karen Lupton characterized the bill as hateful and useless.

The NCAA and Georgia High School Association already ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ teams.
“If this is a shield for girls in sports, you’d think that there’d be lots of coaches, lots of schools that run sports programs, lots of athletes coming up, storming the castle, and saying, ‘oh my gosh, we need this now,’” Lupton said. “Instead, the people who spoke to the bill were athletes who are currently competing with and against transgender athletes. We had clergy speak against SB1. We had parents of transgender children speak against SB1. Not a single coach. Not a single athletic organization.”
Lilburn Democratic Rep. Jasmine Clark said the bill will harm transgender people and could sweep up transgender and cisgender women and girls into invasive gender checks.
Clark gave examples of people who have been adversely affected by anti-trans laws in other states, including cisgender women who were followed into the ladies’ room by male police and a transgender male wrestler who won a women’s championship after not being allowed to compete against boys.
“We have created a bill that is a license to harass, a license to bully, a license to harm, and these actual athletes do not want this,” she said.” They did not ask for this. And I think that that is a problem.”

The panel also sent five other bills to the Senate floor dealing with topics ranging from national guard scholarships to attendance policies. The anti-bullying legislation was the only bill that did not receive unanimous support during the meeting.
House File 865 would redefine “harassment” and “bullying” as “repeated and targeted” actions. The bill removes from current law a list of 17 traits or characteristics of a targeted student that would fall under bullying, including gender identity, sexuality, race, political belief and familial status.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said schools have used the current list of possible traits and characteristics to say their hands are tied when instances of bullying have not fallen under what is in Iowa code, leading to confusion and unequal treatment of students.
“These changes to the law ensure that all students are protected no matter what their particular traits or characteristics are,” Salmon said. “This removes any confusion schools may have about what constitutes bullying, and simplifies and clarifies the issue.”
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, voiced two concerns over the legislation, the first with changing the definitions of bullying and harassment.
“That’s a problem for me, because we should have a zero tolerance policy on bullying of any kind in our schools,” Trone Garriott said. “That’s the concern I hear from parents, is that schools are not taking bullying seriously and they’re not reporting it.”
Trone Garriott also took issue with removing the list of characteristics for schools to look toward for reporting bullying. She said the list is broad and not limiting for schools, and being able to identify specifically what the bullying is about is helpful for school response and for research into larger trends.
While Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, agreed with Trone Garriott’s point about specified characteristics being a good resource for schools, he said defining bullying as being targeted and repeated would be helpful in allowing school staff to take the direction of their interventions with students that makes the most sense for the situation.
The bill passed with a vote of 11-5.
This was the committee’s first meeting since the week of the first “funnel” deadline in the Iowa Legislature on March 7, with the second funnel only days away. Most policy bills have to receive approval from one chamber and a committee in the opposite chamber to remain eligible for debate after this week. Budget and tax bills are exempt from the funnel and bills that do not make the deadline could be revived as amendments to other bills.
More education action
Most of the bills passed out of the committee Monday saw no dissent from members.
Bills passed unanimously without discussion included House File 117, which would establish a new scholarship program for National Guard members earning certification rather than a degree and House File 392, allowing public and nonpublic schools grades K-12 to apply for a year-round academic calendar.
Zimmer expressed his support for House File 393, also passed unanimously, which would change how performance grades for attendance centers are calculated by no longer counting instances where a student has dropped out then came back to school more than once.
Trone Garriott also raised concerns about House File 870, but voted for it alongside the rest of the members. She said she worried the legislation, which would change Iowa’s compulsory attendance law to include exemptions for students attending religious instruction, is duplicative as there are already religious exemptions for teaching in Iowa code.
Several bills deferred
Sen. Lynn Evans, chair of the education committee, said three bills were deferred and would likely be brought up again at the committee’s Thursday meeting.
Senate File 269, passed out of subcommittee just hours before, would bar state universities from requiring diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory content in academic courses. House File 703 would change information provided to students by state loan programs and financial aid advisors and House File 189 would set requirements for public school districts with nonpublic school students wishing to participate in extracurricular athletics.

(Courtesy of Dakota Scout)A South Dakota lawsuit against the NCAA will stay in state court rather than move to federal court, a judge has decided.
The NCAA is the governing body for the highest level of collegiate athletics. State Attorney General Marty Jackley and the South Dakota Board of Regents sued the NCAA last year, alleging that a proposed $2.8 billion settlement meant to compensate college athletes would disproportionately burden smaller colleges, including schools like South Dakota State University and the University of South Dakota.
The NCAA filed a motion to move the case into federal court, saying the settlement’s provisions and implications stretch across state lines.
U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier signed an order Friday denying the NCAA’s request to move the lawsuit out of state court. Jackley praised the decision in a Monday news release.
Dates for further state court proceedings in Brookings County have not been scheduled.
The proposed $2.8 billion nationwide settlement for college athletes that motivated the lawsuit is an outgrowth of a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the NCAA’s previous practice of banning payments for student athletes violated antitrust laws. The settlement would require NCAA member schools to contribute to the settlement fund over the course of a decade.
Jackley said South Dakota wants a court order requiring an NCAA vote on how it intends to have schools pay for the settlement. That would allow South Dakota’s and other states’ universities to have a voice in the settlement that the NCAA has so far denied them, Jackley said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The U.S. Department of Education is putting Virginia schools on notice, warning they could lose federal funding and face further investigation if they fail to comply with parental rights laws.
On Friday, the department directed Virginia and other states to submit documentation proving compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), specifically regarding key “priority concerns” by April 30.
These concerns include parental rights to inspect and review education records, student safety, annual notification of rights, military recruiter access, and overall compliance. 
The directive follows reports that state educational agencies and school divisions are hiding critical information from parents, such as details about a child’s gender transition, or their mental and physical wellbeing.
The Virginia Department of Education did not respond to an inquiry for comment.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon directed the SPPO to investigate California and Maine for similar violations, accusing the states of enacting policies that prevent parents from accessing records related to their child’s gender transition.
The federal agency emphasized that laws like FERPA and PPRA override state policies.
“Parents are the most natural protectors of their children. Yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that imply students need protection from their parents,” McMahon said in a March 28 statement.
The department is accusing states and school districts of turning “the concept of privacy on its head” by prioritizing government officials’ concerns over those of parents and families. McMahon noted that moving forward, the correct application of FERPA will be to “empower all parents to protect their children from the radical ideologies that have taken over many schools.” 
In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has consistently made parental rights a cornerstone of his administration. Along with his Republican colleagues, Youngkin has leaned on a state law asserting that “a parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child.”
His administration has enacted several measures to reinforce these rights, including executive orders that require parents to be notified about drug overdoses and make mask-wearing optional. 
The governor also adopted legislation mandating that parents be informed about sexually explicit instructional materials in school libraries. Additionally, a proposal was put forward to require schools to notify parents if a student wishes to change their name, nickname or pronouns as listed in official records.
However, last week, Youngkin proposed an amendment to a bill backed by Democrats, which mandates school boards to send annual notifications to parents regarding the safe storage of prescription drugs and firearms. 
His amendment could derail the proposal, as it would require schools to notify at least one parent if a student seeks help from a social worker regarding their gender identity, and gain parental permission before any further action is taken.
The General Assembly is set to take up the amendment during Wednesday’s reconvened session.

“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to love a country that doesn’t really seem to want to love me back,” said Vanessa Sheridan, a transgender Air Force veteran, told attendees of the Minnesota Capitol rally. “The anti-trans forces in Washington are writing executive orders and laws that limit the civil rights of transgender American citizens. But do not be deceived. This is only a first step. Their ultimate goal is to eliminate us all together.”
Monday was the first national Transgender Day of Visibility in President Donald Trump’s second administration. Trump has signed numerous anti-trans executive orders, including restricting gender-affirming care for youth; directing the Department of Defense to create a new policy excluding transgender people from service; and another banning trans women and girls from participating in female sports.
Minnesota is an outlier among Midwestern states, with laws that protect people seeking or providing gender-affirming care.
Gov. Tim Walz, who signed trans-friendly bills in 2023, spoke at the rally, telling attendees that Minnesota will always be a welcoming place for transgender people. Walz said that Republicans are putting trans people’s lives at risk for political gain.
“They’ve chosen to demonize a marginalized community for their own selfish reasons,” Walz said. “Now is the time to stand up. We don’t need to recalibrate to think we can win elections by throwing some group of people under the damn bus. This battle has gone on for a long time, and it will continue to go on.”
Since the 2024 election, Democrats nationally have been grappling with how to handle transgender policies. Some Democrats have grown weary and wary of defending positions like allowing trans girls to play school sports, when a majority of Americans side with Republicans on the issue.
Kat Rohn, executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy organization OutFront Minnesota, said it’s important to celebrate wins for trans people whenever they come, like when House Democrats recently voted down a House Republican bill banning trans girls from participating in female sports in Minnesota.
“These are important wins and ones we should rightly celebrate, even in a moment that feels hard, and they didn’t just materialize out of nowhere,” Rohn said. “They were the product of our state’s long history of LGBTQ organizing, the product of trans voices and trans leaders at the heart of conversations around our communities, lives and needs. They were the product of a state that fundamentally believes we all belong.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2181-1024x528.jpg,,,2025-03-31 18:06:02.220908

At the very least, he’s added a new wrinkle to an emerging confrontation between Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Speaker Daniel Perez that could complicate negotiations over a state budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

In a letter to members of the Senate, Ben Albritton acknowledged DeSantis’s call to eliminate property taxes next year and, prior to that, to provide an average $1,000 rebate to the 5.1 million homesteaded properties across Florida this year as well as Perez’s call to permanently roll back the state’s sales tax.
Perez’s proposal would reduce the state’s coffers by about $5 billion annually and DeSantis’s proposal by at least that amount.
“These are both significant ideas, worthy of our thought and consideration,” Albritton wrote. “However, at this point, I believe it is prudent that a final tax cut package of this size be predominantly nonrecurring, while permanent tax cuts are explored during the interim.”
Nonrecurring means one-time tax cuts that would have to be renewed if the Legislature wants to do that next year. The Legislature routinely passes large tax packages but most of the reductions aren’t permanent. For instance, lawmakers passed a $1.14 billion tax plan last year but just $110 million represented continuing spending.
Albritton advised senators to keep an open mind but added:
“Cutting taxes now does little good if they have to be raised two years from now to address budget shortfalls. No one wants a repeat of the Great Recession, and we’ve done our best to avoid that by [reining] in spending, paying down debt, and setting aside significant reserves,” Albritton wrote. 
“There are cumulative impacts to every tax cut. We need to do our due diligence and understand those impacts, combined with the projected budget shortfalls already on the horizon. 
“Florida is not Washington, D.C., California, or New York. We take great pride in our balanced budget, low taxes, and responsible fiscal planning that have made our state the envy of the nation.”
DeSantis that very morning reiterated his call for property tax cuts, which would require ratification by the voters through a state constitutional amendment, possibly on the 2026 general election ballot. If the Legislature doesn’t say yes to that this year, or to a sales tax cut from 6% to 5.25%, as Perez proposes, it would have time to act during next year’s legislative session.
Regressive
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has judged Florida’s sale tax the most regressive in the country, meaning that it falls most heavily on those who can least afford it, in terms of its bite into household income. On the other hand, collections benefit from spending by tourists and winter residents.
DeSantis, for his part, argues property taxes mean “ponying up money to the government just for the courtesy of using your own property.”
Albritton observed that the Legislature is near the half-way point of its 2025 session.
“At the end of the day, I’m not comfortable passing a budget that is balanced for this year, but likely creates major shortfalls down the road,” he wrote. 
“Cutting waste and inefficiency plays an important role in responsible spending; however, there is a cost associated with maintaining our transportation, clean water, and health care infrastructure, ensuring universal school choice for every family, hurricane response and recovery, and of course public safety. We owe it to taxpayers to get this right.”
The tax rift is likely to make it more difficult for the Legislature to complete the one thing it is required to do every annual session: Pass a state budget.
The House and Senate released early iterations of proposed spending plans for state fiscal year 2025-2026 that would spend $112.95 billion and $117.36 billion, respectively.
That means there’s a $4.4 billion difference between the proposals that must be negotiated and settled before the chambers can begin fine tuning how to spend the money.
The spending difference climbs to $4.6 billion if the $200 million appropriation in the Rural Renaissance initiative championed by Albritton is taken into consideration.
Both proposed budgets are less than the existing spending of $118.6 billion.

“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are stiffing our farmers and processors — taking away resources these folks were guaranteed, threatening small businesses’ ability to stay open and people’s livelihoods,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), one of 17 cosponsors.
In addition to 15 Democrats, two independent senators who caucus with them, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, signed on to the bill.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has stopped reimbursing farmers and farm organizations for money they’ve spent, despite contracts they have already signed with the agency. The contracts call for farmers to be reimbursed for expenses they incur under the contracts.
Honor Farmer Contracts Act, introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), would require USDA “to release illegally withheld funding for all contracts and agreements previously entered into by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” Baldwin’s office said in a statement announcing the legislation.
Under President Donald Trump, “USDA has refused to make reimbursement payments to fulfill signed contracts, without any indication of when or whether farmers will be paid the money they paid out and are owed,” Baldwin’s office said.
Farmers and organizations serving them contract with the USDA for various programs to connect with local markets and improve their productivity. The department then pays farmers back for the expenses they incur under those contracts. The department’s failure to pay strains finances both for the individual farmers and for the organizations that work with them under the programs, Baldwin’s office said.
The legislation would require USDA to unfreeze all signed agreements and make all past due payments as quickly as possible. It would also bar the department from canceling agreements or contracts unless there has been a failure to comply with their terms and conditions.
The bill would prohibit the department from closing county offices, field offices or centers of the Farm Service Agency, the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Rural Development Service without notification at least 60 days in advance and justifying the closing to Congress.
On March 7, Baldwin said the USDA had resumed another previously stalled stream of funding, $6.5 million in grants for dairy businesses to diversify and market their products.
Baldwin has also demanded the Trump administration to reverse its cancellation in March of a program connecting farmers to local food banks.

Democrat-drafted proposals in the two chambers are demonstrably different in how much is spent on special education, what grant programs are cut and when state funds are distributed to school districts.
And it’s unclear what Democrats will do if new taxes they are counting on for billions of dollars for education are not approved.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal noted this week that the share of the operating budget going to public schools would be about the same in the Senate plan, while in the House proposal it would continue to shrink. 
“We’re trying to figure out how much of each budget relies on the revenue,” he added.
The current budget, which runs through June 30, spends roughly $31.2 billion of the general fund — the cache of state tax dollars used to fund day-to-day operations — on public schools. That works out to roughly 43%, down from the high-water mark of over 50% in 2019.
The Senate is proposing a two-year $78.5 billion budget, of which $34.3 billion of the general fund – 43.7% – would go to public schools. The House drew up a $77.8 billion plan, of which $33.2 billion, or 43%, is penciled in for education.
The Senate approved its operating budget on Saturday with only Democratic support.  The House is expected to vote on its package Monday. Once passed, authors will begin negotiating to reconcile differences as they work to get a deal ahead of April 27, the last scheduled day of the session.
Tackling the cost drivers
In dollars and cents, the single largest difference between the two budgets is funding of special education in the state’s 295 public school districts.
The Senate plan contains a $1 billion increase in the next biennium compared to $188.9 million in the House. 
The state distributes an amount of money for each student enrolled in a school, plus additional dollars for each special education student under a formula known as the multiplier.
What is in the Senate budget intends to cover the cost of lifting a cap on state funding for special education programs, covering these services for those up to age 22, and increasing the multiplier to drive more dollars to districts. Most of the House dollars cover expenses from a higher multiplier.
Another financial challenge for school districts is the surge in prices for materials, supplies and general operating costs, including insurance premiums, natural gas rates and utility charges. Reykdal had pushed for $350 million more in the next budget. 
The Senate wrote in an additional $175 million for the coming two years; the House has no increased funding.
But the House wants to increase Local Effort Assistance funding by $200 a student in 2026 and $300 a student in 2027. That adds up to an added $217 million for property-poor districts,  funding they can use for programs and activities not funded by the state.
There is a catch. Those additional dollars are tied to a proposed House bill to raise the cap on annual property tax collections. The legislation has yet to be voted on.
The Senate made no changes in the Local Effort Assistance funding formula.

Big cuts 
One of the single largest reductions in each budget concerns nearly three-dozen academic enrichment and technical education programs paid for with grants.
The House logs $138 million in savings by eliminating funding for all but one dealing with financial education. In the Senate proposal, $48.9 million is trimmed, ensuring partial or full funding of many of the undertakings.
Affected programs range from instruction in aerospace and advanced manufacturing to civics education and science and technology fields, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Both budgets count on saving roughly $75 million by funding enrollment in the Transition to Kindergarten program at its current level and not paying for expanded enrollment as planned. The program, created two years ago, provides children under 5 years old with additional help in preparing for kindergarten. It’s been popular and enrollment has been projected to grow.
And each budget is targeting the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for cuts.
The Senate wants Reykdal to shave $4.3 million in administrative costs, plus another $3 million collectively from an array of statewide programs. These include preventing youth suicide and bullying and improving students’ math skills and reading literacy. The agency needs to cut $1.8 million in administrative expenses in the House budget, but the statewide programs are unscathed.
Making the numbers work
State funds are paid out monthly to school districts through what’s known as apportionment. Both chambers employ a similar gimmick with this process to reduce spending in the next budget and balance out their ledgers.
The House adjusts the percentage of monthly payouts to be lower in the months before July, when new fiscal years begin, and higher in August. By doing so, Democrats shift $396.7 million of spending out of the 2025-27 budget cycle and into the next one. The Senate moves $386.2 million of apportionment spending into the next budget.
“It’s a math game,” Reykdal said, adding there would likely be a reserve established in case a district ran into an urgent cash flow problem. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
No debate here
There’s money in both budgets to bump up what the state provides districts for teachers, administrators and staff.
For a certificated instructor, the minimum allocation statewide will rise from $78,209 to $80,164 in the next fiscal year and $82,248 in the second year of the biennium. It will be $59,000 for staff and $122,000 for administrators in the biennium. Most districts use locally generated tax dollars to pay teachers, office workers, principals and superintendents above those levels.
And both budgets fully fund bonuses for teachers who earn certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Former Gov. Jay Inslee proposed pausing the bonuses entirely to save $151 million in the next budget and Gov. Bob Ferguson has endorsed the idea, too.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/classroom-students-raising-hands.jpg,,,2025-03-31 18:06:02.220908

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would regulate foreign-influenced political activity on behalf of certain countries received its first committee hearing of the legislative session on Monday.
The measure by Tampa Bay Area-Republican Danny Burgess (SB 766) would require an individual registered to work an an agent of a ‘foreign country of concern’ to register with the Division of Elections within 10 days and disclose identity, affiliations, foreign transactions, and political activities and expenditures from the past year.
Florida law defines a foreign country of concern as the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Cuba, the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro, and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Florida law already bans foreign nationals from directly or indirectly making campaign contributions. Burgess said his legislation mirrors part of the Federal Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law that requires certain agents of foreign principals who are engaged in political activities to make periodic public disclosure of those relationships, as well as activities, receipts, and disbursements in support of those activities.
There has been a recent surge in cases being prosecuted in the past few years, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Several states, including California, New York, Illinois, and Georgia have introduced FARA-like legislation over the past year, but none has yet made it into law.
Those found in violation of the proposed law would face an initial fine of $500. Any repeated violation would be subject to a $2,000 fine. Any repeated violation would subject the individual to a fine up to $10,000 and either temporary or permanent ban from future registration.
Burgess’ original bill was much broader, requiring any and all agents of a foreign principal and foreign-supported political organization to register with the Division of Elections.
But he said that after “significant feedback from the stakeholders and trying to balance the actual ability to implement this legislation, we wanted to take that significant step to accomplish a notable goal and a meritorious part of what this legislation was trying to get at.”
A companion measure sponsored by Hillsborough Republican Michael Owen (HB 583) has already passed through its first committee.
Burgess’ proposal was unanimously approved by the Senate Ethics & Elections Committee, with no debate taking place.

Greg Gianforte espouses his income tax cut plan on the steps of the Montana Capitol on March 28, 2025. Courtesy photo. Gov. Greg Gianforte made another public pronouncement last week that his administration would deliver the largest tax cut in Montana history — to the tune of $850 million, according to his office. 
But opponents to plans to cut income taxes say the governor’s approach would disproportionately benefit the state’s wealthiest earners, while low- and middle-income Montanans would see just double-digit cuts. 
“We’re here today because we believe in a simple truth– you know how to spend your money better than the government does,” Gianforte said during a rally on the steps of the Montana Capitol on March 28. “Every day you wake up, you go to work. You provide for yourself and for your family. You budget carefully and you save where you can. But too often, when you get a paycheck, you look at it and you wonder, ‘Where did it go?’ We know the answer — taxes.”
Earlier that day, the governor’s preferred plan to cut taxes received its first hearing before the Legislature. 
Carried by Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, Senate Bill 323 would lower the top income tax rate — paid by Montanans earning more than $21,000 as single filers — from 5.9% to 5.4% in 2026 and down to 4.9% in 2027. The bill also cuts the long-term capital gains tax from 4.1% to 3.9% and expands the Earned Income Tax Credit from 10% to 15%. 
Montana currently has two income tax brackets — one at 4.7% and one at 5.9% — which split at roughly $21,000 for an individual filer or $41,000 for married filers. The state used to have a six-bracket marginal tax system until 2021.
Calling it the “third installment” of the governor’s long-term plan to get to a single, flat tax rate for the state, Mark Blasdel, director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and former Senate President, pointed out Montana has the highest tax rate of mountain region states. However, many of the states surrounding Montana also have a statewide sales tax. 
“Montana is also currently the 17th highest tax rate in the nation. So we believe this is an incredible opportunity to bring this down another 1%,” Blasdel told the Senate Taxation Committee. “We think this is a great way to continue that downward trend of the collection of taxes. It makes it so that we continue to be able to put pressure so that the budget does not continue to grow at a higher grade than inflation, and it continues to keep more money in the pockets of hard working Montanans.”
But opponents decried the across-the-board cutting of the top tax bracket, saying it doesn’t offer meaningful relief to middle-income earners. 
An analysis by the Montana Budget and Policy Center indicates that the wealthiest 1% of Montanans would see roughly $10,000 in tax breaks under the policy, while individuals making $50,000 or less would receive less than $100.  
“The problem with structuring an income tax reform in this way … is that for every dollar you have, you get that cut. So if you have a lot of dollars, a huge bucket of dollars, you get that cut on every single dollar in that bucket,” Rose Bender, Director of Research for the Budget and Policy Center, told the committee. “And if you just have a couple dollars you get that cut on just those couple dollars. So it’s really impossible to reform income tax in this way while not disproportionately benefiting the wealthy.”
But Kassmier pushed back and said that giving Montanans their money back, no matter how much, was a goal that everyone should want to get behind. 
“These income tax dollars are the people’s dollars. We have an opportunity here in the session to give our the people’s money back, and if it’s only going to give somebody $50 back or $100 back, I’m telling you that that means a lot to the people that are out there working,” Kassmier said. 
At previous press conferences, Gianforte has said his plan is the only comprehensive plan that addresses all income levels, with the expansion of the earned income tax credit helping out the lowest earners. 
In addition, the reduction in capital gains tax rate was lauded by supporters of the bill as helping farmers and ranchers. 
“A lot of people think of (capital gains) as just stocks and bonds and those types of things that would come into play here, but for farmers and ranchers, capital gains comes into play on sale of property and also on certain livestock and equipment sales,” said Nicole Rolf, with the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. 
SB 323 was also supported by Montana Taxpayers Association, the Montana Stockgrowers Association, and the Montana Chamber of Commerce. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, Montana Nonprofit Association and a former Democratic legislator, Margie McDonald, spoke against the bill. 
The governor on Friday said that while there are several proposals aimed at reforming incomes taxes, his plan is the “only fool-proof conservative plan.”
“Cut. The. Rate,” Gianforte said.

[subhead]Majority support for middle class cuts [/subhead]
A competing proposal, sold as a “middle-class millenium” bill, passed the Senate with support from all but three Senators on Monday. 
Sen. Mike Yakawich, R-Billings, carried Senate Bill 203 with support from both majority and minority leadership as cosponsors.
Rather than cut the top tax bracket rate, SB 203 would expand the lower bracket to comprise individuals making up to $100,000 — covering up to the 90th percentile of earners, according to Yakawich. For married couples filing jointly the bracket delineation would be at $200,000.
The bill “provides income tax relief for thousands of middle-class Montanans by expanding the number of people eligible for the state’s lower (4.7%) tax rate,” Yakawich said. “This bill is tailored to the middle-class Montana taxpayers.”
Yakawich used his five millennial-aged children as examples — they have good jobs and families, but still struggle to make ends meet with rising costs of living in Montana. 
“It’s that middle 60 to 90 percentile. We really want to love them up. We want to thank them,” he said. “That money that they save … might help them come back into the community, come back into our state.”
SB 203 also changes the long-term capital gains tax, against expanding the eligibility for the lowest tax rate to an individual’s first $100,000, from the current $20,500. 
The measure passed the Senate 47-3 and will next be heard by the Senate Finance and Claims Committee.
“Residents across the state repeatedly told us that tax relief is a top priority for them,” Senate President Matt Regier said in a statement following the vote. “SB 203 is a historic step to limit government and help all Montana income tax payers prosper.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apf-rally.png,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

A group of professors at the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Florida International University are seeking a preliminary injunction against SB 266, a 2023 law that slashed the number of general education courses offered at Florida institutions and prohibits spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a move academics argue harms their academic ambitions. 
Attorneys representing the state defended against the preliminary injunction in front of U.S. District Chief Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee. 
The plaintiffs allege viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, that the law is over-broad, and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
SB 266 prohibits general education courses that “distort significant historical events or include curriculum that teaches identity politics,” and some professors have argued the law is not clear enough. 
Although omission from the general education course list may not violate the Constitution, the professors argue, they are being injured by chilling their speech and fear repercussions in post-tenure review. 
No more ‘indoctrinating concepts’ in Florida’s general education courses, chancellor says

The professors argue the law undermines the exchange of ideas by restricting or eliminating courses, cutting funding for DEI initiatives, impeding academic research, and stifling student voices. 
“We’re just free to starve out any viewpoint we don’t like, I get it,” Walker told attorneys for the state, pointing out that his ruling would be on constitutionality, not whether the law is appropriate. 
Funding denial
The suit was filed in part by UF political science professor Sharon Austin, who complains she was denied funding to present at a 2024 conference hosted by Diversity Abroad, which the school had paid for her to present at in 2023. The school specifically cited SB 266 in refusing to pay for her to appear subsequently, the suit alleges.
Hala Sandridge, an attorney for the state, argued that the UF denial of funding for Austin did not prohibit her attendance, and if a lack of funding inhibited the ability to travel, she could have presented virtually. Sandridge argued Austin’s denial of funding is “not a wholesale denial” for all DEI-related conferences. 
The lawsuit argues that the state funds the Hamilton Center, a UF academic center “devoted to research and teaching on Western civilization.” Plaintiffs argue that the topics at the Hamilton Center “fall within the State’s preferred view of the Western Canon and related speech … although they also arguably fall within ‘political or social activism’ but have not been targeted.”
‘Vague and overbroad’
As part of regulations created by the Florida Board of Governors, courses like “Principles of Sociology” and “Politics of Race” no longer satisfy the general education requirement. The plaintiffs complains that reduces enrollment in the courses, causing departments to lose enrollment-based funding. 
“Given the vague and overbroad prohibitions in S.B. 266, professors at Florida’s colleges and universities fear how their ordinary conduct, potentially violative of S.B. 266, may impact their ability to retain their jobs at all,” the lawsuit asserts. They added that professors now may lose tenure during a new system of post-tenure review, another action taken by the Board of Governors.
Plaintiff attorneys said they were not aware of any professor who had been dismissed because of SB 266.

The Michigan Family Protection Act will go into effect April 1, officially repealing a ban that made Michigan the only state in the nation to criminalize surrogacy contracts, with supporters of the legislation saying it also provides long overdue legal safeguards for families formed through assisted reproduction.
Among them is Ginanne Brownell, the communications and research director for the Michigan Fertility Alliance, which advocated for the nine-bill package that also strengthens the rights of children born through surrogacy in arenas such as inheritance and access to their own birth certificates.
“I think it’s really important that we change the narrative around surrogacy,” Brownell told the Michigan Advance. “I think the problem is that for such a long time we’ve talked about these misconceptions of who surrogates are in the U.S.”
Brownell, who has unexplained infertility, said when she decided to utilize surrogacy, she was surprised to find that there were no agencies willing to work with her in Michigan because of the 1988 Surrogate Parenting Act, which prohibited compensated surrogate parentage contracts. 
After finding a surrogate in Illinois who delivered her twins in 2018, Brownell started researching the history Michigan has played in surrogacy. 

“Michigan was pivotal to surrogacy across the globe for many, many reasons. The first compensated surrogacy contract in the world was signed in Dearborn in 1976. Noel Keane was the lawyer in that,” Brownell said.
In 1986, she said Keane helped arrange a contract for a New Jersey couple whose embryos were implanted in a surrogate, resulting in the world’s first child born through a gestational surrogate in Ypsilanti.
However, that same year a child born through a surrogacy contract arranged by Keane made international headlines when the surrogate mother refused to honor the contract and fled to Florida with the child, sparking a legal battle that spotlighted the ethical implications of surrogacy. The so-called Baby M case resulted in the 1988 ban on compensated surrogacy in Michigan.
“And that’s where the law stayed for almost 40 years,” Brownell said, adding that she was introduced to Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Michigan Fertility Alliance while she was working on her book, “Elusive Mommyhood: An Investigative Reporter’s Personal Journey into IVF and Surrogacy”.
“She had her daughter born through surrogacy as well. We both realized we were really passionate about this, and so we both kind of decided, ‘Hey, let’s try and change the law’, Brownell said.
After her twins were born in 2018, Brownell, who works in London while maintaining her residency in Michigan, told the Advance she had an opportunity to interview Gretchen Whitmer as she campaigned for governor.
“Because my kids had just been born, I was back in Michigan for several months waiting for their passports to be issued,” Brownell said. “And so I was explaining this to her and she said, ‘Why is that? That’s so weird,’and so we both spoke about it briefly and she said, ‘Well, that’s something that should be changed’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, it should be.’”
Brownell said she reflected on that conversation when Whitmer signed the legislation into law, which she was present for.
“It felt like it came full circle that we’d had this conversation about changing the law and here we were in the same room where she signed it into law and I had been a part of that,” Brownell said.
The process to get the law changed included testimony from parents across Michigan who related their stories of infertility and frustration at the barriers Michigan had enacted to starting their families.
Among those testifying was state Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills), sponsor of the main bill in the package, who said that as a breast cancer survivor, she was unable to conceive naturally due to the chemotherapy treatments she underwent.
“But I was lucky I was able to put off chemo by one month in order to go through IVF [in vitro fertilization] and egg harvesting so that one day I might be able to have a family of my own,” Steckloff said during testimony last year.
Steckloff’s bill, HB 5207, established the Assisted Reproduction and Surrogacy Parentage Act, which sets standards for creating a surrogacy contract including that a surrogate be 21 or older, have previously given birth to a child, completed a medical and mental health consultation and have independent legal representation of their choice, all paid for by the intended parents.
Although Whitmer signed the Michigan Family Protection Act into law in April 2024, Republicans in the Legislature actively opposed the measure and refused to give it immediate effect, making it unable to officially begin until 90 days after December 31, when the 102nd Legislature adjourned its session, which will be April 1.

That opposition, supported by the Michigan Catholic Conference and Right to Life of Michigan, was based on concerns that legalized surrogacy contracts can exploit vulnerable women. Among them was state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), who urged his colleagues to vote no on the legislation that he contended puts “vulnerable women at risk of exploitation” and “fundamentally redefines family.”
Meanwhile, Brownell says the Michigan Fertility Alliance is now launching a new grassroots coalition called State Strong, which will be advocating for surrogacy and fertility access nationwide.
“In a lot of these states they might just have one or two advocates that, for example, they’re seeing that there’s like really bad IVF legislation in say Nebraska. So they would kind of reach out to us and say, what should we do with the messaging on this? Do you have any legislation that’s happened that you can share with us? Because a lot of these people are just kind of like us, volunteers, people who have never really worked on legislation advocacy before. And so State Strong is continuing that fight on a national level now as well,” Brownell said.
While those issues will also get more attention later this month during National Infertility Awareness Week from April 20-26, Brownell says when it comes to the children who are created through surrogacy, the details of how they came to be are not nearly as important as their very existence.
“We need to start asking them how they feel about it. And I think that you have hundreds of thousands of children who are born through surrogacy, the majority of whom are still under the age of 18, but as they start coming of age, they can tell their stories,” Brownell said, pointing to a University of Cambridge 20-year longitudinal study of third-party assisted reproduction which found positive family relationships and child adjustment from childhood to adult life. 
“It found that children born through surrogacy, how did they feel about it? They didn’t care. It was just like ‘Whatever. Why do I care how I was born?’”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Journalists at Wisconsin Watch — a nonprofit news organization that includes the Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service — have ratified their first union contract.
The agreement, signed on Friday, March 28, includes minimum salary guarantees and annual cost-of-living increases along with layoff restrictions, severance pay and benefits as well as “just cause” protections against arbitrary terminations, according to the Wisconsin Watch Union. The contract also includes provisions for medical, parental, caregiver and bereavement leave.
The union is a subunit of Milwaukee NewsGuild Local 34051, which also represents newsroom employees at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
“I’m really proud of the outcome,” said Jack Kelly, a Wisconsin Watch reporter and union bargaining team member. Staffers represented by the union were active in advocating for their priorities during contract negotiations, giving personal testimony about issues important to them, he said.
“They put some faces and names to the numbers we were asking for,” Kelly said in an interview Monday.  “I think the contract is going to make Wisconsin Watch and Neighborhood News Service better places to work.”
Kelly also commended Wisconsin Watch management’s handling of the bargaining process.
“We certainly had meetings that were long and stressful, but I think in general we were able to engage a collegial approach to bargaining,” Kelly said.
“We’ll continue to do great journalism knowing our workplace is more structured, secure and protected,” said Phoebe Petrovic, a Wisconsin Watch investigative reporter who was among those who initiated the union organizing effort, in a statement released by the union.
Wisconsin Watch journalists announced their union organizing campaign in October 2023, and the organization’s board subsequently agreed to voluntarily recognize the union. Protection against arbitrary firings was among the goals employees cited.
Wisconsin Watch was founded in 2009 as the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, still its legal name. The Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service became part of Wisconsin Watch in July 2024 and its employees became part of the bargaining unit.
Devin Blake, a Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service reporter who joined the bargaining team, said that in addition to tangible gains the union brought him closer to coworkers. “I have such a clearer sense of what matters to their lives and work,” Blake said in the union’s statement.
Digital news outlets and nonprofit news organizations have seen growing union representation in the last several years, with outlets including ProPublica and The Marshall Project joining the ranks of unionized newsrooms.

Kelly announced she was vetoing two bills, including one that would have rolled the budget over if the Legislature failed to pass one. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday vetoed a bill that would roll over the previous year’s state budget if the Legislature failed to pass one, pointing out that every legislative body since the state’s founding had managed to pass a budget and she expects nothing less of today’s legislators.
Senate Bill 14 sets in place a continuous budget that would change only if amended, lapsed or eliminated by the Legislature. Kelly sharply rebuked the idea that such a bill is necessary.

“If this Legislature cannot do what every previous Legislature has been able to do since our founding — through periods of war, famine, pandemic, recession, the Dust Bowl, and even the Great Depression — then they will have to do it over my veto because I will not sanction it, nor will the people of Kansas,” Kelly said in a news release.

In a joint statement, Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said SB14 prevents government shutdowns at the state level by providing for continuing appropriations.
“Kansans are tired of watching the government shutdown drama at the federal level, where politicians use people’s livelihoods as leverage to get their way,” the two legislative leaders said. “Sadly, the governor decided that she prefers the ways of Washington over ensuring state government, including our schools, is always open and operating. We stand ready to override her veto when we return.”
The Legislature is scheduled to return April 10-11 to consider the governor’s vetoes and pass any last-minute legislation before adjourning for the year.

Along with SB 14, Kelly vetoed Senate Bill 5, which restricts the use of federal funds for elections and election-related activities without legislative approval.
Addressing concerns voiced by a few legislators about voter fraud and foreign interference, Kelly said election officials would be more capable of addressing such threats if they received Congressional funding.
“It doesn’t make sense to turn down these resources that make our local elections in Kansas safe, secure and accurate,” she said. “Given that the Legislature only convenes for three months each year, how can we expect them to approve funding when they are not available year-round? Instead of obstructing our electoral process, lawmakers should concentrate on the real issues impacting Kansans, rather than complicating the management of election funds.”
Masterson and Hawkins also promised an override on this veto. SB 5, they said, is about ensuring the integrity of elections.

“Federal taxpayer money flowing into our elections threatens the integrity and opens the door to nefarious actors who might want to tip the scale in favor of partisan politics,” their statement said. “SB5 simply ensures that election officials cannot accept outside funds unless it’s allowed by law. It’s disappointing the governor chose to side with those who want to undermine our elections or give the appearance of mischief. We side with common sense and election security, and that’s why we’re committed to overriding her veto.”


 Three bills pass scrutiny


Kelly allowed three bills to become law without her signature.
House Bill 2106 bans contributions from foreign nationals for the support or defeat of a proposed amendment to the Kansas constitution. Kelly said she supports stopping foreign influence on elections in Kansas, and said federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to federal, state or local elections.
She chose not to sign the bill because she believes it goes “too far.”
“I cannot sign a bill that takes away the ability of Kansans and Kansas businesses to support elections if they accept money from overseas for any purpose, not just those related to elections,” she said. “Forcing Kansans to choose between accepting financial support for any reason or surrendering their voice in the political process is wrong.”
Kelly said HB 2106 potentially opens the opportunity for litigation because of limitations on speech and association, as well as potential violations of First Amendment protections in the U.S. Constitution.


House Bill 2027, which reorganizes sections of the public assistance law, became law without Kelly’s signature because she refused to be associated with the HOPE Act, which passed in 2015 and restricted Kansans’ ability to access social service programs.
“The HOPE Act was wrong then, and it remains wrong now,” Kelly said. “Legislators are only trying to put lipstick on a pig, and I refuse to associate myself with the HOPE Act. Now, more than ever, the Legislature should look for ways to support working Kansas families rather than further shredding the safety net that gives Kansans a bridge back to self-sufficiency.”
Kelly called Senate Bill 105 a “partisan power grab by the Legislature.” This bill allows the Legislature to have a say in the appointment process for filling vacancies for U.S. senator, state treasurer, and insurance commissioner.


Kelly critiqued the process laid out in the bill as “overly bureaucratic.”


“Had the Legislature passed a simpler method for modifying the appointment process for these offices, I would’ve signed it into law,” she said. “However, given my concerns about the messy process this bill creates, the bill will become law without my signature.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kelly-SOS-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Four years ago, Bridgette Whiteman said she was dying on the floor of her parents’ basement, an alcoholic “drinking away.”
One in four people who are transgender suffer from alcohol use disorder, she said, and Whiteman kept quiet about her problem, but she’s sober now, besides the occasional celebratory drink.
Whiteman said two years ago, she was homeless in Missoula while finishing her degree, among 19 transgender, nonbinary and Two Spirit people who were reported as unhoused by the Missoula Organization of Realtors at the time — “I can think of at least one that they missed.”
And one year ago, Whiteman was crying and telling her boyfriend she had been raped, and she said two-in-five people who are trans, nonbinary and Two Spirit have experienced sexual violence.
Whiteman said when Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula, a transgender woman, won her first election, she told Zephyr she wanted to join her at the Capitol.

Monday, Whiteman made good on that promise as part of Transgender Day of Visibility at the Capitol, celebrated with colorful banners, chalk art and chants.
“Visibility matters,” said Whiteman, with TransVisible Montana. “Build support in your community.
“Support your neighbors. Uplift the marginalized in society. We all belong in Montana.”
At the microphone, Julia Maxon, with Catalyst Montana, said the national day commemorating people who are transgender was founded in 2009.
Unlike the day of remembrance in the fall that honors people who are lost to transphobia, Maxon said Trans Day of Visibility is meant to celebrate transgender people who are living.
To a crowd of a few dozen that rallied shortly after a light spring snow, they also said it’s important to acknowledge Indigenous people, whose land is occupied by settlers.
“We want to acknowledge the trans community has always been part of this land in the form of Two Spirit people since time immemorial,” Maxon said.

A banner draped across the steps of the Capitol read, “Trans people belong in Montana.” Other signs of support read, “Trans people cannot be erased,” and “Protect Trans Kids.”
The crowd booed House Bill 121 and House Bill 300, both signed last week by Gov. Greg Gianforte and among a multitude of bills that Maxon said would harm people who are transgender, nonbinary or intersex.
Participants cheered the ACLU of Montana for filing a lawsuit against HB 121, which took effect immediately. The national ACLU and Legal Voice also joined in the lawsuit.
HB 121 requires public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females based on “external genitalia present at birth.”
It applies to public schools, correctional centers, domestic violence shelters, and public buildings such as libraries.
HB 300 restricts the ability of transgender women from participating in female sports. Sponsor Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, earlier said it would protect the ability of women to receive scholarships, medals and leadership opportunities.
In a statement last week, Gianforte, a Republican, said the legislation was about safeguarding privacy for women and girls and ensuring separate facilities for them.
The bills passed on partisan lines.
  Morgan Syring, with Forward Montana, led the crowd at the Capitol in a chant and call back on Transgender Day of Visibility in 2025. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
“We think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison,” Gianforte said.
At the rally, Maxon described the bills as evidence of increasing fascism in the country, threatening people’s bodily autonomy and safety.
“Despite the ongoing state of oppression and violence we are experiencing, we will not be silenced,” Maxon said. “Like all Montanans, we deserve safety, dignity and respect.”
Morgan Syring, with Forward Montana, led the group in a chant and call back.
“What do we do when our bodily autonomy is under attack?” Syring said.
“Stand up. Fight back,” the crowd yelled.

Larry Keefe, who’s been on the job for a month, said he’s pitched the idea to the Trump administration. Other states could involve their emergency management agencies in immigration enforcement, too, if the federal government approves, Keefe said during the first meeting of the State Immigration Enforcement Council, composed of four sheriffs and four police chiefs.

“We have the world-class, absolute best in Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Division of Emergency Management, and he is really good about safely moving people and stuff around in high-stress, high-pressure emergency situations, including soft-sided facilities, hard-sided facilities — whatever the state of the art is and in the planet Earth on how to house people and move people and feed people, and treat people safely and well, he knows it,” Keefe said during the meeting at the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.
Keefe, who organized Gov. Ron DeSantis’ migrant flight from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in 2022, pressed for military judicial officials within the Florida National Guard to secure authorization to act as immigration judges under the U.S. Department of Justice. DeSantis and Keefe met with border czar Tom Homan on March 20, Keefe said.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani criticized the idea.
“FDEM should be focused on responding to hurricanes and natural disasters — not engaging in immigration enforcement,” Eskamani said. “I will also add that the main beneficiary of this concept will be the for-profit private prison industry, who will receive our tax dollars to hold individuals without due process.”
Council faces reality of logistics in deportations
Questions about where Florida will house immigrants rounded up by local and state law enforcement took center stage during the four-hour meeting.
Florida law enforcement entities are signing up officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization, which requires a 40-hour online training, as part of the federal 287(g) program. As of Monday, Florida agreements with ICE make up 45% of the existing 287(g) agreements in the country, according to ICE’s database.
  Bob Gualtieri via Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.
So far, only highway patrol troopers are completing the training, but Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said he doesn’t know how enforcement will work considering the inadequate number of beds in immigration detention centers.
“We absolutely have to give guidance to the cops on the street,” Gualtieri said. “We have to give them some framework within which to work. You can’t just give them these credentials and say, ‘Here, go do something.’ This is not gonna work.”
Gualtieri, Senate President Ben Albritton’s council pick, said ICE has rejected a proposal to have sheriffs transport immigrants to ICE offices after holding them for 48 hours in county jails.
“We were going to get them out of these county jails within that 48-hour period, coordinate with ICE, get them to an ICE sub-office,” the sheriff said. “ICE could then do the processing, and they could get them into the ICE system, but ICE wouldn’t approve the plan, so it’s dead. So, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Meanwhile, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, are pressuring cities to enter into agreements with ICE, threatening city councilmembers in Fort Myers with removal from office after they took a 3-3 vote blocking the agreement. The council reversed its decision days later.
The council also wants the federal government to lower its standards to allow use of state and county detention facilities, the council’s chair, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, said. He offered the suggestion after hundreds protested overcrowding and a lack of beds, food, and access to medicine at ICE’s Krome Detention Center in Miami, according to the Miami Herald.

After the governor vetoed a bill containing the requirement last week, the state Senate sustained the veto Monday at the Capitol in Pierre. The House voted earlier Monday to override the veto, but agreement from both chambers is required to overturn the governor’s action.
Michael Rohl, R-Aberdeen, was among the senators who opposed the bill and supported the veto. While the bill’s sponsors said it would force more inclusion of rural areas in the political process, Rohl said the bill could harm rural voters.
“It gives every district veto power,” Rohl said. “That means that we, as a small community, don’t have a voice unless we get Sioux Falls to agree.”
Governor vetoes effort to restrict constitutional amendment process with geographic rule

The legislation, House Bill 1169, would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 Senate districts spread across the state. Petitions would have needed a number of signatures from each district equal to 5% of the total votes cast for governor in that district during the last general election.
That would have been an addition to the existing requirement that petitions have a total number of signatures — from anywhere in the state — equal to at least 10% of the votes cast statewide for governor in the last general election.
House Bill 1169’s main sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Reimer, R-Chamberlain, said Monday she’s willing to work on the legislation’s language and bring it back next year.
Reimer and other lawmakers who wanted to override the veto said voters are tired of the number of constitutional amendments showing up on their ballots, that the state constitution should be reserved for matters pertaining to the structure and powers of government and not for specific policies, and that the constitution should be harder to amend. Multiple lawmakers referenced an amendment last year, rejected by voters, that would have inserted abortion rights into the constitution.
Legislators considered numerous bills this year to restrict citizen lawmaking. Among those that passed into law were a bill to move the deadline for submitting petition signatures for citizen-initiated ballot measures from May to February, which will shorten the signature-gathering window by three months. Legislators also sent a measure to the 2026 ballot that will ask voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendment ballot questions from a simple majority to 60%.
Monday was the last day of this year’s legislative session, set aside to consider any remaining vetoes from Gov. Larry Rhoden. Earlier this month, legislators sustained Rhoden’s only other veto, which would have offered additional child care tuition assistance to child care workers for their own children.

In late March, The Atlantic published a story revealing that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, the news magazine’s editor in chief, to a group chat on the messaging app Signal. That group chat also included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J.D. Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and over a dozen other high-level military and administration officials. In the chat, the officials discussed extremely sensitive details about a series of military airstrikes in Yemen. The leak was immediately lambasted by critics who said the officials were being careless with confidential information and skirting record-keeping laws.
“The Signalgate scandal — and it is a scandal — reflects how reckless and careless this administration is,” Hassan said. “They put our servicemen and women at risk by casually discussing war plans, literally the timing of air strikes on a Signal chain. It’s unacceptable, and as I have said before, it’s one thing to misidentify somebody in a Signal chat when you’re making dinner plans. It’s another thing to do it when you’re planning an airstrike.”
Hassan was one of 20 Democrats who voted to confirm Ratcliffe in January; 24 Democrats voted against him. (One independent, Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, voted for him, and another, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also caucuses with Democrats, voted against him. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania did not vote.)
Hassan wouldn’t say whether the Signal scandal was giving her pause about her vote.
Additionally, Hassan was one of three Democrats (Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire’s other U.S. senator, was another) who voted to confirm Martin Makary, a Johns Hopkins University surgeon and outspoken health care commentator, to his role as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
“Dr. Makary has a very strong record of fighting the opioid epidemic and of holding FDA and past FDA administrators and commissioners to account for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic,” Hassan said. “And I think it was very important to have somebody at the FDA who will continue to work to fight the opioid epidemic as strongly and effectively as he can.”
However, Makary has received criticism from some of Hassan’s fellow Democrats who, in questioning leading up to the vote, couldn’t get the doctor to rule out tightening restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone and were alarmed by his tepid responses on vaccines — which he said he supported but he wanted the FDA to reevaluate how it gathers input from vaccine experts.
Makary previously garnered attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as an outspoken opponent of vaccine mandates, though he supported voluntary vaccinations and other public health measures like shutdowns early in the pandemic and masking. He was also the author of a 2021 Wall Street Journal op-ed that incorrectly predicted the virus would “be mostly gone by April.”
Hassan also discussed the detainment of the German national Fabian Schmidt, who holds a green card and lives in Nashua.
Schmidt was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (a division within the Department of Homeland Security) officials at Boston’s Logan Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island. It is unclear why Schmidt, a 34-year-old man whose parents say he’s lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager, is being detained, but he has a court date set in June.
“We are in contact with the Department of Homeland Security about that,” she said, adding that her and Shaheen’s teams are collaborating. “We have made it clear that DHS needs to follow the law, and we are waiting to get more information from legal representatives of the detainee, but it is very concerning.”
Hassan said she did not know the justification for Schmidt’s detainment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maggiemakary-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

House leaders pulled the bill, saying they received word that the federal government will not change its match. (Rafael Barker | West Virginia Women's Alliance)West Virginia lawmakers on Monday walked back a measure that would have put more than 165,000 residents at risk of losing their health care coverage through Medicaid expansion. 
House Bill 3518 would have put in place a trigger so that if the federal government lowered the rate at which it pays for the Medicaid expansion program, West Virginia residents on the program would be disenrolled and the expansion program would be eliminated. 
The House of Delegates Rules committee moved the bill to the inactive calendar Monday because of strong assurances from the federal government that it will not change its share of the cost, said Deputy House Speaker Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell.
“That bill was, in effect, a message to Washington, and it got communicated back to me Saturday from someone dealing with the negotiations in Washington: they’ve heard us loud and clear. These changes to Medicaid don’t appear as though now they are going to occur,” he told reporters.
Medicaid is a joint health care program between the state and the federal government. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, 41 states, including West Virginia, have expanded their Medicaid programs to cover families who make up to 138% of the federal poverty line. West Virginia expanded its program in 2014. 
The federal government currently matches coverage of those in expanded Medicaid at a 90/10 match. As the federal government considers cuts to Medicaid, at least 12 states have enacted trigger laws like House Bill 3518 in case the federal government decides to lower the rate at which they fund the expansion portion of the program. 
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said leaders are in communication almost daily with the state’s federal delegation.
“We got some very fairly encouraging news over the weekend that the most recent version of what the president and some of the leadership of the current Congress is pursuing doesn’t implicate that bill in the way that we were originally told that it would,” Hanshaw said. “So we didn’t feel a need to move forward at this time.”
Rohrback said he feels confident that the federal government will not change the federal matching rate for the program. 
“I was told Saturday by the congressional people that they have heard a firestorm over this from red states, blue states and purple states,” Rohrbach said. “We are all saying that the federal government made a deal. You’ve got to stay with it if we’re going to have to stay with it. That’s only fair, because the states just cannot absorb that kind of a new budget request.”
The bill originated in the House Finance Committee last week and was advanced to the floor, where it would have been on first reading Monday. 
House Democrats have criticized saying that it would take health care from 160,000 West Virginians, including children, people with disabilities and the elderly.
“This is not what we were sent here to do, but unfortunately after 45 days of doing nothing, the Republicans have tipped their hand as to what their priority is, and that’s to take health care away from nearly 10% of our state,” Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia County, said in a post on social media.  
If the federal government dropped its Medicaid expansion match from 90% to 73%, the rate at which it funds the rest of the program, that would cost the state about $170 million in addition to the $100 million it already pays for Medicaid expansion, officials say. In West Virginia, 166,000 West Virginians are covered under Medicaid expansion. 
Before the bill was pulled, health care advocates and Medicaid recipients gathered outside the House chambers Monday morning to urge lawmakers not to pass it.  
South Charleston resident Paula Lepp and her family would lose health care if Medicaid expansion were to be eliminated in the state. Lepp and her husband, a full-time storyteller, have qualified for Medicaid for a few years since the COVID-19 pandemic led to them losing nearly 80% of their income. Lepp was diagnosed with breast cancer last fall. She’s had several surgeries since then and is scheduled for another on April 18. Now, she worries she won’t have health insurance by then. 
“I’m sitting here worried, stressed out about what that is going to look like for our family,” Lepp said. “What does that look like for my recovery, if we have to choose between finding the money for my surgery and finding the money to continue helping [my daughter] pay for college, or having her go into massive amounts of debt. 
“What a horrible choice that we’re going to have to make,” she said. 
Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Association, said that cutting Medicaid expansion would be devastating to the state’s rural hospitals, five of which are already at immediate risk of closure. 
“A cut like this to our health care delivery system would be catastrophic for those five hospitals,” he said. “So we’re advocating for the House of Delegates to vote no on House Bill 3918.”
According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, Medicaid expansion contributes about a billion every year to the state’s health care economy. 
“[Ending Medicaid expansion] would more than double the state’s uninsured rate, harm health, put hospitals at risk of closure, and likely result in a significant loss of health care jobs throughout the state,” the organization wrote in a post. 
Dan Hager, executive director Ebenizer Medical Outreach, a free and charitable clinic in Huntington that provides care to people without health care and on Medicaid, also spoke against the bill. 
“When we talk about how 166,000 of our friends and neighbors could lose their coverage, I know what that looks like,” Hager said. “That looks like someone you know, someone you go to church with, someone in your family, someone you work with, walking into the pharmacy to pick up their diabetes medicine, to pick up their blood pressure medicine, and finding out they can no longer afford it because they got disenrolled by their insurance coverage and they didn’t even realize. It means someone you know going to the infusion center to get their chemo delivered and be told that they’re not going to be able to get their treatment that day because they no longer have their Medicaid coverage.”

Ron DeSantis administration has pushed.
As the House and Senate begin work on the General Appropriations Act, the one must-pass bill of the year, neither chamber has agreed to an effort by the administration to redirect hundreds of millions in cancer funding away from four National Cancer Institute-designated Florida hospitals to other cancer providers.
The Senate Appropriations Committee will consider legislation (SB 7028) Tuesday that would maintain the existing funding formula for the four NCI-designated hospitals and modify the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative, an initiative promoted by First Lady Casey DeSantis and which  the Legislature agreed to codify into law. 
The Collaborative is located within the Department of Health and is charged with developing a “holistic approach to the state’s efforts to fund cancer research, cancer facilities and treatments for cancer patients.”
The collaborative also plays a role in advising the DOH on the distribution of $60 million in so-called “cancer innovation funds” which are awarded annually.
The details
The Senate bill would place into statute criteria applicants must meet to receive grant funding. They include that hospitals:

Be licensed as a rural hospital or that at least 30% of its cancer patients reside in rural or underserved areas; 
Be licensed as a children’s specialty hospital that provides cancer care; or 
Provides cancer screening services at no cost or a minimal cost to patients.

The Senate bill also requires the DOH to appoint peer review panels of “independent and scientifically qualified individuals” to review the grant applications, to ensure that all proposals for grant funding are “evaluated fairly on the basis of scientific merit.” 
The review panels are required to establish priority scores to be forwarded to members of the collaborative, who must consider the scores in recommending applicants to receive grants.
The Senate bill would create a five-year “incubator” for pediatric cancer research programs that’s overseen by the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative. Children’s specialty hospitals that provide cancer treatment to patients 18 and younger could qualify for the funds. Similar to the innovation grants, the cancer incubator grants would be awarded to applicants that meet the statutory criteria. 
The House bill (HB 5301) is a broad-reaching budget-conforming measure that includes funding-related issues but not specific provisions related to cancer funding. The bill does make changes to the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative, including requiring the collaborative to submit an annual report to the Legislature and governor and to include recommendations for funding for cancer research at specialty hospitals for children. HB 5301 has been referred to the House Budget Committee.
Cancer and Florida
Cancer has been the second-leading cause of death in Florida since 2014. Florida has the third largest population in the country but the second-highest cancer burden, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each year, more than 130,000 new cancer cases are reported to the statewide cancer registry at the Florida Department of Health.
Florida has four NCI–designated research and treatment centers that annually receive $127.5 million in state funds to help them recruit the best and brightest medical minds to advance cancer research. 
This pot of money has been renamed “Casey DeSantis Research Funds” by the Florida Legislature in honor of Ms. DeSantis, who underwent successful treatment for breast cancer. The money goes to Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.
The administration’s long-range plan recommends the $127.5 not be given exclusively to those four providers.
“By expanding access to cancer funding to a broader range of cancer facilities, this transformative process offers the possibility of creating a stronger, broader cancer care network with access for people in rural areas and one that includes pediatric cancer facilities.” the report notes.

[&#8230;]","Iowa Workforce Development manages unemployment claims filed on behalf of Iowans. (Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa nurse who was fired for an alleged pattern of patient neglect is not entitled to unemployment benefits, a judge has ruled.
State records indicate Ashley K. Brooks worked as a registered nurse for Mercy Health Services, which operates four hospital divisions in Iowa, from April 2022 through her termination in early January 2025.
The final incident leading up to her firing occurred on Dec. 30, 2024, when a doctor ordered a urine analysis for a patient shortly after 8 a.m. Brooks allegedly failed to collect the urine sample for several hours, during which time the patient’s husband informed the staff that his wife had become nonverbal.
According to her employer, Brooks was to have checked on the woman multiple times during her shift but either failed to notice the change in the patient’s condition or did not act on it. Brooks collected the sample at 2:45 p.m., after which the patient was taken to the emergency room for a severe urinary tract infection.
Mercy Health Services also alleged Brooks had failed to provide adequate care to patients on several other occasions.
On Dec. 28, 2024, one of Brooks’ patients complained of chest pain and was in need of an EKG and a blood draw before they could be being sent to the emergency room for evaluation. Brooks allegedly sat at the nurse’s desk, scrolling through her phone while three other staff members performed the tasks, although the patient was specifically assigned to Brooks, Mercy Health Services alleged.
On two other occasions, Brooks allegedly failed to take patients’ blood pressure — including one instance in which an aide took the patient’s blood pressure, which registered as 26 over 13 — a level so low it was almost incompatible with life. Although the nurse aide was concerned, Brooks allegedly advised her only to have the patient drink fluids.
Brooks was also accused of falsifying records by indicating she had completed certain tasks that she hadn’t actually performed, and other nurses alleged she regularly failed to perform wound care for diabetic patients, increasing the risk that the patients would lose a limb.
After she was fired, Brooks applied for unemployment benefits, which led to a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Stephanie Adkisson.
Recently, Adkisson ruled Brooks was not entitled to jobless benefits, finding that Mercy Health Services had presented credible evidence that Brooks “failed to provide proper care to patients — including ignoring dangerously low blood pressure, chest pains, and wound care. As a registered nurse, (Brooks) was aware of the reasonable standards of care. (Her) conduct was clearly against the best interest of the employer and its patients.”
State records indicate that Brooks’ Iowa license remains active and unencumbered, with no history of disciplinary action by the Iowa Board of Nursing.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

Free.,Democrats ask congressional watchdog agency to probe Trump’s funding freezes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-ask-congressional-watchdog-agency-probe-trumps-funding-freezes,,"WASHINGTON — Top Democrats in Congress are asking the Government Accountability Office to open an investigation into whether the Trump administration violated federal law by freezing funding for several programs.Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking members on the House and Senate Budget committees, wrote in a two-page letter sent Monday to the government watchdog organization that certain actions appear to have violated the Impoundment Control Act.“Unilaterally impounding funds is illegal, and Donald Trump and Russ Vought are trying to gut the federal government piece by piece,” Merkley wrote in a statement accompanying the letter. “GAO must get to the bottom of this and reiterate to the administration that Congress has the power of the purse, not Trump and Vought.”The Senate voted along party lines earlier this year to confirm Vought as director of the Office of Management and Budget, which has wide-reaching authority over decisions within the executive branchA Government Accountability Office spokesperson told States Newsroom the agency is working through its process to determine whether it will launch an investigation based on the letter.GAO, the spokesperson said, also has ongoing work related to the ICA.OMB authorityBoyle wrote in a statement that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to determine when and where the federal government spends money.“The administration’s withholding of critical investments harms American communities that rely on these funds for jobs, economic stability, and essential infrastructure,” Boyle wrote. “Robust congressional oversight, alongside litigation, is vital to protecting the interests of the American people.”The Impoundment Control Act, enacted in the 1970s, bars presidents from not spending the money that Congress has appropriated. Vought has said repeatedly he believes the law is unconstitutional and that presidents have this authority.Several lawsuits have been filed over the Trump administration opting not to spend federal money, some of which have blocked the actions from taking effect while the cases proceed through the federal courts. The Boyle-Merkley letter alleges the Trump administration has run afoul of the law on several occasions, including on his first day in office when he ordered a pause on foreign development assistance as well as funding in the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law.The two ask GAO to also look into the Trump administration’s decision to halt military aid to Ukraine for about a week in March, writing they are “concerned this pause may have been an illegal impoundment with negative foreign policy and national security implications.”“The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation,” Boyle and Merkley wrote in the letter. “Instead, Congress has vested the President with strictly circumscribed authority to impound or withhold budget authority only in limited circumstances as expressly provided in the Impoundment Control Act.“The executive branch may withhold amounts from obligation only if the President transmits a special message to Congress that includes the amount of budget authority proposed for withholding and the reason for the proposal (2 U.S.C. §§ 683–684).”What can GAO do?During the first Trump administration, the GAO found the Office of Management and Budget violated the Impoundment Control Act  when it halted assistance to Ukraine.“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” GAO wrote in the report. “OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”The GAO writes on its website that the ICA “authorizes the head of GAO, known as the Comptroller General, to file a lawsuit if the President illegally impounds funds.”Comptroller General Gene Dodaro testified before Congress earlier this year that he plans to do just that if the independent agency finds violations of the ICA.“We’re going to make these decisions as fast as possible,” Dodaro said, according to a news report. “I fully intend to carry out our responsibilities under the Impoundment Control Act expeditiously and thoroughly . . . I’ll do it as quickly as I can, but we need to be careful and thorough, because the next step for us is to go to court ourselves. If we say there’s been impoundment and money isn’t released in a certain period of time, we have to go to court.”",,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers. 
And, he said, soda is the “number one commodity spent on SNAP.”
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws. 
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 48-20 vote on Monday, after the chamber had already narrowly approved the bill. It came back to the House after the Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition. The Idaho Senate passed an amended version of the bill on a 25-10 vote last week.
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, critiqued the bill as another way to control poor people. 
Sen. Camille Blaylock, R-Caldwell, suggested it isn’t likely Idaho would make the change alone. Idaho’s waiver, she argued, would join other states’ requests, applying pressure for a nationwide change. 
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.

 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight. 
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, contain milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact.
Republican legislators in Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming introduced similar bills, Stateline reported.

Sophie Warren believes that the transition to clean energy needs to prioritize such economic justice issues to ensure no one is left behind in the state’s efforts to address climate change.  Last session, the Scarborough Democrat introduced a bill that [&#8230;]","A worker installs a heat pump, which have been a key feature of Maine's transition to cleaner energy. (Photo via Oregon Department of Energy)While the struggle for low-income residents to afford their power bill is not new, Rep. Sophie Warren believes that the transition to clean energy needs to prioritize such economic justice issues to ensure no one is left behind in the state’s efforts to address climate change. 
Last session, the Scarborough Democrat introduced a bill that sought to bolster support for low-income residents to access energy efficiency and weatherization programs. 
Although that bill died, part of what Warren had hoped to achieve eventually came to fruition when the Maine Climate Council for the first time included in updated Climate Action Plan strategies to lower the energy burden on Maine residents. 
Though Warren applauds that work, she introduced LD 1037 to go a step further by requiring the climate council to include in its annual report to lawmakers specific recommendations for how to reduce the portion of Mainers’ income that is being spent on electricity and home heating fuels.
During a public hearing for the proposal Monday, Warren told members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee that she wants to ensure the work continues into the future, regardless of who sits on the council or serves in the executive branch.
“As a small, rural state with higher-than-average rates of poverty and some of the highest comparative, I both believe it is a moral imperative we fight poverty alongside climate change but also that to do so is economical in the long run,” Warren said. 
For low-income households in Maine, the average energy burden is 14% based on 2018-2022 data, according to the Maine Energy Plan published in January. That is nearly three times higher than the statewide average across all income levels. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce supports Warren’s bill, encouraging what they described as a “thoughtful” shift to clean energy that doesn’t inadvertently increase costs for Maine businesses, said Maine Chamber Government Relations Specialist Ashley Luszczki.
For example, she pointed to energy intensive businesses, such as manufacturers and food processors, that rely on cost-effective, reliable energy to stay competitive. Despite the state’s current statutory goal of using 80% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050, renewable sources don’t provide the affordable and consistent baseload power large-scale industrial operations need, Luszczki said.
In 2023, Gov. Janet Mills called for those timelines to be moved up, asking instead for the state to strive for 100% clean energy by 2040. The chamber sees Warren’s bill as a way to meet climate goals while lowering energy costs. 
“A strong economy and a sustainable environmental future must go hand in hand,” Luszczki said.
The Office of Public Advocate, which advocates for Maine utility ratepayers, also supports this bill, saying that the affordability of energy must be taken into account when considering new climate policy. 
While the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future — which manages the Maine Climate Council — agrees with the goal of the legislation, it is opposed to the proposal. Current law already requires the council to consider household energy burden and affordability, argued Senior Advisor Brian Hubbell. 
Additionally, the most recent climate action plan from November 2024 includes multiple strategies and recommendations in those areas, including one to “comprehensively analyze household energy burden in Maine in 2025, including all energy sources, and set a target for reducing the energy burden for low-income residents by January 2026.”
Even with those recommendations already spelled out, Warren said her proposal is still necessary because it would commit in statute the prioritization of considering poverty in climate efforts. 
“I see formalizing this additional consideration of energy burden within the Council’s framework and ensuring it remains in statute as its own distinct priority is key to achieving the long-term commitment,” Warren said.
If there is a need for a more detailed analysis of energy burden and how to reduce it, Hubbell said it would be more appropriate for the Governor’s Energy Office to complete that work and include it in its biennial energy plan.  
The most recent iteration of that plan published in January also already includes recommendations for reducing the energy burden on low- and moderate-income households.

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The new commissioners set to regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska, as well as the ballot sponsors of the successful effort to legalize it in 2024, blasted an ongoing lawsuit against them as “meritless” and seeking to create a “false conflict.”
In briefs filed Friday, attorneys for the 11 defendants named in the John Kuehn v. Gov. Jim Pillen case explained why they are seeking to dismiss the case. 
Kuehn, a former state senator, former State Board of Health member and longtime marijuana opponent, filed the case in December. It sought to declare the voter-approved legalization and regulation of medical cannabis unconstitutional. He expanded the case in January to encompass more state officials.
The lawsuit’s main argument is that the Nebraska laws are unlawful, or preempted, because of the federal Controlled Substances Act.


The legal filings so far
John Kuehn initial lawsuit (filed Dec. 10)
John Kuehn amended lawsuit (filed Jan. 10)
State officials brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)
Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)
Ballot sponsors brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)


Typically, cases can only move forward if the party suing can prove direct harm because of the laws, known as “standing.”
Kuehn has conceded he can’t prove standing directly, so to get his foot in the door, he is arguing that his case has standing on behalf of the “taxpayer” or “great public interest,” narrow paths for certain cases to proceed. The first standard regards the spending of public dollars, while the second argues the matter should be taken up because it is of a “great public interest” to Nebraskans.
The lawyers for five state officials, the three commissioners on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and the three ballot sponsors said neither type of standing applies to Kuehn.
“There is no ‘great public interest’ in invalidating a law approved by a massive supermajority of Nebraska voters which will be susceptible to challenge by many,” the attorney wrote for Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, Harry Hoch, Jr. of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Kuehn’s legal team had no immediate comment on the new filings. His team has until late April to file a response under a briefing order by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong. Strong, who ruled against Kuehn in an earlier marijuana-related case, has scheduled an in-person hearing on the motions to dismiss the preemption case for May 20.
The role of Congress
The sponsors of the medical cannabis ballot measure criticized Kuehn’s lawsuit as an attempt “to flip federalism on its head.” They said Kuehn “supports an expansive federal government and a weakened state government at the expense of Nebraska voters who just passed two laws by huge margins.”
Voters overwhelmingly approved the measure to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation with 71% support. It secured majority support in all of Nebraska’s 49 legislative districts. A second measure to regulate medical cannabis through the newly created commission passed with 67% support, including majority support in 46 legislative districts.

Campaign attorneys said the federal government — under presidents from former President Bill Clinton to President Donald Trump earlier this year — has never taken the preemption position.
The federal government still lists marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, though the Trump and Biden administrations have taken steps toward reclassifying the drug.
The U.S. Department of Justice has also not prosecuted violations of federal cannabis law in states that have legalized marijuana, the ballot sponsors’ attorneys wrote. Congress has also annually prohibited the Justice Department from spending funds to prevent states from implementing medical cannabis laws.
“Congress’s purpose is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case, and here, Congress has decided to allow states to enact their own medical cannabis laws,” the ballot sponsors said.
Protecting ‘state sovereignty’
Attorney Jason Grams of Omaha, for the commissioners, said that while it is true that marijuana possession, manufacture and distribution are federally illegal, “that is far from the end of the analysis.”
Grams said preemption in this case, as Congress has designed it in the Controlled Substances Act, is implicated when it is “physically impossible” for a state law to coexist with federal law.
In the 39 states that have legalized medical cannabis, including Nebraska last fall, none has been thrown out on federal preemption standards, the commissioners said.
“We simply hold state sovereignty in greater regard than that,” Grams wrote.
Lawmakers, advocates mull medical cannabis regs to prevent ‘Wild West’ in Nebraska

Grams represented the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign in 2020 against a lawsuit brought by Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled against the campaign and removed the measure off the ballot. 
The campaign tried again in 2022 and 2024 before succeeding at the ballot box.
Ballot sponsors have similarly pointed to the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
The AG’s Office did not address federal preemption in its motion to dismiss other than to say that “Kuehn may be correct on the merits of his substantive challenges.”

The ballot sponsors said Kuehn is in an “odd position” of being a Nebraska taxpayer suing “not to vindicate the rights of his fellow taxpayers but to secure the rights of the federal government.”
“Unlike most taxpayer lawsuits, success for Kuehn would not save taxpayers money — to the contrary, Kuehn’s success would decrease tax revenue, thereby increasing the per capita tax burden and harming taxpayers,” the brief states. “The federal government, not a resident taxpayer, is the interested party.”
No taxpayer dollars, yet
Another challenge in taking up Kuehn’s case now, Grams added, is pending legislation being considered by the Nebraska Legislature, which could render “moot” the statutes that Kuehn is challenging. He said Kuehn’s arguments against the commissioners “are aiming at a moving target.”
The main proposal, Legislative Bill 677 from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, has not yet advanced from the General Affairs Committee. A vote on whether to advance the bill could come this week.
The commission also has no public dollars set aside to carry out its duties — no state funds, no donations, no fee revenue, no office, no address, no contact information, no equipment, no staff.
“No ability to carry out any duties set forth in the NMRCA [Nebraska Medical Cannabis Regulation Act],” the brief continues.

Up until Friday, with a “complete lack of resources,” the commissioners have:

Executed no contracts.
Held no meetings.
Advertised for no meetings.
Carried on no deliberations.
Held no votes.
Issued no regulations.
Commenced no work on regulations.
Sought no office or meeting space.
Sought to hire no employees.
Began no work on the criteria for licensure.
Retained no law enforcement resources.

As approved by voters, commissioners must craft regulations for licensure by July 1, which is three months away. Licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1. Under a pending bill, those deadlines could be extended and the commission could receive appropriations.
Members of the new Medical Cannabis Commission said the argument that the potential use of future taxpayer dollars is enough to move the case forward is “bunkum,” or nonsense.
The ballot sponsors’ attorneys said allowing the case to proceed could implicate the “incidental expenditures” of any state law and could allow any challenge to any law. They said allowing Kuehn to move forward on “taxpayer standing” grounds “would effectively swallow the rule — contrary to the Supreme Court’s instruction to apply the exception narrowly.”
If Kuehn is seeking to prevent someone from appropriating funds, the commissioners said, then Kuehn “has sued the wrong parties” and instead “must address his claim to the Legislature.”
Regulations in limbo
There’s also a technical fight for the commissioners, with Grams arguing that none of the commissioners was properly served as part of the case. 
Kuehn’s mostly out-of-state attorneys sent “legal threat” letters on Jan. 9, one day before the commissioners were added to the lawsuit, telling them not to enforce the laws.

However, the letter was sent to email addresses that Kuehn “guessed at” but that the commissioners don’t have access to, was mailed to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission where the commissioners have dual roles at (but is separate) and was left with a woman in the AG’s Office, but not with the commissioners.
None of the commissioners had seen the legal threat telling the commissioners not to act until “long after” Jan. 10, the brief states, and Kuehn didn’t give “even a day to consider his demand, if he gave them a chance to review it at all.”
A pledged future challenge
In addition to Pillen, the AG’s Office is also defending Secretary of State Bob Evnen, CEO Steve Corsi of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, State Treasurer Tom Briese and Tax Commissioner Jim Kamm.
The AG’s Office said Evnen can’t be sued in a duplicative case on the topic. Kuehn continues to appeal his defeated lawsuit against Evnen and the campaign from last September.

Kuehn included Corsi arguing that DHHS would need to discipline doctors who recommend cannabis to patients. While DHHS has not issued guidance to physicians as part of the laws, the AG’s Office said recommending cannabis would open up Nebraska doctors to discipline.
The lawsuit argues that Briese and Kamm could violate money laundering laws if they collect tax revenue from medical marijuana sales, but all three attorney groups said courts have long upheld the collection of such taxes, including on illegal activity.
Rather than Kuehn, the AG’s Office argued, there is another person who would be better suited to challenge the laws: Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
Acting Deputy Solicitor General Zachary Pohlman, joining Hilgers in defending the state officials, appeared before the Legislature earlier this month. 
Pohlman then and again in the latest brief pledged — or in the view of some lawmakers, threatened — to challenge the constitutionality of the laws if the commission licensed medical cannabis establishments. The brief said that a lawsuit was but “one example” of future action.
“Expanding taxpayer standing to allow a private plaintiff to sue public officials to invalidate statutes that do not harm the plaintiff when the attorney general has pledged to do so himself not only stretches the judiciary’s jurisdiction beyond its proper scope,” the brief states. “It also tramples upon the authority of Nebraska’s chief law enforcement officer.”

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)The Oregon Legislature is expected to advance two bills this week that could provide electric utilities with a financial safety net and some level of protection from bankruptcy-inducing lawsuits if their equipment starts a catastrophic fire.
The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
 Oregon Legislature considers two bills related to wildfire, utilities

Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland, and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”
 PacifiCorp’s involvement on Oregon bills

In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.

Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
 Starting with Utah legislation

PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
 Reasonable and prudent

Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.



 How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?

In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association.
Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund.
The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities.
PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

Minnesota’s increasing costs are outpacing revenues and could cause a projected $6 billion budget deficit in the two years beginning in July 2027.
Democratic and Republican leaders, who share power in the 67-67 House, negotiated a compromise that would leave $1.6 billion on the bottom line over the next two years and would reduce the projected budget deficit to $1.3 billion in the following biennium.
Inflation is expected to create another $1.1 billion in expenses for the state in the upcoming budget, but lawmakers say they won’t be providing inflation adjustments to agency budgets except where required by law.
That means cuts will be more widespread and deeper than reflected in the targets, as agencies will face rising costs without money appropriated to cover them. State workers — whose compensation typically comprises the bulk of many agency budgets — are sure to demand pay raises that keep up with inflation, for instance. Overall, the House’s budget framework would cut $3.7 billion from the state’s budget over the next four years.
Senate Democrats released their budget targets on Friday and also didn’t account for inflation.
Budget targets are guidelines for legislative committees, which will then add specificity to agency budgets. Targets are subject to change, and often do, as lawmakers create their biennial budget in the remaining weeks of session. The Legislature must pass a budget by June 30, though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.
Spending on Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program, makes up nearly 30% of the state’s budget. The use of disability waivers, which provide services to the elderly and disabled, is rapidly increasing, as is the per-person cost of providing care. 
Budget officials estimate that if the state continues on its current trajectory, spending on Medical Assistance and DHS programs will grow from around $22 billion in the current budget to more than $27 billion by the 2028-29 budget.
Gov. Tim Walz, House leaders and the Senate DFL are all in agreement that the state should target DHS spending in order to avert a deficit. State law requires DHS to adjust disability waiver payouts for inflation every two years; Walz wants to cap the inflation adjustments at 2% per year, likely below the real inflation rate. 
That would save an estimated $1.3 billion over the next four years — the same as the House budget targets — though House leaders would not confirm that Walz’s proposal was included in the targets.
The cost of Medical Assistance is shared with the federal government, but if President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to pass their planned tax cuts, they’ll almost certainly have to cut federal Medicaid spending. That means Minnesota would have to spend more to maintain current levels of service, or cut services.
The House targets include spending cuts on health and human services, environment and a mandate that the House Taxes Committee reduce tax subsidies and/or the Local Government Aid program, or increase taxes, which Republicans oppose.
“We’re holding strong against tax increases. We know that Minnesotans are overtaxed, and we can’t put more burden onto Minnesotans at this point,” said House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring.
Demuth said the “targets are an absolute win” and praised the spending reductions.
House Ways and Means co-chair Rep. Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, said the House could have avoided cuts in the health and human services, which will affect the most vulnerable Minnesotans, if Republicans were willing to adopt tax increases.
“These budget targets represent a compromise between Democrats and Republicans, and if Democrats were setting targets on our own, these targets would look very different. We would have asked the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share in order to make additional needed investments in public education and affordable health care,” said DFL House leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, at a Capitol press conference Monday.
With the bipartisan House agreement, the Legislature is well-positioned to finish a budget by the May 19 adjournment deadline.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2099-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-03-31 16:04:35.747665

(Main photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch.

The surcharge, which is alleged to be $35 per pay period, amounts to an illegal “cash grab” by Casey’s that is masquerading as a wellness program, the lawsuit claims.
Filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the lawsuit seeks class-action status but is currently filed on behalf of one Casey’s employee, Elizabeth Blalock of Carroll County, Missouri.
Attorneys for Blalock allege that all Casey’s workers are automatically assumed to use tobacco unless they submit to a process in which they provide a sworn affidavit stating they do not. Any worker who fails to complete that process by a specified deadline is then required to pay “tobacco surcharge” for the entire calendar year, even if they do not use tobacco, the lawsuit claims.
In addition, Casey’s allegedly fails to provide the federally required options that would allow employees to avoid the surcharge. “The surcharge is structured as a penalty rather than a legitimate wellness incentive,” the lawsuit claims, since the workers “who miss the enrollment deadline are penalized for the entire year without any opportunity to later demonstrate compliance or avoid the surcharge.”
The lawsuit is based on the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA allows employers to deduct from workers’ pay a tobacco-use surcharge, but only in connection with wellness programs that meet specific federal guidelines established in 2014. Those regulations state they are intended to ensure corporate wellness programs actually promote health as opposed to being a “subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor.”
The lawsuit alleges Casey’s is illegally shifting the costs associated with less healthy workers from the company back to those same workers “who end up subsidizing their healthier colleagues.”
ERISA bars any health insurer or medical plan from discriminating against participants by charging premiums based on a “health-related factor,” including tobacco use. It does, however, allow group health plans to establish premium discounts or rebates” in return for adherence to programs that promote wellness and disease prevention.
Casey’s, the lawsuit claims, does not meet that standard.
“There is no smoking-cessation program, waiver, or alternative route for tobacco users” to avoid the surcharge, the lawsuit alleges. “The only avenue for smokers to avoid the surcharge is to quit smoking and then submit that change in status to the benefits department. Thus, tobacco users are penalized based solely on their status as smokers, which violates ERISA’s nondiscrimination provisions.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that “allowing companies like Casey’s to exploit their participants and unlawfully extract millions from them under the guise of a wellness program that is, in reality, a cash grab, directly contradicts ERISA’s purpose of protecting workers from health-based discrimination. If unchecked, this practice would permit employers to manipulate wellness programs as revenue generating schemes rather than genuine health initiatives.”
According to the lawsuit, Blalock has forfeited to Casey’s $35 in earnings per pay period — roughly $910 per year — in order to maintain health coverage through the company.
Casey’s, which is headquartered in Ankeny, is one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, with more than 2,600 locations in 16 states. There are more than 18,000 employees enrolled in the company’s health plan, according to court records.
In seeking class-action status for their lawsuit, the plaintiff’s attorneys argue the amount of money at issue exceeds $5 million, and the number of Casey’s workers who might potentially join the case is more than 1,000.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful imposition of a discriminatory tobacco surcharge and breach of fiduciary duty. Casey’s has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The company did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment.
The plaintiff is represented by attorney Adam J. Wachal of the Koley Jessen law firm in Omaha.

Appearing on stage in front of more than 1,000 people and wearing a cheesehead hat, Musk, who has spent more than $20 million supporting the candidacy of conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, gave out the money at a rally in Green Bay Sunday night. From the stage, Musk  said the race, which will decide the ideological balance of the Court, could “affect the entire destiny of humanity.” 
Aside from the two checks he gave out on Sunday, America PAC, the political action committee Musk has used to funnel money into the race, offered Wisconsin voters $100 each to fill out a petition against “activist judges” and provide contact information. Musk’s money has also been used to hire people from out-of-state to knock on doors on behalf of Schimel and blanket the state in ads. 
Democrats and Schimel’s opponent, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, have accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the Court, pointing out that Musk’s company, Tesla, is currently fighting a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin over its law that prevents car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. 
Musk said the $1 million giveaway was a strategy to get attention on the race. 
“We need to get attention,” he said. “Somewhat inevitably, when I do these things, it causes the legacy media to kind of lose their minds.”
Wisconsin state law includes provisions that make it illegal to offer people money in exchange for voting. In an initial post on his social media site, X, Musk said that the winners of the money would need to prove they had voted. He later deleted that post and updated the contest so that people only had to complete the America PAC petition. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to block the giveaway, alleging that it violated state law against election bribery. Judges at the circuit, appellate and Supreme Court levels declined to step in. 
Musk’s involvement in the race has become one of the campaign’s major issues as voters are about to head to the polls. The state Democratic party has held People v. Musk town halls across the state as liberals worry about Musk’s involvement in the election and his DOGE agency’s work to cut funds at a variety of federal agencies.

(Photo by Jason Cameron/Getty Images)The Oregon Legislature is expected to advance two bills this week that could provide electric utilities with a financial safety net and some level of protection from bankruptcy-inducing lawsuits if their equipment starts a catastrophic fire.
The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”
PacifiCorp involvement
In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.
Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
Starting with Utah
PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
Reasonable and prudent
Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.
 


How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?

	
In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund. The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities. PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas officials on Monday said they plan to close a loophole in federal election law that allows foreign nationals to contribute money toward ballot measures, in the latest move aimed at overhauling the state’s ballot process.
House Bill 1837, sponsored by Rep. Mindy McAlindon, R-Centerton, would require an “affirmation” from the individual or organization making a donation that it “has not knowingly or willfully accepted funds in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in the aggregate from one (1) or more prohibited sources within the four-year period immediately preceding” the donation.
The bill defines a “prohibited source” as a political action committee that accepts at least one contribution from a foreign national, an organization funded by a PAC that receives a donation from a foreign national, contributions from a foreign national and contributions that violate state or federal law.
The bill will go before the House State Agencies and Government Affairs Committee later this week, McAlindon said, where she expects the Legislature’s “full support.”
Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester said in a press conference Monday morning that “foreign billionaires have been donating tens and hundreds of billions of dollars to statewide ballot initiatives across this country, including Arkansas.”
“In fact, a single Swiss billionaire, Hansjörg Wyss, has spent over $100 million in ballot initiatives across the country in an effort to remake the American Constitution in what he called a progressive vision,” Jester said.
(The Wyss Foundation is one of the supporters of States Newsroom.) 
While many state constitutions can be altered via direct democracy processes, the United States Constitution can only be changed via a specific process that does not include voting in an election.
Jester cited President Donald Trump’s recent executive order targeting election processes.
“President Trump has taken action on this in his recent executive order on election security,” Jester said. “He said that the foreign funding [of] ballot initiatives is a serious problem that states need to address. It’s unacceptable. In Arkansas, if you are a wealthy foreign national, we welcome your tourism, we welcome your friendship, but our constitution is not for sale.”

ARFairWage2018-08-15-combined-combined-compressed 
However, when asked, Jester only cited $1.34 million in donations from the 1630 Fund in 2018, an American nonprofit that is part of a network of left-leaning so-called “dark money” groups. He said the Swiss billionaire made donations to the 1630 Fund in 2018.
He said that Arkansans should know that “the person taking your signature was most likely funded by a Swiss billionaire who has never stepped foot in our great state.” However, Jester specifically said the issue he described with foreign funding of ballot measures wasn’t an issue during the 2024 election, although he anticipated that would not remain the case in future election cycles.
When requested, Jester’s office provided filings made by Arkansans For A Fair Wage during the 2018 election cycle, which showed that the 1630 Fund donated just over $1.34 million on $1.5 million in total donations received by the ballot committee. There’s no indication that any of Wyss’ donations to the 1630 Fund were included in the money the nonprofit gave to the Arkansas ballot committee. 
According to the 1630 Fund’s IRS Form 990, which nonprofits file each year, the fund received $143.3 million in contributions in 2018 alone, with $141.39 million in expenses.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Monday ordered the dismissal of a longstanding Department of Justice lawsuit challenging Republican Georgia lawmakers’ overhaul of the state’s election laws in 2021.
Bondi said in a statement Monday that the federal lawsuit against Senate Bill 202 will be dismissed because it contained false claims that the Georgia election legislation was a politically motivated retaliation against Black voters and other Democratic-leaning voters who supported Democratic President Joe Biden.
Biden narrowly won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes.
Republican legislators defended changes they made to Georgia’s election as part of an effort to restore public confidence in elections by tightening absentee ballot requirements, improving voter security and other aspects of the voting process.
Bondi is dismissing the Biden-era lawsuit challenging a law that critics called “Jim Crow 2.0.”
The turnout of Black voters in Georgia actually increased following the passage of the election overhaul, Bondi said.
“Contrary to the Biden Administration’s false claims of suppression, Black voter turnout actually increased under SB 202,” she said. “Georgians deserve secure elections, not fabricated claims of false voter suppression meant to divide us. Americans can be confident that this Department of Justice will protect their vote and never play politics with election integrity.”
Various progressive voting and civil right organizations and the Democratic Party targeted SB 202, a package of nearly several election bills Republican lawmakers pushed through with only five days left in the 2021 legislative session.
Georgia’s controversial 2021 voting law overhaul survives preliminary legal challenge

Prior to the 2024 election cycle, a Georgia federal court judge declined to temporarily block the state’s controversial election rules.
Trump won a second term in the White House in 2024 after securing 312 electoral votes to defeat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Georgia cast all 16 of its electoral votes for Trump.

Gretchen Whitmer wrapped up a weeklong mission in the United Kingdom and Ireland aimed at strengthening foreign economic relationships while state Republican lawmakers criticize her for being a “frequent flyer”.
This investment expedition is the latest venture in a string of economic-focused trips in recent months, including a trip aimed to build economic partnerships in Spain in November and a mission to seek out partnership opportunities in the United Arab Emirates in February. 
The European trip included meetings with industry and business leaders, as well as government officials to discuss collaborations in tourism and agribusiness, as well as defense and aerospace manufacturing, a news release from Whitmer’s office said.
The goal is to place Michigan at the forefront of innovation, Whitmer said in the release, placing the state in the best position to build upon its legacy of excellence in manufacturing and leadership in the agriculture industry.
“I was proud to travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland to strengthen our relationships with business and government leaders, tell our story, and make the case for Michigan as the best place to innovate, build the future, and grow,” Whitmer said.
Whitmer had a delegation of leaders from Michigan on the trip with her including the directors of the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development and the Department of Natural Resources.
Efforts to connect with Michigan’s partners across the globe reinforces Michigan as a go-to ally in economic development,  CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation Quentin L. Messer, Jr said. 
“Whether in tourism, agribusiness or advanced manufacturing, by engaging directly with business and government leaders, Team Michigan is demonstrating our commitment to companies currently with Michigan presences and encouraging new ones to establish presences, while showcasing our world-class workforce, infrastructure, innovation ecosystem and location advantage,”  Messer said.
But as Michigan leaders across the political aisle tackle the issue of growing the state’s slow-growing population and making Michigan a prime choice to live and work, some state lawmakers say Whitmer ought to focus on domestic needs rather than racking up “frequent flyer miles.”
While Michigan’s international image may be dazzling, Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) encouraged Michigan’s governor to lower her sunglasses long enough to see all the issues in Michigan that he says require her executive attention, offered in a tongue-in-cheek special tribute resolution “To Express Admiration for the Governor’s Tireless Commitment to International Visits and Frequent Flyer Programs”.
Kunse’s special tribute implores Whitmer to recognize that there is more than enough work that needs to be done in Michigan that ought to take precedence over international relations. Further, Michiganders are still waiting on Whitmer to deliver on her promise of a long term road funding plan and improvements in education and lowering the costs of living.

“While Michigan residents are busy dodging potholes, it’s reassuring to know that our governor is off admiring the roads of Europe,” Kunse said in a statement. “International diplomacy is alive and well, thanks to her firm belief that state business is best conducted from a poolside cabana located anywhere but Michigan.”
In order to bolster transparency and efficiency of overseas trips made by the governor, Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) introduced a bill Thursday that would require a majority vote in both the state House and Senate to approve state funding for such trips.
House Bill 4310 would also require the governor’s office to submit the destination of travel, what the dates are of travel and the purpose of the excursion.
Whitmer’s office was asked about the GOP response to the trade trip, but did not return a request for comment by the time of publication.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.

Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

About 25 million Americans live in dentist shortage areas, according to new research from Harvard University. (Katie Adkins for KFF Health News)In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.
Overlapping ‘dental deserts’ and fluoride-free zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
[Editor’s note: As the map below indicates, CDC data list three North Carolina counties as locations in which most of the pubic is consuming unflouridated water: Currituck, Tyrell and Stokes. At least two other counties — Lincoln and Union, which respective dentist shortage areas of 18% and 11% — have taken action in recent months to join this list.] 



The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.

Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride seen as a great public health achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.
Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and states rethink fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
Methodology: How we counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

(Illustration by Leslie Bonilla/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers could ban all marijuana advertising within state lines, under an amendment adopted Monday in a transportation-focused committee. It goes beyond the billboard-specific prohibition taken in a Senate panel last week.
Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said his community is “inundated” with billboards advertising illegal marijuana. The district is near Michigan, which has legalized it.
But that’s not all.
“My constituents, myself included, receive up to two — what would look like political mailers — a week advertising an illegal substance” at dispensaries in nearby New Buffalo, per Pressel. He chairs the House Roads and Transportation Committee.
He commandeered Senate Bill 73, dealing with utility trailer sales, for an amendment outlawing the advertising of marijuana and other drugs on Indiana’s list of Schedule I controlled substances. Indiana’s attorney general could sue for injunctions, civil penalties of up to $15,000 and “reasonable costs” incurred throughout the investigation and lawsuit.

“I’ve heard about (how) the First Amendment, I’m trampling on it. I don’t believe that to be true,” Pressel told the committee. He cited a federal appeals court decision that, “basically, if it’s a criminal activity, you have no First Amendment right to advertise. That’s my understanding.”
The ban would take effect upon the bill’s passage. Advertising from contracts entered into or renewed before the approval date would be exempt.
The committee accepted the edits by consent.
Pressel told reporters that the panel “deal(s) with billboard issues all the time,” but acknowledged that his amendment would also affect mailers, truck adverts, television and more. It also has the potential to impact online activity.
“We’re able to geofence a lot of different things. … So is it possible to geofence that out? I believe that it is, but can’t confirm,” Pressel said. “I haven’t talked to those folks.”
Pressel authored an additional amendment inserting tweaked towing regulations into Senate Bill 73. The proposal was advanced on a 12-0 vote.
Intersection opposition appeased
When opposition to a rural intersection safety measure erupted too close to the legislative session’s first-half deadlines, its author promised he’d fix it — or kill it. Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield, developed the measure after his friends’ eldest son was killed in a crash along an uncontrolled intersection overgrown with tall corn.
A thorough amendment, taken by consent Monday, appeared to ease concerns from farmers.
Rural intersections sightline proposal to rack up edits

Senate Bill 183 initially mandated large “line of sight triangles” by uncontrolled intersections to be kept clear of crops, vegetation and other obstructions above 3 feet tall. Units of government would’ve sent landowners or renters notice for noncompliance. People involved in vehicle crashes resulting from blocked sightlines would’ve been able to sue for damages.
An amendment replaced the triangle concept with a “line of sight area.” That would be, at minimum, the 20 feet of road right-of-way extending on each side from the center line. The 3-foot rule would still apply for 55 feet along each road from the center of the intersection.
If a local government decides a landowner or lessee isn’t compliant, it would have seven days to send written notice through certified mail. The person or entity responsible for the land would have seven days after receiving notice to clear the sightlines.
Otherwise, the local government could take “corrective action” — and, if warned a second time or more for the same property, charge up to $500 per subsequent clearing.
“We have worked very diligently with stakeholders on … making sure that a traveling motorist doesn’t have an obstructed view when they get to an intersection,” Pressel said. “So, lots of time, lots of hours, have gone into this amendment.”
An Indiana Farm Bureau representative said the edits had softened the group’s opposition into neutrality.

That was the message from Gov. Jeff Landry and the Louisiana Republican Party before and after Saturday’s election that saw voters resoundingly reject four constitutional amendments. In their eyes, the Hungarian-born billionaire who conservatives bash for all things left-leaning was also responsible for their failed referendum. 
Sure, if you want to connect the faint dots, a Soros organization did make a substantial donation in 2023 to an offshoot of one of the groups in a coalition that opposed the amendments. But there’s no way of knowing if that money from two years ago was spent on this Louisiana election.    
The results were particularly disappointing to Landry, who spent much of his time over the past month on the chamber of commerce luncheon circuit campaigning for Amendment 2. Among the many things the convoluted proposal would have done is substantially reconfigure the state’s tax and budget laws.










We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure.


– Gov. Jeff Landry


Boiled down from 115 pages to fit on an election ballot, the overwhelming consensus was Amendment 2 was too much for voters to digest.
“The ballot language does not explain the extensive breadth and depth of the amendment’s impact,” the neutral Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana wrote in its breakdown for Amendment 2. Its analyses are the widely accepted gold standard for translating such ballot proposals into plain English. 
The governor, however, didn’t see it that way.   
“Unfortunately, Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,” Landry said in a statement Saturday night. “Although we are disappointed in tonight’s results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure.”
It’s a rather odd choice of words from someone who voters overwhelmingly put into office without a runoff less than 18 months ago.  
While it’s not surprising that Landry would lean on the GOP’s tried-and-tired Soros slander, his bashing of the Louisiana electorate came off as rather judgmental. Tell us you think little of voters, governor, without saying you think little of voters.
Echoing his condescending tone ahead of the election was the state Republican Party. Rather than attempt to explain Amendment 2 to voters – admittedly, a near-impossible task – the LAGOP doubled down on scare tactics in emails sent to members Friday and Saturday.
“Did you know: George Soros is funding FAKE NEWS campaigns against Amendment 2 on the March 29 ballot?” Friday’s message read.
No one expected the governor and Republicans to acknowledge the unpopularity of the four amendments. But Saturday’s election results send the clear message that voters, regardless of party, have grown tired of such propaganda. 
Maybe it has something to do with the Republican president running roughshod over the U.S. Constitution in his first two months in office and failing to deliver on many of his hollow campaign promises. Sure, it might be a stretch to blame Trump for the four amendments failing, but he certainly didn’t help their chances.

Early voting turnout numbers show Democrats voted in greater numbers. But make no mistake, many Republicans questioned the proposed constitutional changes. They, too, complained over the lack of clarity in Amendment 2 and what they saw as power grabs in the other three proposals. And with just 21% turnout overall, a considerable majority of voters said “no” by not bothering to show up at the polls.   
There were indications ahead of Saturday’s election the four amendments were doomed to fail, but state Republican leaders were either unaware or in denial. By then, early voting turnout figures provided some writing on the wall.  
That much was revealed a week ago at the White House when Landry joined Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise to announce Hyundai’s plans to build a $5.8 billion steel mill in Ascension Parish. Before Trump appeared, a “hot” microphone captured a conversation about the upcoming election among the three Louisiana leaders.
Scalise noted that a Jefferson Parish Council race was also on Saturday’s ballot, which he suggested would help turnout there.
“You’ve gotta predict most of them will be ‘yes’ votes,” Scalise said, referencing the amendments.
“Most of them ‘yes’ votes,” Landry repeats, then responds. “You know you’re doing something right when they’re spending money against you.”
Scalise is seemingly out of touch with his home parish, as its voters fell in line with statewide trends, with two-thirds of voters dismissing all four amendments. It was one of 49 parishes where “no” swept the ballot, compared with 11 where “yes” prevailed across the board. Amendment 2 gained approval in just three other parishes.
As for the governor’s take on opposition spending, it should be noted spending in favor of Amendment 2 included $292,000 from a Landry political action committee, Make Louisiana Great Again. Campaign finance records show another $157,000 came from Americans for Prosperity, $125,000 from the Louisiana Republican Legislative Delegation and $14,000 from Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier’s Foundation PAC.
All totaled, that’s $580,000 spent in support of Amendment 2, compared with $509,000 from opponents of all four proposals – hardly the “millions” the governor claimed.
So either our governor is bad at math, or he’s chosen to spread some “fake news” of his own.
Neither is a good look for Louisiana.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Minneapolis last week became the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

“Provost Mattison has been an exceptional leader and an esteemed colleague, and I’m beyond grateful for her unwavering commitment these last 10 years,” said Drake University President Marty Martin in the release. “She has tirelessly dedicated the pinnacle of her career to fulfilling Drake’s mission, and our University is better for her doing so. I wish her all the best as she begins this new chapter of her life.”
During her time at Drake, she led efforts to expand online education and diversity, equity and inclusion programming, in addition to her oversight of academic departments, office of student life and other areas of campus, the release states.
Mattison started serving as Drake’s provost in 2016, according to the release, and has held positions at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Iowa. She also attended both state universities as a student, earning her undergraduate and master’s degrees from UNI and her doctorate from the UI.
Martin said in the release her background in epidemiology, starting with her studies in Iowa, helped steer the university through the COVID-19 pandemic, which he called an “extremely challenging time.”
Mattison said it’s the people who make up the Drake community she’ll miss the most, according to the release.
“Serving as provost of Drake University has been one of the greatest privileges of my career,” Mattison said in the release. “I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have worked alongside such remarkable and talented colleagues and students.”

Josh Gottheimer's campaign said it is not behind an ad that urges Jewish Republicans to cross party lines and vote for Gottheimer in June's gubernatorial primary. (Photo by Danielle Richards for New Jersey Monitor)A new campaign ad in support of Rep. Josh Gottheimer is urging Jewish Republicans to change parties temporarily to vote for the Democrat in his party’s six-person contest for governor, saying Gottheimer is the “least not bad guy” in the race.
The ad, which appeared in the WhatsApp chat of a Jewish news site over the weekend, tells Jewish Republicans to “be a Democrat for a day” — or a “sheep in wolf’s clothing” — to cast a ballot for Gottheimer, who is Jewish. There are more than 1,000 people in the chat.
“Register as a Democrat and vote for this guy — his name is Josh Gottheimer. Just remember his name until you walk out of the poll and forget it,” the man starring in the two-minute ad says. “Just trust me, he’s the best option that we have. He’s the least not, not, not bad guy in the race.”
It’s unclear who’s behind the ad, and there’s nothing to indicate who paid for it. Gottheimer campaign spokesman Peter Opitz said the ad is not from the congressman’s campaign.
New Jersey voters can’t cross party lines in the voting booth for primary elections. If they are registered Republicans, they can only vote for Republicans. Party members have until April 16 to change their party registration in time for the June 10 gubernatorial primary.
This isn’t the only time New Jersey Republicans have been asked to switch parties to vote for a Democrat this year. Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson) sent a letter to Republicans asking them to change parties to cast ballots for the two Democratic Assembly candidates he is supporting in the 33rd District — which he represents — and then change their party affiliation back to the GOP after June’s primary.

The man who appears in the ad pushing Gottheimer’s candidacy tells viewers to “face the facts” that Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey and the Democratic gubernatorial candidate will probably win November’s election to succeed a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, himself a Democrat.
The New Jersey governor is “the guy who decides whether you have to wear a mask in the Target,” he says.
“So here is the shtick. It’s called be a Democrat for a day. Don’t freak out. Calm down, calm down,” he says. “The Hasidim have been doing this for years. Not the worst thing in the world.”

(Main photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch. Inset photo of company policy is from U.S. District Court records)Casey’s General Store is being sued for allegedly exploiting its workers through the discriminatory practice of imposing a tobacco-use surcharge for health insurance coverage.
The surcharge, which is alleged to be $35 per pay period, amounts to an illegal “cash grab” by Casey’s that is masquerading as a wellness program, the lawsuit claims.
Filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the lawsuit seeks class-action status but is currently filed on behalf of one Casey’s employee, Elizabeth Blalock of Carroll County, Missouri.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Attorneys for Blalock allege that all Casey’s workers are automatically assumed to use tobacco unless they submit to a process in which they provide a sworn affidavit stating they do not. Any worker who fails to complete that process by a specified deadline is then required to pay “tobacco surcharge” for the entire calendar year, even if they do not use tobacco, the lawsuit claims.
In addition, Casey’s allegedly fails to provide the federally required options that would allow employees to avoid the surcharge. “The surcharge is structured as a penalty rather than a legitimate wellness incentive,” the lawsuit claims, since the workers “who miss the enrollment deadline are penalized for the entire year without any opportunity to later demonstrate compliance or avoid the surcharge.”
The lawsuit is based on the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA allows employers to deduct from workers’ pay a tobacco-use surcharge, but only in connection with wellness programs that meet specific federal guidelines established in 2014. Those regulations state they are intended to ensure corporate wellness programs actually promote health as opposed to being a “subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor.”
The lawsuit alleges Casey’s is illegally shifting the costs associated with less healthy workers from the company back to those same workers “who end up subsidizing their healthier colleagues.”
ERISA bars any health insurer or medical plan from discriminating against participants by charging premiums based on a “health-related factor,” including tobacco use. It does, however, allow group health plans to establish premium discounts or rebates” in return for adherence to programs that promote wellness and disease prevention.
Casey’s, the lawsuit claims, does not meet that standard.
“There is no smoking-cessation program, waiver, or alternative route for tobacco users” to avoid the surcharge, the lawsuit alleges. “The only avenue for smokers to avoid the surcharge is to quit smoking and then submit that change in status to the benefits department. Thus, tobacco users are penalized based solely on their status as smokers, which violates ERISA’s nondiscrimination provisions.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that “allowing companies like Casey’s to exploit their participants and unlawfully extract millions from them under the guise of a wellness program that is, in reality, a cash grab, directly contradicts ERISA’s purpose of protecting workers from health-based discrimination. If unchecked, this practice would permit employers to manipulate wellness programs as revenue generating schemes rather than genuine health initiatives.”
According to the lawsuit, Blalock has forfeited to Casey’s $35 in earnings per pay period — roughly $910 per year — in order to maintain health coverage through the company.
Casey’s, which is headquartered in Ankeny, is one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, with more than 2,600 locations in 16 states. There are more than 18,000 employees enrolled in the company’s health plan, according to court records.
In seeking class-action status for their lawsuit, the plaintiff’s attorneys argue the amount of money at issue exceeds $5 million, and the number of Casey’s workers who might potentially join the case is more than 1,000.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful imposition of a discriminatory tobacco surcharge and breach of fiduciary duty. Casey’s has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The company did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment.
The plaintiff is represented by attorney Adam J. Wachal of the Koley Jessen law firm in Omaha.

Marygrace [&#8230;]","A health care worker administers the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)Several physicians and experts testified against two proposals introduced before the Health and Human Services Committee on Monday that they said would undermine public health and spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. 
One proposal, LD 871, would prevent the state from requiring healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, including emergency medical services personnel. Marygrace Cimino (R-Bridgeton) introduced the bill despite the fact that in 2024 the COVID-19 vaccine was removed from the list of immunizations the state requires healthcare workers to have, based on guidance from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, although the agency continues to recommend the vaccine.
Given the current lack of a mandate, the legislation “serves no obvious purpose,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a pediatrician in Waterville and representative of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
“The motivating force appears to be anti-vaccine sentiment,” he said. “We find it unfortunate that vaccine policy in general and COVID vaccine in particular, has devolved into a partisan issue.”
Northe Saunders, executive director for Maine Families for Vaccines, said the bill would tie the hands of future leaders and public health experts in the case of a possible new COVID variant or another surge.
“We cannot afford to ban the use of a tool that has saved millions of lives worldwide just because we’re no longer in a crisis,” he said.
Another bill presented to the committee, LD 436, sponsored by Rep. John Eder (R-Waterboro), would prevent any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. That restriction would ban health care provider networks and offices, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the MaineCare program from sharing resources with families to help make decisions about vaccination for their children.
During the public hearing, Eder’s bill was similarly critiqued by public health experts for promoting anti-vaccination rhetoric, endangering public safety and undermining trust in evidence-based healthcare. 
“This bill does not address a legitimate concern,” said Jessica Shiminski, program director of the immunization program within the Maine CDC. “Instead, it increases vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, posing a significant threat to public health. The state’s efforts to increase vaccination rates are crucial in protecting the health of children in Maine, and this bill undermines those efforts.”
Eder said he introduced the bill based on questions about the efficacy of the latest COVID-19 vaccine and the diminishing seriousness of infections in recent years. He cited the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that only 12.8% of children and 23.1% adults got the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine. Combined with the fact that children are far less likely to fall seriously ill or face severe symptoms from COVID, Eden said the Maine CDC should stop promoting the vaccine for kids.
“American adults are abstaining, but children, babies as young as six months old, rely on informed decisions made by their parents based on information they get from us,” he said. “For many parents like myself, it’s foreboding to see the vaccine recommended atop the childhood vaccine schedule.”
The COVID-19 vaccine decreases a child’s risk of hospitalization by more than 50%, according to Sewall of the American Academy of Pediatrics. While most pediatricians recommend the shot, Sewall said that when given accurate information about the low risk of serious illness in children, most parents decline. The exception is children who are immunocompromised. 
“While the public health burden from COVID has greatly decreased, it still circulates and causes disease in kids,” Sewall said. 
“Parents and clinicians should have access to the most up to date, scientifically based information making decisions regarding child health. Politics should not play a role in vaccine policy.”

State Rep. Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, pleaded guilty Friday before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal to refusing to take a breathalyzer test in exchange for prosecutors dropping a citation for failing to obey traffic control devices. 
He had pleaded not guilty to the citations during his initial appearance Feb. 19.
Sanchez, 28, must complete 10 hours of community service, undergo alcohol treatment, and use a breathalyzer-activated ignition device for six months, according to an order from Traffic Tribunal Magistrate Mark Welch.
Welch had also ordered Sanchez’s license suspended 30 days, but the ruling was retroactive to Feb. 19 — meaning it’s since been reinstated.
Sanchez still faces a misdemeanor DUI charge in Providence County Superior Court, where a pre-trial conference is scheduled for Friday, April 4. 
The second-term lawmaker deferred inquiries Monday to his attorney, former Rhode Island House Speaker John Harwood, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has reserved comment on Sanchez’s Traffic Tribunal plea as the criminal case continues. Sanchez was arrested by Cranston Police on Feb. 3 after an officer spotted him behind the wheel of a 2017 Nissan Altima stopped at a green light on Reservoir Avenue at 3 a.m. The arresting officer claimed Sanchez was disoriented and smelled of alcohol, which Sanchez has denied.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.

This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

Mike Braun on Friday announced two new agency heads for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and the Indiana Office of Technology (IOT).
A third agency — the Indiana Department of Revenue — is still waiting for permanent leadership. Kevin Gulley is DOR’s acting commissioner, according to Braun spokesperson Molly Craft.
Lyndsay Quist will lead INDOT as the second commissioner under Braun after Kent Abernathy, who held the role from Jan. 13 to March 28.
The State Personnel Department provided no reason for his resignation.
Quist will oversee the planning, building and maintenance of the state’s transportation infrastructure with a focus on quality of life enhancements, economic growth and accommodating new modes of transport, according to a release.
“As the crossroads of America, our roads and transportation are critical for driving economic growth in our state,” Braun said. “Lyndsay Quist’s experience of over a decade with INDOT as well as her experience as an engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared her well to step into this role and serve Hoosiers.”
Quist has served in multiple roles with INDOT since 2013. Before joining the agency, she worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the New Orleans District in Louisiana.
Warren Lenard was tapped to lead IOT. He will oversee information and technology efforts across Indiana state government.
“IOT works behind the scenes to keep state government afloat and operational. I am excited to announce that Warren Lenard will sere as the next Director of the Indiana Office of Technology,” Braun said. “His private sector experience brings the type of entrepreneurial mindset that our state government so desperately needs.”
Lenard most recently served as the chief operations and information officer for Byrider Auto Sales in Carmel and as the vice president of Technology and Operations for JD Sports Finish Line in Indianapolis.

It was six months ago that Hurricane Helene devastated much of western North Carolina with record-breaking rainfall and flooding. Since that time, federal, state and local officials have worked in determined — often heroic — fashion to help communities recover.
Today, however, the situation is best described as mixed. As NC Newsline learned in a conversation with Buncombe County State Representative Lindsey Prather, while much of the region is back up and running, the situation varies widely from place to place. While most roads are clear and many homes and businesses back to normal, huge needs remain, and Prather says much more is needed from state government — particularly in the way of grants — to help get the region’s economy back on its feet.

For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death. “If [&#8230;]","Older adults participate in a falls prevention awareness day of action in Fort Worth, Texas, in September.

(Photo: Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
 

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Together, the two fires burning in Greenville and Pickens counties grew to more than 13,500 acres over the weekend. By Saturday, the Table Rock wildfire in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains had become the largest, single mountain fire in state history.
Neither grew significantly between Sunday and Monday, with help from rain and increasing containment, according to a Monday update from the state Forestry Commission.
As of Monday morning, the Table Rock fire was 30% contained, and the Persimmon Ridge fire was 64% contained, according to the commission. That was a big improvement from Friday, a week after the first fire started, when both were at 0% containment.
“Yesterday’s rainfall, coupled with the strong firefighting efforts over the past several days, have allowed us to make great progress on the fires,” Mike Brod, who oversees a team of firefighters, said in a Monday morning update.
No homes had been damaged, and no injuries or deaths had been reported as of Monday, according to the commission.
People in Pickens County were allowed to return home Saturday evening as evacuations shifted from mandatory to voluntary. Greenville County residents nearest the blaze on Persimmon Ridge remained under mandatory evacuation orders.

The larger Table Rock fire, which was burning at more than 12,500 acres Monday, jumped the North Carolina border Sunday, igniting more than 500 acres over the state line in Transylvania County.
Officials planned to focus Monday on the northern and eastern edges of the Table Rock fire where the fire was smoldering. The half-inch or so of rain that fell Sunday will allow firefighters to work much closer to the flames, preventing them from spreading, Brod said.
The eastern edge of the Persimmon Ridge Fire was also a concern, since the flames had reached debris leftover from Hurricane Helene. Crews planned to break up the piles of debris to reduce fuel for the fire, Brod said.
More rain is expected Monday, with the National Weather Service predicting thunderstorms throughout the day Monday and again Wednesday.
Following the weekend rain showers, officials lifted a statewide burn ban for all but five counties.
Residents in Greenville, Horry, Oconee, Pickens and Spartanburg counties still may not set fires outdoors because resources are already stretched thin fighting fires in those areas, according to a news release.
Both fires were set by people.

Perez announced [&#8230;]","Screenshot via the Florida Channel of Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando on March 31, 2025. Insisting more Floridians are clamoring for cuts to their property taxes than sales taxes, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday attempted to hijack the proposal just announced by House Speaker Danny Perez to save Floridians nearly $5 billion in sales taxes and said that instead the Legislature should direct that cut towards property taxes.
Perez announced last week that he wanted to cut the sales tax for all Floridians this year from 6% to 5.25% — which, if passed, would save them nearly $5 billion. DeSantis dismissed the idea on Monday, though, saying that while well intentioned it would do nothing for Floridians hungering for property tax relief.
A sales tax cut isn’t the first place to go when it looks to providing relief for Floridians, he said.
“I want Canadian tourists and Brazilian tourists subsidizing the state, making it so Florida residents pay less less taxes,” DeSantis said at the Florida Realtors office in Orlando. “I don’t want to give Canadians a tax cut.”
He later doubled down, emphasizing that a sales tax wouldn’t be well directed.
“It also allows relief for foreigners. It allows for relief for visitors and part-time residents,” he said. “I think that tax relief needs to be focused on Floridians. We need a Florida First tax package.”
DeSantis has been speaking for more than a month about providing property tax relief, potentially by placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to eliminate the ability of local governments to collect property taxes.
He took the House’s proposal as evidence that chamber is up for providing billions in tax cuts, and “if that’s something that they’re willing to discuss, we’ll accept that, but we’ll come with a proposal to focus that $5 billion on reducing property taxes for people in Florida.”
He added that if the Legislature agrees to that idea, it would be the “opening salvo” in providing major property tax relief for Florida homeowners, because he still hopes the Legislature will vote to place a constitutional ballot on the 2026 ballot removing local property taxes.
State pays the difference?
Such a proposal could result in approximately $1,000 in property tax cuts for every homesteaded Floridian, the governor said. Although most property taxes go to local governments, the state could cut what is known as the Required Local Effort, which pays for schools, he continued. He suggested the state could make up that difference through its budget reserves.
“We don’t need people to pay property taxes on that specific line-item,” he said. “So we would roll that back to zero. We’d also roll back some of the local lines and issue a rebate and that’s how you end up getting to the $1,000 per resident or homesteaded property.”
The Phoenix reached out to Perez’ office for comment but did not receive an immediate response.
Senate President Ben Albritton said last week that he was “open-minded” about Perez’s proposal to cut the sales tax.
“Everybody knows right now we have an affordability challenge with many families in Florida,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “We’re reviewing what the proposal looks like and we’ll see where it goes, but, to be clear, we are supportive of lower taxes in Florida.”
Florida ranks near the middle of the states for per capita property tax revenue, according to the Florida Policy Institute. That’s not good enough, DeSantis says.
“You gotta do property relief,” he repeated towards the end of Monday’s news conference. “If you want to do sales on top of that, I’m all for that, for sure, but this property stuff needs to be addressed.”

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina six months ago was, in many communities, enormous. Few aspects of normal life escaped being upended, and one very important such area was child care.
As journalist Sara Murphy detailed in a recent report published by NC Newsline and the national news site, the Hechinger Report, six months after the storm, many young children and their families are still struggling with the disaster’s consequences. At least 55 early child care centers were damaged in the storm, and several remain shut or are operating out of a temporary location. And the ramifications for kids, parents and the region’s economy continue to take a toll.

The Wichita Republican hopes lawmakers can wrap up the session after returning to Topeka on April 10. That would be before the mid-April release of new state government revenue estimates typically relied on to fine-tune the budget. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly marked close of the Kansas Legislature’s regular session by signing a bipartisan bill forbidding applicants for about 85% of state government jobs from being rejected solely due to lack of a college degree.
Kelly, the second-term Democratic governor, said she previously implemented that standard in executive branch agencies under her jurisdiction. The House and Senate approved Senate Bill 166 to formally emphasize a person’s prior experience or specialized training when determining work readiness for state government jobs.
“I am pleased to sign this bill to codify this practice,” she said. “There are a multitude of factors that go into employment consideration, and a postsecondary degree should not always be the deciding factor.”
No more than 15% of state employees worked in positions for which a college degree was necessary. These jobs would be exempted from the new state law.

“Countless Kansans chose to build their careers rather than take on debt for a degree, and it’s time we recognize and reward their skills,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican convinced he learned more on the job than in college earning a master’s degree.


The governor signed a cluster of noncontroversial bills last week as the 2025 Legislature brought the regular session to a close Thursday with a flurry of partisan activity. These pieces of new state law require higher educational institutions to update accreditation policies regularly, allowed dependents of military personnel stationed in Kansas to enroll in school early, voided a discriminatory residential covenant inhibiting a Wichita State University project and expanded college financial aid to Kansas National Guard members and their families.
Kelly will have an opportunity to sign or veto additional bills piled on her desk before the Legislature’s scheduled return April 10. House and Senate leadership want to quickly conclude their business for 2025. The goal of GOP leaders has been to tie the hands of Kelly in terms of budget and tax policy, while avoiding a repeat of the 2024 special session devoted to passage of a monumental state income tax cut.

Matter of perspective

House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, praised the House for its dedication since the annual session began in January. He deflected questions about whether he would run for state insurance commissioner in 2026, but touted work of the 125-member House under his control.
“We have done a great job this year,” said Hawkins, referring to the first session since legislators salaries nearly doubled their salaries. “Do you realize that not once did we go past midnight. ”
Lenexa Sen. Dinah Sykes, who leads Senate Democrats, said the session was artificially shortened by GOP leadership to get the House and Senate out of Topeka before issuance of new state revenue estimates in mid-April. Normally, the Legislature would rely on that revised financial report to set final spending and tax policies before adjourning. This year, she said, Republicans insisted on flying blind and risked unnecessarily cratering the state budget.

“Republican legislative leaders condensed the schedule this year to complete work before we fully understand how the tax cuts we passed affect our budget,” Sykes said. “It’s irresponsible to make critical decisions without knowing the full consequences. In the future, we need to slow down and work together on bipartisan solutions that address real challenges in our state and benefit all Kansas families.”
In 2024, the consensus revenue group met April 17 to revise estimates made in November 2023 based on the additional six months of actual data.
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, pushed back.
“We have done a tremendous amount of work, and I believe a lot of good for the people of Kansas,” he said.
 
Veto pen at ready

The bipartisan harmony that greeted Kelly’s signing of a cluster of bills Friday clashed with the governor’s work on a pair of bills this session on election and health are reform. In both instances, the Republican-dominated House and Senate responded to Kelly’s vetoes with two-thirds majority votes to override her.
The House and Senate agreed to punt Kelly’s veto of Senate Bill 4, which ended the three-day grace period for advance mail ballots arriving late at county election offices. Kelly said the bill would disenfranchise voters. State lawmakers also derailed her veto of Senate Bill 63, which prohibited health care providers from delivering gender-affirming medical care to minors. The governor said the law ignored a Kansas value of respecting parental rights.
“As I’ve said before, it is not the job of politicians to stand between a parent and a child who needs medical care of any kind,” Kelly said.


Kelly will have additional opportunities to veto bills that range from much-debated legislation on taxes, education, elections and child support for fetuses to lower-key bills on firework sales, sex education, government secrecy, horse racing and employee background checks.
While issuance of specialty state license plates for nonprofit organizations rarely produced controversy, Senate Bill 18 would authorize a plate for Hunter Nation Inc. The organization says it was dedicated to the political or legal fight to build “a grassroots army to promote and protect the traditional American values of God, family, country and the hunting way of life.” Hunter Nation has a litigation fund to pursue its agenda, including a plan to end federal listing of the gray wolf as threatened or endangered in 48 states.
“It’s a very bad policy to use license plates to espouse political or religious causes,” said Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita.

 
The budget debate

In terms of the state government’s budget woven into Senate Bill 125, Kansas governors have the option of rejecting the entire package or making line-item vetoes of specific spending provisions. Kelly has used this power in the past to jettison earmarks inserted into the budget at the behest of special interests.
In the new state budget, Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said she was concerned millions of dollars was earmarked to purchase a firearm-detection software system that would rely on school cameras to remotely identify people with guns. At the same time, she said, the budget didn’t appropriate enough for K-12 special education programs.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the Legislature was once again spending far too much. It was wrong to have allowed state general fund spending to climb from $7 billion in 2019 to $10.8 billion in 2025, she said. She said many of her constituents weren’t beneficiaries of that largesse.
“It’s too bad those average families don’t have a lobbyist,” she said.
Sen. Rick Billinger, the Goodland Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, said the perspective of legislators inevitably ranged from those who argued state spending was outrageous or measly.
“Everybody has their outlook and they’ve got things that they want or things that they don’t want. That’s how the process works,” he said.
 

Constitutional questions
The House and Senate, with two-thirds majorities, agreed to place an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on statewide ballots in August 2026 that would undermine authority of Kansas governors to appoint members of the Kansas Supreme Court. The current merit-based approach enabled a commission led by attorneys to nominate finalists for Supreme Court vacancies to the governor, who could pick one or reject them all.
Kansas justices stand for retention elections on statewide ballots. However, the GOP-led Legislature has decided Supreme Court justices should serve six-year terms and stand for reelection just like local, state or federal government politicians. Kelly expressed reservations about the proposed change, but constitutional amendments go directly to the ballot. Governors cannot veto proposed constitutional amendments.
“Kansans can reclaim power from the elites who have controlled the Kansas Supreme Court for nearly 70 years,” said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican who has challenged Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights and school finance. “Should lawyers chosen by other lawyers decide who sits on our highest court?”
Senate Concurrent Resolution 1611 cleared the House 84-40 and was carried in the Senate by a vote of 27-13.
“This is a blatant attack by the legislators on our justices, and it’s part of a decades-long pattern of politicians attempting to punish the judicial branch for issuing decisions on education and reproductive freedom that they disagree with,” said Micah Kubic, executive director of ACLU of Kansas. “We are confident that, just as they did in 2022, the people of Kansas will see this attack for what it is and, once again, take action to defend their constitutional rights from the power grabs of extremist politicians in Topeka.”
During the 2025 session, a slew of proposed constitutional amendments fell short in the Senate and House. The roster included amendments to block public tax dollars from being spent on nonpublic K-12 schools, to allow individuals to vote at age 16, to include ammunition and firearm accessories in the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, to affirm existing law requiring voters to be U.S. citizens and to allow prosecution of businesses who hire immigrants not in the country legally.
The Senate and House split on House Concurrent Resolution 5011, which would have limited growth of valuations on residential property to no more than 4% annually. The Senate passed the measure 27-13 after the proposed ceiling was raised from 3% and implementation delayed until 2027, but it was defeated in the House on a vote of 37-88.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3190541-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 12:23:25.903136

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)COLUMBIA— Legislation advancing in the state House would ban credit card companies from tracking sales of guns or ammunition and ensure no government agency in South Carolina keeps a registry of gun owners.
Similar legislation has already been signed into law in other Republican-led states.
The bill, dubbed the “Second Amendment Financial Privacy Act,” is set for discussion Tuesday by the House Judiciary Committee. It would leave enforcement to the state attorney general. Any government or company that ignores a warning to cease and desist would face a fine of up to $1,000 per violation.
“We wanted to prevent anything that would infringe on gun owners’ rights,” the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Bobby Cox, R-Greer, told the SC Daily Gazette after a House panel unanimously advanced the bill.
The bill has the backing of the chamber’s GOP leaders. The 34 co-sponsors include House Speaker Murrell Smith and House Majority Leader Davey Hiott.
The proposal does not apply to gun ownership records kept during the “regular course of a criminal investigation and prosecution.”
Legislation similar to the South Carolina proposal started popping up around the country after the International Organization for Standardization, a Switzerland-based group that creates international business standards, approved in September 2022 the creation of unique codes — called merchant category codes — for stores that sell guns and ammunition.
Businesses are coded for all sales made with a credit or debit card, whether at a restaurant, a clothing store or the grocery. In addition to banks using the codes to track rewards programs, the coding helps with business accounting systems and tax records.
Advocates that pushed for a separate code for gun stores, led by New York-based Amalgamated Bank, argued it was a safety measure that could reduce mass killings.
The killers in mass shootings such as the July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater; the June 2016 Orlando nightclub; and the 2017 Las Vegas music festival all bought thousands of dollars’ worth of guns ahead of the massacres, according to a report by The New York Times.
Critics of the coding say law-abiding gun owners could be unfairly profiled and tracked as a result.
South Carolina’s Alan Wilson was among 24 attorneys general nationwide who signed a letter to the heads of American Express, Mastercard and Visa less than two weeks after the international group approved codes for gun stores.
“Generating a ‘list of gun buyers’ creates the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers’ information will be leaked, discovered, hacked, or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights,” read the letter dated Sept. 20, 2022.
Nineteen states have passed laws similar to South Carolina’s bill, according to the National Rifle Association. They include Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama. Legislators in North Carolina are considering a similar law.
The laws were initially preventive measures that didn’t do anything, since banks hadn’t adopted the coding.
But then California passed a law in September 2023 requiring banks and credit card companies to use the codes, followed by Colorado and New York. The codes must be assigned to gun stores in those states by May 1.
A bill that would ban the tracking nationwide was introduced last month in the U.S. House. Its 95 co-sponsors include Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina’s Second District.
“It’s a real issue that is out there,” Neil Rashley, chief attorney for the South Carolina Bankers Association, said last week. “But it’s kind of in flux.
With some states requiring the codes and others banning their use, Rashley said companies with national operations will likely have to hire extra staff to ensure they’re following the rules for each state.
The bankers’ association is not taking a position on the bill. Rashley said he’s confident banks in South Carolina are not using the gun shop codes, nor do they have any plans to do so.
“We certainly understand your concerns, and we’re not standing in opposition to it,” he said.

Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are ringing alarm bells over congressional Republicans’ proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding, which could especially hurt older Americans. (Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved. 


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Despite his 2022 campaign promise to move into the congressional district he was elected to represent, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner hasn’t moved — and now, he doesn’t plan to.
The 41-year-old Democrat first revealed his change of heart during a taping of WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers on Friday, citing family’s circumstances for why he has backed off his campaign pledge.
“We’ve decided that at this point, it makes sense for us to stay in our house in Providence,” Magaziner said. He referenced his family’s new baby, born in April 2024, and his wife’s new job that requires a two-hour commute from Providence to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moving to Cranston would likely extend that travel time.

The U.S. Constitution requires members of Congress to live in the states they represent, but not the district. Yet Magaziner pledged during his first run for congressional office in 2022 — filling the seat vacated by former Rep. Jim Langevin — that he would move into the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the state’s southern and western areas. 
At the time of the 2022 election, Magaziner and his family lived on the East Side of Providence, which falls within the 1st Congressional District. The capital city is the only state municipality bifurcated by the congressional district line. Indeed, Magaziner’s Providence home falls one mile away from the district line.
In 2023, Magaziner and his wife bought a house in the Edgewood section of Cranston. However, during his 2024 reelection campaign, Magaziner was still living and voting in Providence, outside his district, WPRI reported at the time. Magaziner told WPRI that renovations to his Cranston house were more extensive than expected, which is why he had not moved.
Now, the move is off, though the Cranston home is still listed under his wife, Julia McDowell’s name, according to city records. 
Magaziner’s office did not immediately return requests for comment Monday, including whether they plan to sell the Cranston house. However, he defended his decision on Newsmakers, insisting that where he lives has not hurt his ability to do his job or represent the 559,000 district residents.
“I continue to fight for the working people of the 2nd Congressional District with legislation in Washington, and I’ll continue to show up and deliver, just as I have for the last two and a half years,” Magaziner said during the taping.
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, chalked up the scrutiny surrounding residency requirements in Rhode Island as “more symbolic than practical.”
“We’re so geographically compact in Rhode Island,” Marion said in an interview Monday. “If this were someone in Colorado who lived in another corner of the state, it might be a problem.”
Yet, Marion acknowledged the poor optics of Magaziner not fulfilling his pledge to move. 
Rhode Island GOP Chair Joe Powers seized on the “empty promise” in a statement Friday.
“Magaziner’s decision is yet another example of how little respect career politicians have for the people of this state,” Powers said. “He told voters he was moving into the district. He made that promise. Now he’s casually breaking it with a shrug and a smile, hoping no one notices or cares.”
Powers described the situation as a pattern among Rhode Island Democrats who “say one thing to get elected, then quietly do the opposite.”
A Washington Post analysis in 2017 found 21 U.S. representatives, of both political parties, living outside of their districts. Updated information for the current Congress was not immediately available. 
“It’s not the norm but it’s not unusual,” Marion said of congressional members living outside their district.

Across the United States, gun violence continues to be an ever-more-serious national plague. According to the latest mortality data from the CDC, firearm-related deaths among children and teenagers in the United States have soared by 50% since 2019. In 2023, firearms remained the leading cause of death among American youth for the third year in a row.
So what impact is this having on the attitudes of average Americans? A new report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, entitled “Valuing the benefits of reducing firearm violence in the United States” indicates that it’s a big one and that most Americans would be willing to make significant sacrifices in order to address it. Indeed, the authors found that Americans would willing to pay nearly $100 billion for policies that reduce gun violence by 20%, and recently NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of the authors — Duke University Sanford School Professor Emeritus of Public Policy Philip J. Cook — to learn more.

Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.
I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



Last week, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

( Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill into law that sets up a new state aid fund for Kentucky communities affected by recent floods, though he has said the bill “isn’t enough.” 
House Bill 544, which received final passage in the General Assembly Friday with bipartisan support, establishes a new SAFE fund, or State Aid for Emergencies, to respond to widespread mid-February floods. The bill does not appropriate new dollars to respond to the floods. 
Kentucky previously started SAFE funds after floods in Eastern Kentucky and tornadoes in Western Kentucky.
Beshear said in a video shared on social media Sunday that he was “grateful” the legislature passed a new SAFE fund on the final day of the 2025 legislative session. The governor said the legislation “is going to help communities, cities and counties” affected by the floods, which took 24 lives. 
“After all or any of these natural disasters, the families that are impacted deserve our very best,” Beshear said. “They deserve that promise that we’re going to rebuild every structure and every life.” 
‘We’re there’: Beshear urges legislature to lift its cap on emergency spending

Under the legislation, $48 million will be transferred from the previous SAFE funds to the new one created by the bill. It also allows $100 million to be spent on flood aid from the current state budget on governor-declared emergencies, instead of the $50 million limit per fiscal year set by the legislature last year. Beshear said in February that the $50 million cap for the current fiscal year already had been reached.
When asked about the legislation before the veto period began in March, Beshear told reporters that the bill was “a little bit better from where it originally was” as it would allow funds allocated for next fiscal year to be used now. However, he said, that could be a problem for future natural disasters in Kentucky if funding is still limited. Beshear said that “while the bill isn’t nearly enough, I’ll sign it.” 
In other flood-related legislation that was filed this session, Beshear allowed a bill to become law without his signature that gives Kentucky public school districts options to make up or waive days lost to bad winter weather and floods. The Senate added protections for a controversial online school from enrollment caps imposed by state education officials. 
Additionally, the Senate passed a resolution that would have created a task force that would review how the state could become better prepared for natural disasters. However, the legislation did not move in the House.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/flood2_004-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 11:06:46.437705

For 10 years, Missouri had no incentive for production companies to film in the state. Now, more TV and film sets are coming to Missouri thanks to help from a tax credit established in 2023.


The “Show MO Act” gives up to a 42% tax credit on eligible film productions. Productions initially have the option for a 20% minimum credit but can receive up to four additional 5% credits for meeting certain conditions.


Last year alone, film productions working under the tax credit spent more than $33.5 million. The tax credit follows programs like Georgia’s long-running film tax incentive in boosting state film industries.

“That damn peach,” Missouri Film Office Director Andrea Sporcic-Klund joked, referencing the orange and green logo that appears in the credits of Georgia productions. “Hopefully you’ll be seeing our Missouri logo there pretty soon.”


Sporcic-Klund coordinates film productions in the state and promotes Missouri’s film industry through the incentive. Last year, four productions with budgets over $1 million were filmed in Missouri, which Sporcic-Klund says would not have happened without the incentive.


Film in MO, a nonprofit that works to support the tax credits, lobbied at the Missouri Capitol in February. Sporcic-Klund joined Pete Salsich, an entertainment lawyer who is on the board of directors at Film in MO, at the Capitol to promote the incentive to lawmakers.


“If you don’t have the tax credit, most of these films are simply going somewhere else,” Salsich said. “The tax credit becomes sort of your ticket into the conversation, but it’s not enough, because you can use that lots of places.”


The current tax credit is the state’s second attempt at incentivizing filmmakers to work in Missouri. The previous tax credit was repealed in 2013, with the film “Gone Girl” being the last major production in the state to receive a tax credit until the Show MO Act became official.


In the time after the tax credits expired, the state missed out on several opportunities for major film projects. The Netflix series “Ozark” was one of these productions, as the show drew much attention to the Lake of the Ozarks area despite being filmed mostly in Georgia.

“My hope is that we can get back to getting those solid productions that Missouri can be proud of,” said Sporcic-Klund. “I think losing them, like not having as big of a role in ‘Ozark,’ really changed minds.”


Renewed support for motion picture tax credits came to light in 2023, when the Show MO Act was passed. The bill was initially sponsored in the Senate by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who says he is looking forward to seeing successful results from the tax credit.


Hoskins explained that about 4,000 to 5,000 college students were graduating from Missouri universities every year with some sort of media or film degree but were going to other states for work.


“One of the points of that bill was to put the right leg forward and build up that industry so those Missourians can stay here and work in their industry,” Hoskins said.


To be eligible for the credit, each project must meet the minimum spend for the length of their script, employ certain amounts of Missouri registered apprentices and meet the criteria for a “qualified motion media project,” as outlined by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.


Film producer Cole Payne worked on his most recent project, the horror film “The Jester 2” under Missouri’s tax credit.


“As a Missourian, it’s nice to be able to stay at home and film,” Payne said.


The film, which wrapped in 2024 and is currently in post-production, was shot in various locations across Columbia, Rocheport and Boonville. On set, Payne said, everything went smoothly with the help of other Missourians.


“In the town of Rocheport, the mayor came out and supported us. The local restaurants opened up for us, made us dessert and let us use their space at night,” Payne said. “We just hired as many locals as we could.”

More than 30 other states have tax credits for filming. For people who work in Missouri’s film industry like Payne and Salsich, the credit gives them one way to show off their state.


“The out-of-town folks rave about how supportive and friendly everybody here is,” Salsich said. “When people leave here and have a good experience, they talk about it and they want to come back and do it again.”


Besides affordability and hospitality, Missouri’s geography is also appealing to producers. The state is central, which is important for transporting equipment, and, Payne said, “Missouri can be made to work for so many looks.”


The tax credit is mainly designed to bring positive marketing to the state. One of the additional credits that productions can receive is a 5% credit for filming in “rural or blighted” areas, in hopes of increasing tourism and boosting local economies.


An additional 5% credit can be awarded if a film’s script positively markets a city or region of the state, as determined by the Missouri Office of Economic Development. For some producers, this leads to a creative struggle.


Payne’s film did not receive a bonus for positive marketing of Missouri, despite spending two weeks filming in Rocheport. He disagrees with the state’s interpretation of positive marketing.


“Screenplays aren’t written to say, ‘Hey, we’re in this state, and these things are very great about this state,’” Payne said. “It doesn’t mean it can’t be a positive marketing opportunity for the state or the city that it’s filmed in.”


Other rules that were tacked onto the bill also proved to be another off-set roadblock for Payne. He says that the 100% audit required by the Office of Economic Development was a “surprise” since most audits for businesses are usually samples, which are cheaper.


Payne is currently in production for his second film in the state, which will begin filming at the end of March.


After 10 years without an incentive, Missouri has a lot of work to do to rebuild its film industry. Payne is just one producer working toward that goal.


“There’s a production industry in Missouri that’s broader than just tourism that says ‘Come live here,’ ” Salsich said. “Invest in a production house. Turn some old warehouses into sound stages. Invest in more infrastructure to enable more support to exist and attract more productions.”


Salsich says that the impact of the credit is very broad and that it is already being seen through money being spent and jobs being created through productions.


At the film office, Sporcic-Klund is optimistic about this year’s outlook for Missouri films.


“We’ve had two producers bring back second projects already, so the word is good,” she said. “We haven’t made a big push because we know that we lost a lot of infrastructure in those 10 years, so we’re building that back up.”


As the state works to rebuild the film industry, lawmakers have also taken steps to support the Show MO Act. A removal of the program’s expiration was proposed in a recent bill.


“Hopefully we don’t have to keep bringing things in, because we can start building the infrastructure and build brick-and-mortar businesses around this industry,” Payne said. “We will be able to if we can extend or remove the sunset on the bill.”


If the bill passes the House, motion picture tax credits will be ensured for the foreseeable future.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Firearms legislation in Kansas took a backseat during the 2025 legislative session to tax relief and election debates, but advocates and legislators who see room for improvement in Kansas’ gun laws are hopeful bills addressing suicide prevention and child safety will be addressed next year.

For the past three sessions, the gun violence prevention advocacy organization Moms Demand Action has supported a bill bolstering efforts to prevent children from accessing firearms. House Bill 2167 would require guns and stun guns to be locked in storage containers, and it would create a crime for failure to properly store a weapon where a child has access. Penalties would be greater for firearms with large-capacity magazines.
Shannon Little, the leader of the Kansas chapter of Moms Demand Action, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that Kansas’ firearm laws are some of the weakest in the nation.
The organization’s safe storage bill was referred to the House Federal and State Affairs Committee, where rules allow anything introduced in an odd-numbered year to be brought up again the following session. The bill would penalize someone if an improperly stored firearm is used in a shooting.
“It would incentivize gun owners to responsibly store their firearms, and would definitely put the responsibility on secure firearm storage on adults and not kids,” she said.


At least two pieces of firearms legislation arrived on the governor’s desk Friday. Both have to do with law enforcement. House Bill 2052 broadens the concealed carry limitations for off-duty officers. Senate Bill 137 allows law enforcement agencies to sell or give firearms that were confiscated through civil asset forfeiture to licensed gun dealers. The governor could sign or veto those bills, and the Legislature could try to override a veto.
Little also highlighted House Bill 2379, a proposal from Merriam Democrat Jarrod Ousley called the “voluntary do-not-sell firearms list” act. Its essence is suicide prevention, Little said.
Kansas has a higher firearm death rate than the national average, and suicides made up 67% of gun deaths in the state in 2023, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The voluntary do-not-sell act would create an avenue for people to fill out paperwork to put themselves on a list that would prevent them from purchasing firearms. That paperwork would be available through health care providers and online.
Some kinks in the bill need to be ironed out, Ousley said, but he is operating within the parameters he’s politically allowed in Kansas instead of proposing a stricter red flag law, which exists in other states. Red flag laws, or extreme risk protection orders, allow authorities to temporarily seize someone’s firearms if they pose a risk to themselves or others. The provisions in Ousley’s bill make it so that any relinquishment of a firearm is completely voluntary.
“So it’s not infringing on their Second Amendment rights, aside from the safety precautions that they want to take on themselves,” she said.
The bill exists on a spectrum of prevention efforts, Little said. Even further down on the spectrum are nonpolicy efforts, such as asking a friend or family member to keep one’s firearms, that can be just as effective, she said. The thinking behind HB 2379, Little said, is to keep politics out of safety situations.
“I think it’s easier to start at the end of the spectrum that can do a lot of good (and) that the most people can agree on and, hopefully, get something really good passed,” she said.
The bill had a hearing March 13, during which several people told personal stories about loved ones or themselves. Some remembered loved ones who died by suicide. Many had purchased a firearm days — or even minutes — before they died. Some described their mental health struggles, stating they’d like to be able to sign up for a list like the one Ousley proposed.
“Six people in that room would have signed up that day,” Ousley said.
And, he said, he knows of more.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3240087-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 11:06:46.437705

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging



The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
There’s a ‘very real chance’ of federal Medicaid expansion funding cuts, lieutenant governor says

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

The buoy, which has been periodically pulled out of the water for service and then redeployed, is designed to record and transmit weather data from a site called Seal Rocks. The information is important to oil tanker safety in Prince William Sound, but the buoy has had service outages in recent years. It has operated for only 35 days in the past year and a half, according to the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. (Photo by Nate Littlejohn/U.S. Coast Guard)Too many of the weather buoys floating in the waters off Alaska are out of service and the federal government should devote more resources to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the interest of marine safety, according to a resolution pending in the Legislature.
The measure, Senate Joint Resolution 12, calls for Congress to “take actions necessary to restore the full functionality,” of the NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center meteorological sites in Alaska, which relay real-time weather information important to mariners.
The resolution calls for the state’s three-member congressional delegation to work to secure federal funding for that NOAA program, even as the Trump administration is slashing NOAA’s workforce and operations. And it points to Alaska’s vast size, harsh weather and heavy reliance on maritime operations.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, the resolution’s sponsor, said Alaskans depend on the weather buoys and the information they provide to a degree that policymakers in the Lower 48 might not appreciate.
“These are serious life safety issues,” he said.
But the resolution is about more than buoys, Dunbar said. It is a defense of a federal agency and federal scientists currently enduring an onslaught of mass firings and budget cuts, he said.
“This is a good argument for preserving National Weather Service and NOAA funding,” Dunbar said, listing one of NOAA’s best-known divisions.
Of the 27 National Data Buoy Center meteorological/ocean stations deployed in Alaska, seven are currently out of service, according to the center.
There is particular concern about outages at a Prince William Sound site called Seal Rocks. The buoy there is supposed to be transmitting critical information about winds, wave heights and other conditions that affect the safety of oil tankers using the Trans Alaska Pipeline System terminal in Valdez.
That Seal Rocks buoy, an important source of weather data for marine-safety studies, has had intermittent outages for several years and is currently out of service.
It is at Hinchinbrook Entrance, the passageway between islands that connects Prince William Sound to the wider Gulf of Alaska. The area from Hinchinbrook Entrance to the Valdez terminal – which includes Blight Reef, site of the1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, is of special concern for tanker safety.  Under post-Exxon Valdez rules, oil tankers are escorted there by safety tugs, and shipments by loaded tankers are stopped when winds exceed 45 knots or waves are above 15 feet at Hinchinbrook Entrance.
The Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council, a marine safety watchdog created by Congress after the Exxon Valdez spill, raised concerns about the outages as early as 2018.
Those outages continue.
John Guthrie, the council’s maritime operations project manager, told lawmakers at a recent hearing that the buoy has been operating for only about 35 days during the past year and a half. That hampers the U.S. Coast Guard, he said, because it has to make decisions about tanker traffic based on less-reliable information from more distant buoys, weather forecasts or chance observations by other mariners, he said.

	While subsistence fishers, commercial fishers and others on the water depend on the real-time weather information relayed by the buoys, “the Seal Rocks buoy, in particular, is a key component of the oil spill prevention system in Prince William Sound. The risk of another oil spill increases whenever it is not working,” Guthrie said at a March 20 hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee.
Dunbar said the Seal Rocks buoy situation should be compelling.
“Here’s a concrete example where National Weather Service and NOAA funding is absolutely essential to the safety of the environment in Prince William Sound but also to the economy in the state and, frankly, the nation,” he said.
Legislative resolutions do not create laws, but they express lawmakers’ sentiments. Resolutions directed at federal agencies or at Congress, such as the pending resolution on NOAA buoys, are intended to persuade federal policymakers and influence their actions.
The sentiment expressed in SJR 12, however, conflicts with Trump administration policies concerning NOAA and its divisions.
Already, the Trump administration has fired hundreds of NOAA employees around the nation, including many in Alaska. The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its workforce. Another 1,000 NOAA employees may be fired next. The agency is among those targeted by the administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, which is led by billionaire Elon Musk.
The Trump administration’s objections to NOAA appear to be related to the agency’s work on climate change.
Project 2025, a preelection blueprint for a second Trump administration produced prior to the 2024 election by the conservative Heritage Foundation, cited that work in its conclusion that NOAA “should be broken up and downsized.”
NOAA’s divisions, including the National Weather Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity,” the Project 2025 “Mandate for Leadership” document said.
Though Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 before the November election, many of the plan’s authors have high-level positions in his administration. Those include Russell Vought, director of the Office of Budget and Management, who was Project 2025’s lead author.
Impacts to NOAA of the DOGE-imposed cuts and restrictions go beyond lost jobs and workers.
NOAA just canceled a scientific conference that has been held annually for half a century. The 2025 Global Monitoring Annual Conference would have focused on information about greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycle feedbacks and other atmospheric science subjects. The 2024 conference was the 52nd held by NOAA.
Senate Joint Resolution 12 was pending in the Senate Rules Committee as of Friday.

The following is an excerpt from the recently published “Disciples of White Jesus.” In its description, Publisher’s Weekly says, “A shifting American culture is pushing white Christian boys toward radicalization, isolation, and violence, according to this persuasive treatise.” Consider buying the book at an independent Minnesota bookstore. 
We cannot understand the problems of radicalization among young, white Christian boys in America, nor fully grapple with the challenges and troubles facing these boys, without understanding what’s happening in American schools. And without consulting that most underpaid and too-often scapegoated American professional, the public school teacher.
A teacher I’ll call Joe, 59, is just the kind of teacher that hard-core advocates of traditional masculinity might dream up as their ideal educator for young, white Christian boys and men — at least at first blush. Joe, who has been teaching for 36 years in total, and 33 years in the Minneapolis Public Schools, stands 6 foot, 5 inches tall. When it comes to physical education instruction, which he has led for 23 years at his current school building, Joe is no-nonsense and almost stern, cutting a strong, athletic and disciplined figure, a product of his Marine veteran father, who worked for decades in underground pipelines after leaving the military.

Joe spends his winter days at an upper elementary school in a relatively affluent neighborhood of Minneapolis, with a student body that’s more than 85% white; only to drive across the Mississippi River after school to St. Paul’s Central High School, where he works as an assistant basketball coach at a school that is 59% POC students, including 29% Black students, in a neighborhood where 18% of residents live in poverty. 
It’s a fitting dual existence for Joe, who describes his childhood as a life in two worlds. His dad was a member of the Red Cliff Native American tribe, and the family lived together on the reservation near Bayfield, Wisconsin, even though Joe’s mother was white. He recalls that sometimes he was bullied on both ends, about his Indigenous ancestry by the white kids, and from the Native kids, called an “apple,” suggesting that while he was “red” on the outside, he was really “white” on the inside. Joe thought maybe that was because his teacher mom encouraged her four boys to do well in school, something that wasn’t always popular on the reservation, for myriad reasons.
Teaching PE and coaching basketball enable Joe to use parts of his skill set and personality that some advocates of gender absolutism might consider contradictory. He retains much of the “tough-love,” “old-school” military mentality that his dad instilled in him. And at the same time, Joe also saw the ways in which that hard-core masculine identity led his dad to a life of physical pain and even premature death. Joe saw the strengths and limitations of a masculinity that’s only rooted in hardness and discipline. So he brings a bit of his mom’s more nurturing side to his role as an educator and coach as well. After all, Joe says the best parts of his day are often the hours he spends in physical education with a smaller group of students with disabilities and cognitive delays. These students, who are often withdrawn or quiet or uncooperative in public settings, seem to innately trust Joe, something I saw firsthand when I served as a substitute teacher in his classroom. They know the rhythms and routines of the gymnasium; it was a place they clearly felt accepted, loved, and known — something achieved by an educator rooted in discipline and athleticism but also in emotional connection, patience, and kindness.
Given his popularity among many of his students and student athletes, and his continued commitment to athleticism even into his 59th year, you might think that Joe is supremely confident and undeterred in any school setting. But he knows that washboard abs or biceps would be no match for an AR-15 in a potential school shooting situation.
“That scares me more than anything as a teacher,” Joe told me, when we discussed the potential of a school shooter coming to our shared neighborhood. “Even who I am, there is very little I can do to stop that situation. The best thing we can do is just barricade ourselves.”
Joe says he thinks about it often, imagining himself in the shoes of fellow teachers and educators who have faced active shooters in their buildings.
“They probably thought the same things I do,” he said. “Your senses are so heightened as a teacher. You’re making sure all your doors are shut. You’re following the proper procedures for code red. What do you do? What do I do? What if I’m at prep? What if it’s happening in another area of the building? Of all the things, that’s the one that scares me the most.”
I’m struck at this moment by the seriousness and vulnerability and sadness that has come over Joe’s face. This is a man who deeply loves being a teacher. By the nature of his work with disabled students — among whom boys are overrepresented — and his role as a boys’ basketball coach, Joe does tend to spend a bit more time with boys as an educator and coach, though his office is also filled with cards from former students, divided equally between boys and girls. He’s also the father of a 20-something son, whom he watched attend school in the same district where he teaches. He says the two of them will talk about those boys who seem to fall through the cracks, the ones for whom traditionally male-dominated outlets like sports or mathematics don’t seem to fit, but who also don’t find their place in outlets like music or drama. He and his son recently together discussed the fact that two of his classmates — despite their relatively privileged backgrounds — had recently died of drug overdoses. Joe talked also of watching the boys who used to run with joy and abandon around his gym classes, pelting each other with balls, turn into sullen, withdrawn, and angry teenagers. Sometimes seeing them makes him feel sad and powerless.
“When you, as a teacher, can pinpoint those students out, you try and let them figure out a way for themselves, and also serve as advocate for them and help them find a way,” Joe says. “Sometimes they just need an ear to bend. Sometimes parents will ask me about younger kids and help them find a group, or a place to fit in.”
I realize, in talking with Joe, that it’s not his height or his athleticism or his perceived traditional masculinity that makes Joe a favorite among his students, or that has enabled him to have such longevity as a PE teacher in a challenging time for public school teachers, especially in inner-city, urban school districts. For Joe, for his students: the key is trust and relationship. He has been able to carve out a unique sense of both in his role as teacher and coach in Minneapolis. But it doesn’t escape me that even in this ideal school, Joe still faces the fear and anxiety of the violence of the wider world, the ominous threat of a school shooting.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1532870985-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-03-31 10:01:27.156599

But if anyone's panicking, it's not evident. Most big issues are moving, if slowly, and the chambers appear to be talking to each other.","Trees bloom outside the Maryland State House in a 2023 file photo. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers have had 82 days to deal with the major issues of the 2025 General Assembly session and, as usual, most of the big issues are still hanging with eight days left to Sine Die, the last day of the 90-day session.
But if anyone is panicking, it’s not evident. Most of the big issues are progressing, if slowly, and the House and Senate appear to be talking to each other on the bills where they have disputes. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a wrench thrown into the works in the next week, or that an unexpected issue won’t arise. Or that they’ll be done before the last minute.
But with eight days left, here’s where some of the issues we’ve been following stand.
It’s always been the budget
Coming into the session, it was clear that the big issue would be the fiscal 2026 budget, which had an estimated $3 billion deficit.  Uncertainty at the federal level related to budget and job cuts and agency presence in Maryland complicated what would have been a challenge in most years.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders have broad agreement on a budget that must be balanced. Their plan includes more than $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in new taxes.
“What is very clear and what is the most important to note about this budget is that it is fiscally sound,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). “It invests in all of our core priorities, like public education, public safety and health care, and it raises revenues from those who can most afford it, while protecting against the inevitable uncertainties that are coming from the administration.
Democratic majority muscles spending, tax plan through preliminary vote

“It is a sound budget that I think makes the appropriate efforts to put Maryland on as solid a footing as possible, given the level of uncertainty that we have,” he said.
The state’s General Fund budget — the portion paid for through sales and income and other direct state taxes — is about $400 million smaller than the current year.
Republicans and others note that many of the so-called cuts are accounting gimmicks that include holding open positions instead of hiring and shifting costs such as teacher pensions and the costs of property tax assessments to local governments.
Democrats take pains to note that their tax increases are targeted to high earners, and it’s true that 94% of Marylanders will see either a reduction in their income taxes or no change at all. But for many, the reduction — $50-$60 annually on average — will not bring the kind of “breathing room” Moore told reporters he wants the middle class to have.
High earners — $500,000 and above — will move into two new brackets. There’s also a new surcharge on capital gains for some taxpayers.
And any tax decreases will be offset by increases in vehicle emissions testing fees, taxes on vending machine sales, a $500 million tax on data and IT services, and others. One Republican calle the plan a “net more than it is a net less for taxpayers.”
The Senate will hold a preliminary vote on the two-bill package on Monday. The debate there may look similar to more than seven hours of back-and-forth in the House last week as Republicans unsuccessfully offered more than 20 amendments.
Ferguson said he expects a final vote Tuesday. The House and Senate can then convene a conference committee to work out what the Senate president described as minor differences — including the Senate eliminating a combined corporate income tax provision — by the end of the week.
The Senate version will also likely lower a House increase of the sales tax on car sales. In its place, Ferguson said the Senate is adding a $5 fee on the sale of each individual tire. The money would go to the Transportation Trust Fund.
“There’s been a lot of chatter around vehicle miles traveled, but there are concerns around privacy … and tires actually serve as kind of an interesting proxy for vehicle miles traveled,” Ferguson said. “The more you use your car, the more tires you use. So it’s similar to the gas tax. It is a user fee.”
The vote Monday means the legislature will miss the 83rd day requirement to complete work on the budget. That will trigger a letter from Moore invoking a requirement for lawmakers to remain in Annapolis to finish the budget if it is not finalized before midnight April 7, but so far no one expects the session to go into extra innings.
An energy package comes together
Also expected on Monday is an initial Senate vote on the leadership energy package, which includes a host of provisions intended to address high electric bills  for Maryland customers, with rates expected to increase further this summer.
With utility bills rising, some sort of energy reform was also expected this session. But it was not until last week that amendments suddenly debuted, bringing pieces of several other energy bills into one large package that is expected to hit the floor today.
General Assembly energy package a mixed bag for environmental groups

The legislation includes a utility bill rebate for Maryland residential customers, which is estimated to total about $80 per household, on average. But the payment, which would come in two installments, would also depend on a household’s energy usage.
“These will be immediate relief for ratepayers, who we know are feeling it harder than ever,” Ferguson said Friday.
The bill also aims to accelerate Maryland power generation — including nuclear power and potentially natural gas — and give a boost to energy storage technology, which makes use of large batteries to store energy for later use.
“We’re going to be focused on generating more affordable, reliable and cleaner energy than we have today here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “This energy package gives Marylanders more control in the short term, in the mid-term and in the long term, to lower utility bills and address the threat of climate change at the same time.”
Environmental groups say they’re thrilled to see provisions curbing utility spending on gas pipelines, and preventing investor-owned utilities from using ratepayer dollars for private jets and trade association memberships. They’re also happy about new requirements for utilities to justify multiyear rate increases, among other provisions.
But the bill’s fast-track process for power plants gives many groups pause, with worries that the procedure will result in new natural gas-burning power plants that raise the state’s emissions, and jeopardize low-income and minority communities where power plants have previously been located.
“There are some things that concern us,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club. “Given how complicated and nuanced they are, these are risky things to do quickly.”
Blueprint reform slogs to the finish
Another issue that was expected to dominate the session was reform of the 10-year, multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, now in its third year.
Local school officials continued to say they need flexibility to implement the plan according to their counties’ unique needs and budget hawks saw the plan as ripe for savings, even though Democrats insist the plan has been budgeted for through next year.
The governor said he remains fully committed to the Blueprint, and the Moore administration proposed a number of cuts, most framed as deferrals or increases that were lower than orginally planned increases.
But those brought protests from advocates and pushback from some lawmakers, with the loudest opposition coming from the House.
The House earlier this month approved an Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act — the vehicle for the Blueprint changes — that rejected the governor’s call for a freeze in funding for community schools, those schools located in low-income neighborhoods, and a reduction in the growth of the per pupil fundng formula.
The House also stuck to the Blueprint’s schedule for increasing “collaborative time” for teachers, cutting down their in-class time to allow more time for planning, training and working on projects or with students. Critics said collaborative time will require hiring 12,000 more teachers at a time of teacher shortages, and the administration plan would have delayed its implementation.
The Senate this week will take up its own version, which roughly splits the difference between the House and the governor, accepting the delay in collaborative time for teachers, but siding with the House on the need for community school funding, among other changes.
The bill should go to the House later this week, which is expected to reject it, setting up a potentially contentious conference committee before next Monday.
Housing for Jobs Act lags
One of the governor’s priorities is running behind schedule compared to most other bills this session.
House Bill 503, dubbed the Housing for Jobs Act, was voted out of its first committee in the original chamber just Friday, meaning it still needs approval from the full House before it begins the process over in the Senate. There is a Senate version of the bill, but lawmakers there are letting the House steer the progress of the bill.

Lawmakers will have to scramble if they want to get it over the finish line before Sine Die.
The legislation got a late start in committee, with the first hearings not held until early thing month. Once it was introduced, county officials found many “significant” issues, including its goal of requiring counties to automatically approve new housing developments in areas with high job growth, unless officials could cite a specific reason to reject the project.
In the time since, lawmakers, county officials and the administration began working on amendments to address the raised concerns.
It took weeks to settle on the new bill language, but the House Environment and Transportation committee essentially rewrote the bill to instead create a commission that would recommend solutions to improve the state’s 96,000 housing unit shortage, among other changes.
The new language has been described as “simpler” and more streamlined, which could have a better shot of jumping through the remaining legislative hurdles in the condensed timeframe — but it’s not guaranteed that the governor’s bill can beat the clock.
New funds for abortion grant
Legislation to tap into some $25 million in insurance surcharges is on the verge of full passage, as both the House and Senate versions of the bill are waiting on final approval in the opposite chamber.
House Bill 930, awaiting a final vote from the Senate, would allow the Department of Health to use money that has been collecting dust for around 15 years. The Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect a $1 premium per person per month that can only be used for abortion services.
Supporters of the legislation say over the course of 15 years, the fund has accumulated some $25 million, which could be used to provide abortion coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals. HB930 would create a grant fund with those dollars to do so.
Senate Bill 848 is in the same situation on the House side, meaning if either chamber votes on the legislation this week, it will go to the governor’s desk for consideration.
Chrometastically yours, almost.
Maryland is this close to expanding its roster of state symbols.
  Lobbyist Ashlie Bagwell (left) speaks to her client David Shore before a hearing on a bill to add the mineral chromite to a list of official state symbols. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A House bill to make chromite the official mineral of Maryland needs only a final vote in the Senate to secure its spot among symbols that include a state cat and dog, dinosaur, butterfly, cake and crustacean.
An identical Senate bill is scheduled for an April 1 hearing in a House Committee.
Since both bills flew out of their chambers of origin unaltered, there’s a good chance that David Shore, who eight years ago began his quest to have the mineral named as a state symbol, will see his efforts realized.
Chromite was first discovered in the Bare Hills area of Baltimore County. It quickly became an additive in paints and the making of steel alloys. It was shipped all over the world from Baltimore.
In a year of difficult debates on budgets, taxes and other serious issues, Shore’s “chrometastic” legislation might be the feel-good bill of the 2025 session.
And it’s fiscally responsible. Legislative analysts say approving the bill does not affect businesses or local government and “does not materially affect state finances.”
And no one is proposing a tax on it — as far as we know.
Reconsidering the Child Victims Act
Lawmakers will also attempt to pass legislation that will limit the state’s financial risks stemming from lawsuits filed by people claiming they were sexually assaulted while in state facilities.

It took a decade for the state to pass the Child Victims Act, a law that made it easier for child sex abuse victims to file claims against public and private institutions.
But the changes have exposed the state to potentially billions in claims. Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), the sponsor of the 2023 law and the current bill to limit state liability, said failing to act this year could bankrupt the state.
Wilson and his colleagues will attempt to make substantive changes to the law in just eight days.
The bill remains in a House committee. It must pass out of committee and get through the full House before it can begin again in the Senate.
And if it manages to get through the General Assembly and be signed into law, Wilson acknowledged it will likely face court challenges. Opponents of Wilson’s efforts say the proposed changes are unconstitutional and insulting to survivors of institutionalized sexual abuse.
Another peek at Second Look
Criminal justice advocates will be focused this week on the Senate, after that chamber’s Judicial Proceedings Committee advanced the House measure known as the Second Look Act by an 8-3 vote Friday.
The bill by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) would let incarcerated individuals who serve at least 20 years in prison petition a judge to have their sentences reduced. The measure has sparked robust debate in both chambers, which is expected to continue on the Senate floor.
“Philosophically, some of us are just probably at different ends of the spectrum when we’re talking about dealing with someone who’s in this position,” Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored the Senate version that didn’t advance out of the committee, said Friday.
The Senate advanced a similar measure last year, but it stalled in the House. This year, the House approved the bill first that included a more than two-hour, emotional debate during a rare Saturday session March 15.
The Legislative Black Caucus has labeled the bill a priority.
Reparations moving along
Another caucus priority was discussed Friday by the House Health and Government Operations Committee, which voted to advance a Senate bill to create a Maryland Reparations Committee.
Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), seeks to create a Maryland Reparations Commission to study the inequality African descendants faced in the state. A House version sponsored by Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County) didn’t advance from that committee.
The bill would focus on “individuals impacted by historical inequality,” which means those whose ancestors were enslaved in the state or “impacted by inequitable government policies.”
The specific policies would be from the federal, state or local between 1877 to 1965, informally known as the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. The bills say those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.” The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies.
Reparations could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs. The commission would be tasked with submitting a preliminary report by Jan. 1, 2027, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.
Friday’s vote fell along party lines, with the six committee Republicans voting the bill, after more than 90 minutes of debate. Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the committee, stressed the need for a “calm, respectful” discussion.
Del. Teresa E. Riley (R-Cecil and Harford) said the bill would “pick winners and losers.”
“It’s going to be extremely difficult who would be eligible,” she said. “I think ultimately if we do come up with something that’s substantial, it will bankrupt the state of Maryland.”
Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), called the measure “political” and offered an amendment to have a report done by Sept. 1, 2026, in time for next year’s elections. But Peña-Melnyk said more time is needed, not just for the report, but to appoint the nearly two dozen members to the commission.
“This cannot be done in a year,” she said. “This would take so much time, and you want to do it right.”
Del. Kim Ross (D-Baltimore County) said the bill doesn’t create a racial divide.
“On a practical level, reparations helps level the playing field,” she said. “I would feel more pride in my state with a commission this like in place. I would feel good about living here.”
Other matters

SB357: Expands the authority of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board’s efforts to reduce the cost of certain prescription drugs. The Senate version of the bill received some amendments in the Health and Government operations Friday, meaning the Senate will have to review the changes if the House approves it before it can go to the governor’s desk.
HB39: Repeals a penalty for intentional transfer of human immunodeficiency virus. The bill just needs approval from the full Senate before it goes to the governor for consideration, while the Senate version of the bill is awaiting a committee vote in the House.
SB414: creates a one-time $1,000 tax credit for parents who had a stillborn child. With no House version, the legislation is awaiting approval from the House Ways and Means Committee, which held a hearing last week, before it can move forward.
HB102: delays the implantation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program by 18-months. The House approved the bill 95-34 Friday, but it still needs Senate approval. The Senate has not moved its version of the bill out of the Finance Committee.
SB 181/HB 1123: Both measures focus on medical and geriatric parole and have been approved by their respective chambers.

Minnesota is at a critical moment. The state’s commitment to supporting people with disabilities is at a crossroads. 
Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. 
This threatens to undo years of progress.  
These cuts — from an 11% adjustment increase in 2026 to just 4% — are not mere numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent a threat to the quality and accessibility of disability services across Minnesota and serve as a blow to an already reeling workforce that provides these life-saving services. The impacts of these budget targets may be greater than the governor is anticipating. 
Of chief importance are the impacts these cuts will have on the workforce that underpins disability services. These professionals, who are primarily women and people of color, are paid low wages as it stands, especially as inflation impacts every Minnesotan’s purchasing power. Reducing the inflationary adjustment to 4% every two years ensures their pay will fall further behind increasing costs. As a result, this field’s vacant positions will become increasingly uncompetitive to new workers and existing workers will leave in search of better pay. 
We frequently hear from direct care workers: “I love this work, but I can’t afford to keep doing it.” Now, under the governor’s proposed budget, that refrain will only grow louder. Low pay and rising costs will drive workers away, increasing turnover and further straining already limited resources. 
While we hear the governor’s optimism that these budgetary adjustments will not impede the quality of care, or the number of people served, in no other industry could one expect such a large cut to not affect the work. To ask an industry that already stretches its resources to its limits to absorb this cut will result in serious consequences for those receiving care.
The ripple effects of these cuts will not stop with workers. Those receiving services and their families will bear the brunt of this proposal. Strained support networks created from these cuts will leave families with fewer resources to care for their loved ones, forcing them to shoulder an even greater responsibility. Potential facility closures will mean that those receiving care may not have the opportunity to live near their loved ones, to live in the place they desire, or to receive the care that best meets their needs.  
The governor and the Legislature must grapple with challenging questions this session about how to meet Minnesota’s needs within the realities of the state’s budget. It’s imperative these decisions prioritize the dignity and well-being of Minnesota’s many people who live with a disability and the workers who support them.
My final message is this: Legislators, I encourage you to see the faces behind the numbers. Disability services are people in our community, friends, and family members. I know you care deeply about equity and progress. I know you see an indispensable workforce for what it is. These values are at stake in this budget cycle, and we need you to balance it with the same compassion that we have come to expect from Minnesota. 
We are a state that has long prided itself on being a leader in giving everyone a fair shot at living a fulfilled life. It’s time for us to invest in those values. 
A reevaluation is needed, one with the outstanding legal and moral obligations to care for people living with disabilities.

MDH losing $226 million in federal funds
The Minnesota Department of Health announced last week that the Trump administration is unilaterally rescinding $226 million in federal grants related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts,” Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “This action was sudden and unexpected.”
The cuts amount to about 25% of MDH’s current budget, according to KARE-11, and are likely to result in the layoffs of around 200 employees. The actions are part of a broader nationwide effort to eliminate $11 billion in spending by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Among the programs affected: COVID-19 testing and vaccination efforts; research to improve vaccine effectiveness and respond to future pandemics; and efforts to develop treatments for other types of virus with pandemic potential.
Minnesota recently scored poorly on a national ranking of health emergency preparedness.
Minnesota’s most (and least) diverse counties
Minnesota has become ever so slightly more diverse since 2020, according to Census data analyzed by the USA Facts team. But it’s close to the bottom tier of states on diversity.
If you were to select two Minnesota residents at random, there’s roughly a 40% chance that they won’t have the same race and ethnicity. The most diverse state is Hawaii, where there’s a 76% chance you’ll get two people of different races, while the least diverse state is Maine, where the odds of selecting different races is just 16%.
There’s lots of variation at the county level, too. Morrison County in central Minnesota is the least diverse in the state, with less than a 9% chance of drawing two people of differing ethnicities. You might expect urban core counties like Hennepin or Ramsey to have the most diversity but that’s not quite right: Mahnomen County in the northwest scores highest on the measure, with a 62% chance of selecting people with different ethnicities. That likely owes to the county’s high proportion of Indigenous residents.
Hennepin and Ramsey aren’t far behind, however.
Nationwide, the least diverse places are counties in Appalachia, while the most diverse tend to be located in Hawaii and Alaska.
Feds may only be able to recover $50 million from Feeding Our Future defendants
Federal prosecutors have seized about $75 million in assets from Feeding Our Future defendants so far, according to the Star Tribune. That’s just a fraction of the estimated $250 million in total diversions of money by the alleged fraudsters.
And the final tally of recovered funds is likely to be even smaller, as some of the seized assets are depreciating in value and will cost money to sell off. The final recovery might be as little as $50 million, prosecutors say.
Defendants funneled their ill-gotten gains into things like lavish trips, shopping and entertainment, prosecutors allege. Some money was squirreled away overseas.
In federal white collar crime cases, recovery rates of as little as 10% are often seen as commendable, giving the difficulties of clawing back money that may have been spent over many years.
The effect of NIH cuts in your county
A consortium of researchers at several universities have released county-level estimates of the total financial impact of cuts to National Institutes of Health grants announced by the Trump administration last month.
The estimates incorporate not just the lost grant dollars themselves, but also the spillover effects of the additional economic activity the NIH grants stimulate. Running the numbers that way shows that the cuts have impacts not just in the counties where the affected medical and scientific institutions are located, but also in surrounding communities that benefit from the economic activity generated by those research hubs.
No county in Minnesota is unaffected, according to the researchers’ estimates. Minnesota as a whole will see a $355 million decrease in economic activity, causing the loss of more than 1,400 jobs.
Hennepin and Olmsted counties, home to the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic respectively, account for more than $200 million of Minnesota’s losses.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1229249-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

But one state lawmaker believes there exists another untapped market: corporate litigation.
Delaware and its centuries-old Court of Chancery is the undisputed leader of business incorporation and corporate law in the United States. Delaware proudly boasts that 67% of Fortune 500 companies and 80% of the companies filing initial public offerings in 2023 were incorporated there.
Nevada movers and shakers have long toyed with the idea of the Silver State jumping in on that corporate action. A bubbling of recent corporate dissatisfaction with Delaware has rekindled interest and created a new window of opportunity.
Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia is sponsoring Assembly Joint Resolution 8, which proposes amending the Nevada State Constitution to establish a dedicated business court.
“This will allow Nevada to compete more capably for the multibillion dollar corporate filings market by offering businesses greater legal predictability and efficiency,” Dalia told lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which heard his resolution in early March.
Nevada over the past two decades has taken steps to make itself a more enticing option for incorporation.
“However, despite the progress we’ve made, and despite having some very talented judges on the bench right now, our system still suffers from certain structural limitations that put us at a disadvantage relative to Delaware,” he said.
AJR8, if passed in the current legislative session, would have to pass again in the 2027 legislative session. Then it would go to voters in the 2028 general election for final approval. The particulars of the business court would then have to be established by the Legislature, presumably during its 2029 session.
Once established, the court would handle complex business matters, such as disputes over shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, and fiduciary duties.
Courts dedicated to specific areas of law are not unusual. In Nevada, family court is its own division and judges do not hear civil or criminal cases. Courts in Clark and Washoe counties have operated dedicated business dockets since 2001, with the goal being to adjudicate those cases more quickly.
UNLV Boyd School of Law professor Benjamin Edwards worked on the resolution with Dalia. He explains a dedicated business court using a metaphor of a busy roadway or highway.
“This is basic infrastructure that creates a lane attractive for trailers so they are not next to your Corolla,” he said.
But the financial benefit would come when more businesses choose to incorporate in Nevada and pay the state’s filing fees.
Delaware, a state with a population of 1 million people and 2.2 million businesses, generates $2 billion a year in revenue from commercial business filings. That revenue makes up 29% of their state’s general fund. (On top of that, additional taxes, and economic activity, are generated by the lawyers and their staff doing increased business in the state.)
By contrast, in Nevada, business licensing generated approximately $200 million last fiscal year, according to a report from the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office, whose commercial recordings division oversees them.
Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, who supports AJR8, says if Nevada could siphon just 5% market share off Delaware, that could mean an additional $100 million in revenue that could help “solve some of our problems — education, health care, a lot of things.”
Edwards doesn’t think Nevada will cause a “DExit” —  a silly term being thrown about that plays off the UK’s Brexit — but instead will influence new companies. Even the initial approval of AJR8 sends a signal to the business community, he added.
“I don’t think Delaware will stop growing anytime soon,” said Edwards, but if their growth slows while Nevada’s business community grows that impact will “compound rapidly” and translate into additional revenue for the state.
Other supporters of the prospect of a Nevada business court agree.
“This is the type of economic development that is very cheap for the state,” said Bryan Wachter of the Retail Association of Nevada, which testified in support of the resolution. “You are going to consider a multitude of ways of approaching economic development. Some of those are going to come with a very heavy price tag. This one does not.”
 Dissatisfaction in Delaware

“Everybody who really understands (AJR8) supports it,” said Edwards. “If you talk to business lawyers or people who are familiar with it, they get it immediately.”
But for everyone else, including the lawmakers who’d have to approve it twice and voters who’d have to approve it once, the issue may come across as Nevada kowtowing to corporate overlords who are throwing a fit because Delaware was mean to them.
“Anybody who tells you they know the right balance between protecting investors and management in corporate law is an idiot,” opined Edwards. “Nobody has a clear sense of the perfect ratio.”
Nevada and Delaware simply “strike different balances,” he added.
Enter the 1,000-lbs elephant in the courtroom: Elon Musk, the controversial billionaire who in addition to being CEO of Tesla and other companies is currently running amok as the head of the Trump administration’s slash and burn Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk has been one of the loudest critics of Delaware’s Court of Chancery and has transferred the incorporation of three of his companies to other states. In early February, he posted on his social media platform: “Texas and Nevada are the best choices for incorporation.”
Texas became the state of incorporation for Tesla and SpaceX last year. Nevada became the state of incorporation for X Corp (formerly Twitter) in 2023.
“He’s someone who has brought a lot of attention to the issue,” acknowledged Edwards, but he believes it’s shortsighted for Nevada lawmakers to see the business court proposal as being associated with Musk. “It has nothing to do with him really.”
Aguilar, when asked about Musk being outspoken on the issue, all but changed the subject, and said there are a lot of good corporate actors: “You don’t hear about them” in the contest of business litigation venue attractiveness “because they are driving their businesses forward, and they want a fair environment.”
Businesses have broader issues — primarily how easy it is to file litigation against corporations in Delaware — that are long-standing but largely uninteresting to people outside of the insular corporate law world.
“Every maybe 30 years or so there will be something that happens in Delaware that leads to a lot of people freaking out about something,” said Edwards.
Indeed, proponents in the late 1990s and early aughts pitched the establishment of dedicated business dockets in Nevada as having the potential to be a siren song for businesses contemplating a state other than Delaware.
Musk and the corporate law world’s current flavor spike centers on controlled companies — companies where one person owns more than 50% of stock. Delaware law is currently seen as being friendlier to shareholders than controllers, and has ruled that some companies for some purposes can be considered controlled even if technically 50% of the stock isn’t held by one person.
That includes Tesla and a massive $50 billion shareholder-approved CEO compensation package for Musk, which the Delaware Chancery Court rejected. (The CEO package case is being appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.)
Delaware lawmakers last week passed legislation to make it more difficult for small investors to challenge decisions made by controllers or powerful shareholders. Opponents called it “a billionaire’s bill.”
Nevada, while it does not have nearly as extensive a corporate law history as Delaware, does have an established statutory environment, according to Edwards, and is already seen as a business friendly state for incorporating.
TripAdvisor, which is moving its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, has acknowledged in filings the legal appeal in Nevada. Specifically, company leadership says it has more protections from legal liability in Nevada than it does in Delaware.
Aguilar as secretary of state, with assistance from Edwards, filed an amicus brief in the TripAdvisor case.
Aguilar says lawyers in that case were attempting to paint Nevada as the “wild wild west” where laws can’t be trusted and aren’t sophisticated enough. Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer publicly said companies that relocate to Nevada are “rolling the dice.”
“It’s not the wild wild west,” Aguilar told the Current. “There is accountability. There are measures to do what is best for shareholders.”
For large corporations, especially publicly traded ones, where to incorporate is a highly complicated decision made in consultation with an army of attorneys, Aguilar continued.
“All the law firms are aware of Nevada. Those movements (like TripAdvisor) are starting to come because attorneys are saying Nevada is sophisticated and does a good job.”
Other companies reportedly considering leaving Delaware include Dropbox and Meta, the parent company of Facebook.
Dalia, a freshman assemblymember, is employed by Meta as lead privacy and product counsel. He told the Current his work “generally centers on enforcement against bad actors using Meta products and Federal Trade Commission compliance” and is “completely unrelated” to the resolution he is sponsoring.
“AJR8 comes out of my earlier legal career advising investors and startups in Silicon Valley, where I saw first-hand how Delaware profited massively from its Court of Chancery,” he added.
That sentiment has been echoed by other supporters of the resolution.
Jeff Saling, co-founder of the nonprofit business incubator StartUpNV and venture capital fund Sierra Angels, jokingly told lawmakers during support testimony of AJR8’s hearing that he is “part of the problem.”
“When founders come to me to ask where to incorporate, I have to say Delaware,” he said. “Whether or not they’ll be able to get funding depends on whether they have a Delaware C corp.”
 Nevada Court of Chancery?

What exactly the dedicated business court greenlit by AJR8 would look like would be decided in a future legislative session, presumably in 2029, the session after voter approval.
Lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, noting that Nevada’s existing court system is already strained, raised questions about how a dedicated business court would be funded.
Edwards told lawmakers he believes the additional costs of running a business court would be offset by court filing fees and additional revenue from business recordings, but that the Legislature would ultimately have to decide its structure.
Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch pointed out there are incarcerated people who have been waiting “for years and years” in the court system.
“Can you explain why we are jumping business ahead of our constituents’ needs?” she asked.
Edwards and Dalia argued that a dedicated business court could free up the non-business judges to more expeditiously handle civil and criminal cases, benefitting the judicial system overall. They also expressed their support of additional resources for other aspects of the court system.
Edwards said a large public corporation could close a deal in Delaware in 90 days, but in Nevada could be on hold for years because the average adjudication time for business cases is currently around 1,200 days.
“That’s a real barrier in terms of selecting Nevada,” he added.
Another potential hangup is that AJR8 proposes business court judges be appointed for 6-year terms by the governor from a list of three nominees vetted by a special nominating commission. That’s different from Nevada’s current status quo of electing all judges.
Dalia said that elected benches offer no guarantee that the judge will be an expert or even familiar with business law, creating an efficiency that would be seen unfavorably by businesses and result in longer timelines for cases. He added that, unlike criminal and civil law, business law is not part of the standard curriculum at law school.
In Delaware, judges are appointed for 12-year terms and there is a rigorous process to ensure competence and expertise, said Edwards.
Texas, which is also making a push to establish a business court, is contemplating judges appointed to 2-year terms by the governor. Edwards told the Current that structure could be problematic, especially if Texas were to ever become a swing state as people have long predicted.
“If you’re sued in Texas and politically connected and you don’t like the judge, you can just stall and wait until a new governor can appoint a new judge,” he added.
AJR8’s proposal is more like Delaware than Texas. Edward believes it would be more stable because the special nominating commission would be a mix of lawmakers (the assembly speaker and senate majority leader) and judicial officials (the chief justice of the state supreme court and chief judges of the state’s three most populous district courts).
The Assembly Judiciary Committee took no action on the resolution during its March 3 hearing. On March 25, AJR8 was withdrawn from the committee and placed on the Chief Clerk’s desk. That is typically not a positive sign for a bill or resolution. But proponents are still making the case for why Nevada should try.
“We’re in a period where there’s a lot of discussion around this shift” in corporate law, said Edwards. “It’s my view that Nevada should do things that make sense. You can create infrastructure that will pay for itself and also make things more efficient and draw in more revenue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/court-money-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
 










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute




Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches.
Republican lawmakers behind the measure have said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes are unnecessary and harmful. They’ve linked them to behavioral issues in children.
“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ mission,” Morrisey said March 25. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.”
Several states are considering similar legislation, and West Virginia is the first state to pass a sweeping synthetic food dye ban from grocery stores and school cafeterias.
House Bill 2354 bans the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug 1. That will take effect much sooner than the federal ban on Red No. 3 and California’s ban of the other dyes.
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
“This extended deadline allows companies ample time to adjust, protecting consumers from price increases,” a news release from the governor’s office said.
The state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said. 
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, maintained that the food industry was using “scare tactics” to fight the bill.
“While there are many steps to take to improve our health outcomes, this bill starts by not allowing manufacturers to choose ‘poison for profit’ in our food supply,” he said. “I applaud the governor for signing the food dye bill into law. The governor believes in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement as I do and we are taking steps to improve the quality of health in West Virginia.”
Last September, California became the first state in the nation to ban food dyes from school meals, snacks and drinks. Titled the California School Food Safety Act, the law takes effect Dec. 31, 2027.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has told food executives that removing artificial food dyes is an urgent priority.
In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that Red No. 3 would be banned from food starting January 2027 and from drugs in January 2028. The Jan. 15 order came one week before President Donald Trump’s inauguration and two weeks before Kennedy’s confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate. The questioning included dyes and their use in U.S. foods.
“Thank you to the Legislature, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the entire Trump Administration for helping us launch this movement right here in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Democrats have introduced a bill to make an income tax exemption on overtime pay permanent. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Democrats in the Alabama House of Representatives have introduced a bill to preserve an income tax exemption on overtime pay that Republicans plan to jettison to pay for a tax cut package that includes a grocery tax reduction.
HB 467, sponsored by House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, would remove a June expiration date from the tax break, approved in 2023, and create a commission to study its economic impact.
“These are hardworking Alabamians that are putting into our economy,” Daniels said at a press conference last week. “These are not handouts. These are dollars that they are earning.”
When approved, the tax break was estimated to cost the Education Trust Fund budget $34 million. But the Alabama Department of Revenue says that the exemption has reduced revenue to the ETF by about $230 million.
Republicans, who hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, have signaled since late last year that they planned to let the exemption lapse. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, told media in December that the impact to the ETF could be almost $350 million before the exemption is set to expire.
House Republicans last week approved four bills that would cut taxes by $191 million.
The bills include legislation to increase the tax exemption for retirement income and increase the income tax thresholds, along with deductions and child tax credits for households who earn less than $120,000 annually.
Another bill would reduce the state grocery tax from 3% to 2% while also allowing but not requiring cities and counties to reduce their local grocery taxes.
Garrett told his colleagues in the House that reducing taxes on groceries is possible only if the tax break on overtime wages is discontinued.
All the tax breaks that legislators are considering reduce revenues to the ETF. Daniels said letting the overtime tax exemption expire would be a burden.
“We are increasing the taxes of hardworking Alabamians by about $230 million,” he said.
Daniels’ bill retains most of the language regarding the overtime tax exemption that is currently in state statute. The most significant change removes the section in the code that set time limits for the tax break, which was from October 2024 to June this year.
The legislation to exempt wages earned while working overtime was filed as the Republican budget chairs balked at how much the tax break has revenues directed toward the Educational Trust Fund budget.
More than a dozen other House Democrats have signed onto the bill as cosponsors, and Daniels said his proposal has received bipartisan support, including the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank that focuses on issues within the state.
The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.,, has publicly opposed Daniels’ proposal, arguing that it could benefit highly paid professionals and encourage employers to shift employees to hourly work without paying additional compensation.
According to a blog post, an employer could shift a person earning $50,000 and working 60 hours a week. The employer could offer $13.75 per hour to the same employee and have them work overtime. That would earn the worker an additional $4,000 after taxes without the employer having to pay the worker additional compensation.
“It creates a tax loophole that is ripe for abuse and, even if it could lead to some workers taking home higher after tax income when they work overtime, it does nothing to stop overwork of employees and it just lets employers off the hook when they are asking workers to work excessive hours,” said David Cooper, director of state policy and research at the EPI.
The exemption could also benefit highly paid hourly wage workers, white collar hourly employees such as attorneys or physicians. An example in the post considers a hypothetical CEO who earns a $4,000 hourly wage who then works more than the standard 40 hours, who would then earn even more because of the overtime tax exemption.
But the magnitude of that issue in Alabama is unclear.
“Unfortunately, the information is not reported to the Department by the income range of the person,” wrote Kirk Fulford, deputy director of the Legislative Services Agency Fiscal Division in an emailed statement. “We have no way of knowing that.”
Despite that, Daniels and other Democrats urge their colleagues to consider the overtime tax exemption to the list of proposals.
“It is giving hardworking Alabamians an opportunity to take more of their money home,” Daniels said. “But the dollars that this is returning, that is returning to our economy, is more than paying for itself.”

If you let Alabama voters decide [&#8230;]","Then-Former President Donald Trump speaks at a fundraiser for the Alabama Republican Party on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023 in Montgomery, Alabama. Republicans in Alabama's congressional delegation have embraced or been silent on Trump's tariffs on cars and agricultural products, which could have major effects on the state economy. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)By middle school, we’re all taught that the word “democracy” combines “demos,” the Greek word for people, with “kratos,” meaning rule.
Rule of the people.
That doesn’t describe the government we live under.
Alabamians say they want Medicaid expansion. They don’t seem keen on the state’s effective abortion ban. If you let Alabama voters decide whether the state should have a lottery, odds are that it would pass, and it wouldn’t be close.
None of those initiatives will pass the Legislature anytime soon. State government rests on gerrymandered districts that give party extremists a loud voice in elections. It’s also highly centralized, with state lawmakers handling issues that in other states would be city or county matters. It doubles the influence of special interests. Lawmakers fear the judgment of lobbyists more than the verdicts of voters.
Now look over to the federal side.
It seems reasonable to think that most Alabamians don’t want to make food, clothing or other goods more expensive, as President Donald Trump is doing with his tariffs. Especially when raising the price of imports from Mexico will jack up costs for the state’s automotive industry, a large employer our state leaders allegedly revere (though they seem to despise auto workers getting fresh about pay and overtime).
Or look at farmers. Prices for corn and soybeans, among Alabama’s leading agricultural products, fell 10% after Trump announced his tariffs. And is there a constituency for wiping out healthy food choices for school children?
Then there are the dedicated public servants getting thrown out of work for capricious reasons.
How are our federal representatives handling all this?
Democratic Reps. Terri Sewell and Shomari Figures have gone on record opposing the tariffs. But what about the Republicans who make up 78% of Alabama’s congressional voice?
Rep. Barry Moore likes imports. Specifically, making it easier to import firearms into a state suffering from nation-leading rates of gun violence. But he’s also said he supports tariffs on cars, claiming they will bring jobs back. Which is not how the industry sees this playing out. (Hyundai announced $21 billion in auto manufacturing projects to let Trump think it was a response to his tariffs. In fact, most of that reflects investments made before the trade announcements.)
Rep. Robert Aderholt also supports tariffs. He cheered them as protecting steel and aluminum manufacturing. There were fewer than 1,300 steelworkers in Alabama in 2022. There were nearly 59,000 people working retail sales, who are about to find their jobs a lot more difficult.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville calls Trump, who can’t commit to a single tariff approach, a “master negotiator” and claims tariffs will only bring “a little bit of pain.” Something — he didn’t say what — would be “much much worse” without them.
Sen. Katie Britt calls tariffs a “bargaining chip” with other countries. And if Trump throws Alabama jobs into the pot, she appears to be OK with that.
Rep. Dale Strong is too busy venting about something he heard on NPR to defend the 28,000 men and women in his district at risk of losing their jobs under this administration.
U.S. Reps. Mike Rogers of Saks and Gary Palmer of Hoover haven’t said anything, as far as I can tell. It’s a far cry from 2015, when they were screaming about government overreach after President Barack Obama proposed a plan to cut carbon emissions and let the states figure out how to get there.
In short, our congressional delegation is full of cheerleaders shaking the pom-poms for Team Red as their quarterback leaves the field to set the stands on fire. With you in them.
Alabama leaders neither listen to nor fear the voice of the people. The state has a long history of sending Babbitts and backbenchers to Congress, people less interested in showing leadership than collecting the perks of office and doing what they’re told.
That’s perfect for Trump. Most of our representatives seem happy to be limbs of the president. If that means kicking the state they represent — well, look, that’s what they were told to do. Don’t expect an appendage to talk back.
These tariffs threaten the state economy. And our congressional delegation, for the most part, is vigorously applauding.
That’s not democracy.  We need another Greek word to describe this.
Deilos, according to this biblical website, means “cowardly, timid, or fearful.”
A deilocracy. Rule by cowards.
A system that limits voters’ practical choices means that Alabama politics produce sycophants, not leaders. We get officials who don’t fear voters. And representatives who tell you that losing your job and paying more for groceries is worth it because Trump’s will is all that matters.
It would be nice to see more backbone. More advocacy for the people of the state.
But that’s not the system we live in. That’s democracy.
Deilocracy means we have leaders content to turn Alabama into the president’s doormat.

The Alabama Senate approved SB 200 on March 18. The House approved HB 360 on March 19. Both bills have moved to the opposite chambers for consideration.  States throughout the country have been increasingly using diversion programs for defendants who committed offenses that stem from an underlying issue, such as drug addiction.
Supporters say diversion programs reduce both court and incarceration expenses, as as expenses connected to treatment programs.
Judges can order people to enter diversion programs in collaboration with prosecutors and treatment providers. Courts are also able to offer accountability to ensure defendants are complying with the conditions of the program and track the progress of defendants. Once defendants complete the rehabilitation program, the record for that offense is expunged and removed from their criminal records.
Pretrial diversion programs are effective. And expensive for participants.

Court proceedings will resume oftentimes if a person is unable to complete the treatment program or adhere to the conditions outlined by the judge. Under the bills, district attorneys may also remove people from diversion programs for a good reason.
“Right now, statutorily wise, the only courts that are set up by state statute are drug courts,” said Casey Bates, chief of staff for Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sarah Stewart who is helping to craft the legislation. “A number of different counties have set up mental health courts or veterans courts.”
Many times, diversion programs are not available to people unless they reside in an area that offers one they qualify for.
“We wanted to have a framework in place that is going to address any type of court that will be helpful,” Bates said. “Our goal is to keep people from offending again. We don’t want to send them to prison and then have them come back and reoffend. By setting up the accountability court, that is going to be the umbrella for any of the types of courts that are necessary.”
The bills require the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish a process and set policies  governing diversion programs.
The bills were amended as they went through the legislative process to allow courts to accept people referred by municipal courts within their jurisdiction and any contractor that is part of the program must be certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health.

(Arielle Robinson / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Seven Tulane University students who participated in a protest demanding the release of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention could face consequences from school administrators.
The students are alleged to have committed conduct violations and face a series of administrative hearings, students and their supporters said at a news conference last week.
They believe Tulane administrators are targeting them after a March 11 protest that was held off-campus near Tulane and Loyola University, where activists called on the schools to not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to make the schools sanctuaries for immigrant students, faculty and staff. The calls came after Khalil, a pro-Palestine protester and former Columbia University student, was arrested at his university apartment and sent to Jena, Louisiana, to await deportation.
“[Tulane] will suppress anyone who dares to exercise their First Amendment right to condemn them,” Tulane student Cameron McLaren said at the press conference.

This latest crop of disciplinary measures from Tulane is part of a nationwide wave of discipline that student activists have been met with for their pro-Palestine activism. Student organizers from Tulane and Loyola still face discipline, including semester-long suspensions, from the encampment or other pro-Palestine-related activism.
According to emails sent to two of those students and reviewed by Verite News, Tulane investigators contend that the students are associated with a group called Tulane Students for a Democratic Society. The group was suspended as a student organization by the university last year over a different unauthorized pro-Palestine protest and is currently forbidden from operating on campus.
The group, which now calls itself Together United Students for a Democratic Society, said in response in an Instagram post that the university is repressing students who are exercising their right to freedom of speech. The group now operates off-campus under a different name, though it continues to use a logo in university colors that is identical to the one it used when it was recognized by the university.
University spokesperson Michael Strecker declined to comment on the individual student conduct charges, noting that the code of conduct applies to student actions on and off campus.
“We fundamentally respect the right to protest,” Strecker said. “However, students may be held accountable for behavior if it violates university conduct policies.”
The students deny the university’s accusations, pointing out that the group has changed its name, met off-campus and didn’t hold the March 11 protest on school property.
Atticus Pratt, one of the students involved, is facing a probe called a “major matter investigation” that could lead to suspension or expulsion. Pratt said they had faced conduct charges before for their activism.
“They want to suspend students so we can’t go on campus and we can’t organize,” Pratt told Verite News. “They want to scare us out of continuing to organize. They want to make other people known that there will be consequences for joining an organization like SDS, or for attending an off-campus protest.”
Adelaide Ritzman, another student facing conduct charges, said they believe the university is violating the First Amendment rights of students who participate in such protests.
“Tulane is trying to figure out who they can scapegoat and who they can kind of make an example of,” Ritzman said.
New Orleans-area First Amendment attorney William Most, whose law firm has been involved in some of the legal matters surrounding protests at Tulane, agrees.
“Tulane may have violated federal law in its drastically harsher treatment of pro-Palestine students as compared to other students for comparable conduct,” Most said in statement to Verite News. “And [Tulane’s police department] in particular may have violated the First Amendment in its crackdown on students based on the content of their speech.”
As the Trump administration targets immigrant students and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education, some Tulane students say the school is cracking down on student speech beyond just protests.
McLaren, another one of the seven students facing discipline, said she was arrested and briefly detained earlier this month after briefly leaving her backpack unattended in the Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, which resulted in the evacuation of the building.
McLaren spoke up at the press conference publicizing the disciplinary allegations. She said she was walking around campus with a sign on her backpack that criticized the university’s decision to get rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion office and encouraged people not to attend Tulane because of it.
The note read: “Tulane just got rid of DEI…if you have the means, go elsewhere,” according to the Tulane Hullabaloo.
Strecker said McLaren was neither arrested nor charged.
According to Strecker, Tulane police were made aware of an abandoned backpack that had a note attached to it left on the Lavin-Bernick Center’s second floor. The university said the building was quickly evacuated due to safety concerns. University police immediately responded, investigated the event and eventually found that the backpack posed no threat and normal operations resumed after the location was deemed safe, the spokesperson said.
Tulane crime logs show that a “suspicious package” was reported in the building and that the case was closed with no further action being taken. The same website says that this term means that no further investigative action is needed.
McLaren declined further interview requests, but said in an email to Verite News that her “arrest and conduct charges are clearly politically motivated. I did not break any laws nor did I violate any conduct rules.”

Bello described wage theft, discrimination, threats to her and her family, withheld documents, and being unfairly fired. But, as a single mother, she said she’s had no choice but to keep working and endure these conditions to provide for her family. 
“It’s difficult to talk about this,” she said in Spanish, taking a deep sigh. 
When Bello started out as a housekeeper about four years ago, she said she worked independently and lived in the house where she was employed, an experience she described as isolating. Bello worked from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week, and said she was not allowed to spend time with her family. She also said she was never paid because her employers claimed to use her salary to cover her room and board. 
Bello then worked for a cleaning company where she said she continued to face abuse, like working from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. for a low fixed pay rate and with a lack of access to meals and breaks. Despite these conditions, she said it was an improvement from her previous job. However, when she raised some concerns to her employer, Bello said she was fired. 
“I was unaware of everything, I was unaware of minimum wage, unaware of what I should have been making,” Bello said. 
To address situations like this and other mistreatment domestic workers can face, Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle, introduced Senate Bill 5023, which would allow workers such as nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners to have access to minimum wage and overtime, workers’ compensation, meal and rest breaks, and written work agreements and terminations. 
“I feel like this work is what allows all the rest of us to be able to go to work,” Saldaña said. “[This bill] is making sure that the people that take care of our homes and our families and our children are also able to provide for themselves as well.” 
As it stands, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law, excludes domestic, farm, and hospitality workers. Their labor has been devalued because the majority of these workers were people of color, immigrants, and women, said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Fair Works Center. 
“When you have really entrenched ideas about ‘Is the work important? Is it really work?’ it’s part of how you can end up in a situation where mistreating certain workers and not giving them the same respect that you would give other workers can become normalized,” Alvarado said. 
In 2018, Seattle became the first city in the country to adopt legislation that’s similar to the bill now pending in the Legislature. It was implemented in late 2019. Months later, the pandemic hit and further complicated conditions for domestic workers. 
Alvarado said that the rollout of the Seattle law has helped inform the state bill. Though Bello works in Seattle, she said she previously did not know about the protections in the city law. 
The biggest difference in the state legislation compared to the Seattle policy is that it allows workers to retain personal effects such as legal documents and requires employers to create a written contract with workers. These provisions were added in response to input from workers who said they lacked evidence when verbal agreements weren’t met. 
The bill would also allow workers to file a retaliation claim against their employer with the Department of Labor and Industries. The agency could impose civil penalties up to $1,000 for each employer violation. 
Democrats in the Senate passed the bill on a 29-20 vote earlier this month, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition. If it receives final approval this year, the new protections for workers would take effect July 1, 2026.
Republicans argue that domestic workers are independent contractors who can set their own wages and hours and that the added requirements would create a burden for those hiring the workers.
“If we have all of this bureaucratic red tape that we have to go through, what kind of pressure would that put on others to hire?” said Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, in a floor speech.
Bello ​​takes pride in doing her job. “It’s something beautiful, it’s something that has helped me develop new skills such as being creative and organizing,” she said. 
She hopes others value domestic workers and acknowledge the rights they have both as workers and human beings. 
“We shouldn’t have to get to the point of abuse for our voice to matter, we shouldn’t have to get to the point where something scars us for the rest of our lives for our voice to matter,” Bello said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/housekeeper-cleaning-windows-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 08:09:21.348631

Not all 20-odd million of us, of course: We tend to be politically soporific, occasionally becoming passionate over potholes or maybe a too-short grouper fishing season, but preferring to keep reality at arm’s length. 
Still, something is changing. People are angry, auto-calling their representatives, making signs, demonstrating and showing up at town halls.
  U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn via U.S. House
MAGAs will tell you these are nothing but a bunch of disgruntled Democrats, but I’ll bet cash money a good number of those veterans protesting silently outside Tallahassee City Hall last week usually vote Republican. 
And I’ll bet a decent number, frightened and frustrated over President Musk’s scorched-earth attacks on the Department of Education, NOAA, USAID, etc. (it’s a terrifyingly long list), didn’t vote at all in 2024.
I overheard a couple of them talking about it during a recent town hall in Tallahassee. They both said they didn’t like either candidate: Harris was too pro-Israel, Trump was good at business (highly debatable) but a terrible person, and until now they never really thought it mattered who got elected.
Now they know.
The town hall was organized by the Democratic Party of Leon County, hoping to get our congressman to come and talk to us, his constituents. 
Rep. Neal Dunn was invited. He never even responded. He certainly didn’t show up.
Republicans don’t show up, not any more.
They don’t like getting booed. They don’t like facing outraged citizens.
A few tried holding town halls. Did not go well. But hey, at least they actually held town halls. Nobody’s seen hide nor hair of Florida Republicans. 
Maybe they’re huddled together in an undisclosed location. 
I doubt anyone expected to see either of our senators: Ashley Moody remains a MAGA acolyte, while Rick Scott held a telephone town hall once, but that was back during the pandemic.
Invisibility
Lawmaker invisibility hasn’t stopped constituents from arranging meetings and imploring these politicians — who allegedly work for them — to come and listen. 
Tampa Bay voters put on a town hall in Clearwater on March 15 in Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s district.
  Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, via U.S. House
She was, unsurprisingly, absent. Undeterred, a large crowd addressed a cut-out of her.
Some told the cardboard Luna they feared DOGE would wreck Social Security.
One lady, whose husband was fired from the U.S. Geological Survey in DOGE’s senseless purges, said, “I’ve called and I have emailed and heard nothing from you.”
Maybe Luna’s too busy lobbying to carve Trump’s face on Mt. Rushmore.
Luna doesn’t support Ukraine, and pitched a little hissy fit when Democrats waved the blue and yellow flag in the House, snapping, “Put those damn flags away!” 
But by God, she’s determined to get to the bottom of the great JFK assassination cover-up, demanding the doctors who treated JFK in Dallas and members of the Warren Commission who investigated it appear before Congress. 
Unfortunately for her and for the CIA/Cuba/KGB/Space Aliens conspiracy theorists, all those people are quite dead. 
No-show
Neal Dunn, last week’s no-show, is a urologist from Panama City and is, like Luna, one of the state’s least impressive members of Congress.  
He’s done absolutely nothing of note, unless you count his proposed resolution to “Protect American Businesses from Onerous Refrigeration Regulations.”
You’d think he might have bothered to attend a room of 500+ voters, eager to hear from him. 
It wouldn’t have been much of an inconvenience, either: According to his website, he was in Tallahassee that morning, hosting an event for young people who might want to attend one of the service academies. 
That event ended at 11 a.m.; the town hall started at 11 a.m.; the distance from City Hall to the American Legion Hall is 1.8 miles.
It would have taken him a solid five or six minutes to drive there.
Concerns
The standing-room-only audience created a list of what they’d like to talk about: the unelected Musk, DOGE’s trashing of government services, Ukraine, health care, reproductive rights, our endangered planet, our endangered entitlement programs, and our endangered democracy. 
A panel of worthies, including a county commissioner, a city commissioner, legendary activist Karen Woodall, and former Democratic congressman Alan Boyd, tried to address people’s issues. 
It wasn’t smooth sailing.   
Many were thoroughly annoyed with the good souls on the panel as well as the minority party in Washington. 
Democrats are good at lamenting, hand-wringing, and doom-predicting — all reasonable responses to the atrocities visited upon the country by President Musk and his henchpersons.
They just don’t seem to have much in the way of answers.
One guy stood up and yelled, “What’s the solution? I think we know the problem!”
Attack on universities
Sentient Americans understand the United States is being dismantled, hurled into a Dumpster, and set on fire. 
Rep. Dunn’s district contains six institutions of higher education. All receive federal funds. 
If DOGE gets its way and slashes the budgets of the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, what will become of research at FSU, FAMU, and other colleges and universities? 
FSU alone could lose $65 million. 
That would be a direct hit on the College of Medicine, all the science departments, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory — the largest and most important magnet lab in the world. 
It conducts experiments in (among other things) superconductivity, critical to efficient and sustainable energy sources. 
If that money goes away, it won’t just be scientific research that suffers: There will be a knock-on effect, harming the whole university. 
The best professors will leave; the best students won’t enroll; lots of people will be laid off.
What will happen to the hundreds of federal jobs at Tyndall Air Force Base at the western end of Rep. Dunn’s territory? How about the USDA Farm Service office in Madison at the eastern end?
Florida is home to 100,000 federal employees, most of them represented by Republicans. 
How about DOGE’s decimating NOAA and the National Weather Service? Florida’s entire Democratic congressional delegation warned that this was a Very Bad Idea.
No Republicans signed onto their letter.
Remember Michael?
Maybe Dunn thinks Florida doesn’t need hurricane forecasters; maybe he’s forgotten what Hurricane Michael did to his district in 2018. 
Without NWS it would have been even worse.

What would Dunn — or any of Florida’s senators and representatives— say to the 400 statewide who’ve lost their jobs with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service? Or the untold numbers who’ll soon be sacked by the Veterans Administration?
Dunn is a veteran himself, but he’s pretty offhand about their concerns. It’s only 20 “in the region” (whatever than means — VA jobs, maybe?
“This is not a massacre,” he said.
Maybe not to him, but the veterans protesting outside his recent event at Gulf Coast State College weren’t impressed: “There’s nowhere in the Constitution that what is going on with DOGE and Elon Musk is appropriate,” one told WJHG TV.
That’s putting it mildly.
But the Constitution doesn’t seem to matter to DOGE, President Musk, Trump, or the Republican-controlled Congress.
Maybe it will mean something to the Supreme Court.
What do you say, Rep. Dunn?

Transparency and accountability are the answer.
The Employer Price Transparency Study – Round 5, conducted by RAND, has consistently  shown that Indiana’s hospital prices are among the highest in the nation, ranking 8th overall. Hoosier employers and employees are paying nearly three times what Medicare pays for the exact same services at the same hospitals — an average of 297% compared to the national average of 254%. This alarming statistic demonstrates a clear need for reform. 
These inflated hospital costs have a direct and negative impact on Indiana’s manufacturing sector. Every dollar spent on excessive health care charges is a dollar that cannot be invested in workforce development, technological advancements, or business expansion. 
In a global marketplace, our ability to compete hinges on our efficiency and our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. The current high cost of health care in Indiana makes it more difficult for manufacturers to offer competitive benefits packages and to allocate resources strategically for future growth. 
Since self-funded employers pay directly for their employees’ health care claims, escalating hospital prices translate to immediate and substantial increases in their expenditures. These rising costs force employers to allocate more resources to health care, potentially diverting funds from other critical business areas. Ultimately, the financial burden of high hospital prices significantly affects the sustainability and competitiveness of all employers, but most acutely self-funded insurance models. 
House Bill 1004 takes meaningful steps toward addressing this issue. It introduces measures to increase transparency in hospital pricing and to put pressure on exorbitant costs. For instance, the bill establishes a hospital facility fee excise tax for charges exceeding 265% of  Medicare facility fees.  
Under this legislation, nonprofit hospitals would be mandated to report aggregate data on billed services and their comparison to Medicare reimbursement rates. Nonprofit hospitals charging more than 300% of their modified Medicare reimbursement rate could forfeit their nonprofit status. These provisions are critical for bringing much-needed transparency and  accountability to our health care system.
The passage of HB 1004 is not just about lowering health care costs; it is about strengthening Indiana’s economy and ensuring a prosperous future for our manufacturing industry and its employees. By addressing the issue of high hospital prices, we can free up valuable resources that can be reinvested in our workforce, making Indiana a more attractive place to do business and create jobs.

(Cartoon by Daniel Ackley)Facing down a sea of her own seething constituents in Westfield on Friday, U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz’s town hall descended into a two-hour shouting match just minutes after it began.
Screams from the crowd were nearly constant, often drowning out the Republican representative as she took questions on a range of issues.
Constituents’ fury was wide-ranging: from outrage over inflation, tariffs and the national deficit; to concerns over health care and decreased government services; heated opposition to federal deportation efforts and spending cuts directed by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE); and frustration over President Donald Trump’s response to the Signal scandal at the U.S. Department of Defense.
“You work for us!” 
“We don’t trust you!”
“You’re a f****** liar!” 
“You’re not listening to us!”

Spartz, a third-term federal lawmaker who represents Indiana’s 5th Congressional District north of Indianapolis, struggled for nearly two hours to speak over the yells and boos.
And she isn’t the only Indiana public official being criticized for access, or a lack thereof. Examples abound, from Attorney General Todd Rokita to state lawmakers and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith.
Spartz’s event came shortly after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson advised Republicans to avoid town halls which have been attracting vocal critics of actions by Trump and Musk, who is leading an effort to ferret out waste and fraud that has included firing federal employees, halting some government payments and uprooting programs.
Spartz, however, did not heed that warning and faced hundreds of angry — often hostile — Hoosiers at town halls on Friday and Saturday, the latter held in Muncie.
She threatened at several points during the town halls to stop hosting such events, but repeatedly asserted her desire “to hear all sides” from “everyone in my district.”
“You don’t have to scream,” Spartz told Friday’s crowd in Westfield. “I’m glad that we have people that came here — and I understand your frustration. … That’s why I have these town halls. We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.” 










We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.


– Republican U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz


Some of Spartz’s GOP colleagues have been less inclined.
Republican U.S. Senators Jim Banks and Todd Young, as well as Reps. Mark Messmer and Marlin Stutzman, are among those being criticized for not holding or attending town halls. 
Banks, specifically, ignited a political backlash last week after he skipped a constituent-led “Empty Chair Town Hall” and instead sent donuts — a move critics called “a dismissive stunt.”
“The idea of people having access to government in a variety of ways is foundational to American representative democracy. On one hand, it shouldn’t have to be required — it should just go without saying that in a representative form of government law, public officials should speak to the people who put them in office,” said Gerry Lanosga, professor of journalism at Indiana University and board member for the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. 
“What we’re kind of seeing now is partly pushed by officials who get into office and just don’t want to engage with citizens more than beyond the ballot box,” he continued. “I think it’s a real concern. And I think it’s a real sort of black eye on American democracy if public officials want to insulate themselves from the voices of people.”
‘Chaotic,’ ‘frustrating’ town halls
During the weekend town halls, Spartz emphasized that her office “has an open door policy” and “wants to hear from you all.”
In Westfield, multiple constituents pushed back: “You never respond!” some said. Others left angrily in the middle of the event, shouting that Spartz “doesn’t actually want to hear from you — she doesn’t care what you think!”
In a post to X on Saturday, Spartz rebutted. 
“I don’t think (the) radical left has learned yet that shouting and screaming is not going to work — no one is going to be intimidated,” she wrote. “I still appreciate everyone who came to my town halls this week & hope at least some on the left were able to hear common sense policies we are trying to implement benefiting all Americans.”

Elsewhere in recent weeks, other members of Indiana’s congressional delegation have been absent from “empty chair” town halls across the state.
One of those hosted last week by Indivisible Northeast Indiana — part of a progressive national movement to “mobilize local activists to resist extremist polices” — drew hundreds to the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne.
Indiana House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta and state Rep. Kyle Miller, both Democrats, took the stage to answer questions from the public. Three of Indiana’s Republican congressional lawmakers — Banks, Stutzman and Young — were represented by empty chairs.
Banks, Indiana’s junior U.S. senator, instead sent donuts to the crowd.
He said on X that the Indivisible group consists of Democrats who are “anti-Trump/Banks,” and that town hall attendees seemed “really angry.”
“So I sent my favorite donuts hoping to lighten the mood,” Banks said.
A video about the donut delivery showed some at the event laughing and eating the donuts. Others weren’t so receptive.
“I’m going to throw up on them,” said one attendee. Another asked, “Why isn’t he here?” referring to Banks, while a third man said, “Tell him to go to hell.”
Jim Carpenter, co-founder of Indivisible Northeast Indiana, said in a statement that “the parlor trick of offering donuts” was “a waste of taxpayer money” and “ironic coming from someone pledging to eliminate fraud and waste in the federal government.”
When asked about the town halls, Banks’s staff gave the Indiana Capital Chronicle a single response: “No taxpayer dollars were used to purchase donuts.”

— Senator Jim Banks (@SenatorBanks) March 22, 2025

Young, separately, had met with the Indivisible group following a protest in front of his office.
A spokesperson for the senator told the Capital Chronicle that he “regularly meets with Hoosiers in a variety of formats, including attending meetings and events across Indiana, hosting constituent coffees, and holding virtual meetings with Hoosier groups when the Senate is in session.” Additionally, Young’s staff “meets with individuals and groups in all 92 counties.”
In Evansville, hundreds of protesters gathered earlier this month in “frustration” over refusals by Messmer, Indiana’s 8th District representative, to hold a town hall or engage with constituent concerns.
Hoosiers also pushed back after staff for U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin, who represents Indiana’s 9th Congressional District, “put a pause” on regularly scheduled office hours with constituents in Bedford.
Democratic officials have been more willing to continue town halls.
Rep. André Carson, whose district encompasses most of Indianapolis, hosted an hour-long virtual conversation last week, where he largely fielded questions about DOGE cuts. 
First Congressional District Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat from Highland, held a similar remote town hall in early March.
State officials face scrutiny, too
At the state level, Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith said he also remains committed to meeting face-to-face with Hoosiers.
Ahead of his Monday town hall in Franklin, Beckwith made clear in a post to X that, “I think going out into communities and having conversations is such an important part of being in public office.”
Even so, constituents are barred from responding to the lieutenant governor’s posts on the social media site.
Beckwith’s staff have previously suggested that “security” concerns prompted tighter interaction restrictions on X, and said the office’s social media accounts — along with the accounts for the two agencies that report to the lieutenant governor — are monitored by his team “in an effort to inform the public about activities and events.”
They cited the office’s social media policy, which states that “the focus of the social networking opportunities is to share information” about the agencies, while “larger discussions of political views and philosophies may be addressed elsewhere.”

Beckwith’s personal X account alternatively permits anyone to comment and reply on posts, for example.
Such limitations were not in place on social media accounts held by former Republican Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, nor are those restrictions in place Gov. Mike Braun’s official account.
The Capital Chronicle also received complaints from constituents who encountered issues when trying to contact the Indiana Attorney General’s Office by phone or email.
Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita maintained that Hoosiers have “unprecedented access to his office” but said staff are sometimes “bombarded, and we have overflow.”
“If a number is left, we call it back, for sure,” Rokita said about phone calls to the state agency. He noted that his office has “several full-time employee-equivalents” whose jobs are dedicated to “consumer outreach.”

Rokita referenced his “Eyes on Education Portal,” which at times has flooded and even “overwhelmed” the office with messages in “short period(s) of time.”
He also pointed to the agency’s employee handbook, which requires that “all phone calls, all emails — any contact — is to be returned in 24 business hours.”
“And if that doesn’t happen, there are consequences. It doesn’t happen often, but I executed one of those consequences a couple weeks ago, and I’m just sad to hear something like that. But if it’s a pattern, I promise I’ll get to the bottom of it,” Rokita said. “I pride myself on accessibility.”
Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray further held that it’s “super important” for state lawmakers to remain open and accessible to Hoosiers.
That “can be challenging,” though, during the legislative session.
“We’re super busy. I go, like everybody else, to at least one town hall … during the weekends, on Friday or Saturday. And most of mine this year have been pretty full and kind of robust conversations, which I really, really enjoy,” Bray said. “And I try pretty hard to answer emails and phone calls and things like that, but it is difficult to keep up with those because of the pace of session.” 
“Probably not unlike any others, I could stand a little bit of criticism for being slow to get back with people,” he continued. “But the folks’ input is super important. It helps me stay grounded and keeps my ear to the ground. The time I invest in that makes me a much better legislator.”

Lanosga described an “eroding, a kind of shrinking in the ability of people to get their voices heard by government officials, at all levels, from both sides of the aisle,” over the last three decades. Increasingly, he said, “the ears of the representatives or politicians aren’t hearing the voices of the people.”
“I think citizens — if they’re disturbed about lack of engagement or lack of responsiveness of elected officials — should pick up the phone. They should write letters. They can write letters to news media. They can write emails. They can do social media campaigns,” he said. “All of those things should be tools in the arsenal of arguing for these sorts of robust public debates and public discourse.”
While there can be “legitimate reasons” for public officials to limit accessibility — such as for physical safety — Lanosga cautioned that those justifications “can end up really pushing back the boundaries of people’s access to make their voices heard.”
“Citizens can go to meetings that are scheduled of governing bodies. But outside that, government officials don’t really have to talk to you if they don’t want to. I think it’s very serious,” he said. “And so in those circumstances, you’re right to kind of ask, ‘What’s the point of me even raising my voice if no one’s here to listen to it?’ And so that’s kind of the situation we’re getting into. And if people don’t start pushing back against it and reclaiming that territory, it’s really hard to get back.”

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)By the time Joanna Rogers got to give testimony at the Capitol on a bill that could one day help enshrine the right to a healthy and safe climate in Oregon’s Constitution, she and other speakers were told they’d have one, rather than two, minutes to make their case for or against the bill. The 11-year-old from Portland made fast edits to her testimony so she could cut straight to the heart of the matter.
“You are in charge of so many kids’ fates. Please do what you can,” Rogers told the lawmakers.
If passed, Senate Joint Resolution 28 would refer a ballot measure to Oregon voters in November to amend the state constitution so that it guarantees the “inherent, fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment, including but not limited to clean air, clean water, thriving ecosystems and a stable climate system.”
It would make Oregon one of four states to make such a promise to future generations in its guiding legal document and would allow Oregonians to sue the state government and its agencies if it reneges on that promise.
At the first public hearing for the bill Wednesday in the Senate Rules Committee, Rogers was among a crowd so packed with people hoping to give testimony that a second room was opened to accommodate them. More than 170 people submitted written testimony in support of the bill in advance of the hearing and 26 submitted written testimony in opposition.
Those opposed include large trade associations such as the Oregon Farm Bureau, Oregon Business & Industry, Associated Oregon Loggers and home building groups.
“We see this as a pathway to an endless stream of lawsuits against family farms and ranches,” Lauren Kuenzi, a lobbyist for the Oregon Farm Bureau, told lawmakers. “This will put the court in the driver’s seat, allowing them to shape public policy for a lot of industries.”
The bill’s chief sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, said it would not lead to lawsuits against private parties or individuals.
“The government has a responsibility to uphold constitutional rights. Private interests have no responsibility to uphold constitutional rights,” he explained.
Citizens could sue the Department of State Lands for permitting a new mining operation, but they could not sue the mining company under the amendment.
Sharla Moffett, a lobbyist for Oregon Business & Industry, expressed concern that it would raise environmental rights to the same level as the right to due process and equal protection under the Oregon Constitution, without clarifying what all those rights entail.
“The terms ‘clean air,’ ‘clean water,’ ‘thriving ecosystems’ and ‘a stable climate’ could be highly subjective and are not defined in the bill,” Moffett said.
The bill is cosponsored by state Sens. James Manning Jr., D-Eugene, Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, and Reps. Tom Andersen, D-Salem, Thủy Trần, D-Portland, and Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie.
Gamba, who tried to suppress tears as he gave testimony, described the need for the Legislature to meet climate change “as the existential threat that it is.” He said suing corporations over the environmental harm they’ve caused has proven to be extraordinarily difficult. But holding Oregon’s government accountable into the future could offer options.
“It’s a clever idea. It’s a bold idea. It allows voters to put an environmental rights amendment into our constitution and reclaim some of our power to stand up to big polluters,” Gamba said to applause in the hearing.
Among those in attendance was Miko Vergun, a 22-year-old plaintiff in the landmark youth climate case Juliana v. United States, filed a decade ago in U.S. District Court in Eugene against the federal government by 11 young Oregonians and 10 peers from several states.
The case, which attempted to hold the U.S. government accountable for accelerating global climate change through lawmakers’ policies and fossil fuel subsidies, never got a trial. It recently hit a dead end after the Supreme Court declined a petition from the plaintiffs to throw out a lower court’s decision to dismiss the case.
Vergun told the senators things might have been different if the state had guaranteed a constitutional right to a healthy climate for her and other young Oregonians.
“In states like Montana and Hawaii, young people like me have won their cases because their constitutions explicitly protect the right to a healthy environment. That’s why SJR 28 matters. It would give Oregonians the same chance to be heard and protected,” she said.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
The low, rock-covered berm juts like a crooked finger into the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. It doesn’t look like much now. When finished, though, this and other marine construction work under way in South Baltimore will become 10 acres of wetlands in a city desperately short of natural shoreline.
Roughly three quarters of Baltimore’s waterfront is lined with bulkheads, piers and brick promenades, hardening that severely limits habitat for waterfowl, fish and crabs. The Hanover Street project is the opening salvo in an ambitious effort to restore more than 50 acres of wetlands along 11 miles of shoreline in the long-neglected southern part of the city.
“A year from now, you’ll see a … freshly planted wetland that extends far out into the water,” said Brad Rogers, executive director of the South Baltimore Gateway Partnership. In league with the city and another nonprofit group, Parks and People Foundation, Rogers’ group is spearheading the restoration effort.
The Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, as it’s called, aims to protect disadvantaged communities in South Baltimore from increasingly frequent flooding and improve water quality there while also providing residents better access to the waterfront.
The initiative is part of a more expansive plan called Reimagine Middle Branch, a community-driven environmental justice movement to enhance the 19 neighborhoods in the area and reconnect them to the shoreline they’ve been cut off from for so long. The vision, Rogers said, is to transform what’s been called Baltimore’s forgotten waterfront into Baltimore’s next great waterfront.
For as long as anyone can remember, the Middle Branch’s shores have suffered from erosion, ship-channel dredging and filling of wetlands. People passing by on busy Hanover Street couldn’t even see the water because their view was blocked by a forest of phragmites.

“It used to be this wide open, deltaic environment with reeds and birds,” Rogers explained as he walked along the rocky berm under construction in the river.
Now, the invasive plants crowding the water’s edge have been removed. The berm, once finished, is to be topped with a layer of sand and organic material, into which wetlands vegetation will be planted. The berm and its plants will help dampen wave-driven erosion from storms and nuisance flooding, protecting a vital traffic artery. Gaps left in the offshore structure will provide access to quieter near-shore water for fish and waterfowl.
For the time being, a floating yellow boom stretches out from the shoreline encompassing the area undergoing a nature makeover. But even before the first blade of marsh grass gets planted, the project is drawing a crowd — of birds and fish.
“You put in this boom and suddenly you see herons, cormorants and menhaden along the shore,” Rogers said.
The Hanover Street wetland is expected to be completed later this year even as construction is planned to start on three other projects. Next up is rehabilitation of a 9-acre patch of marsh between two streets that parallel the river.
“What we’re doing is restoring [its] connectivity to the Patapsco and restoring it as a more ecologically functional marsh as opposed to wet soils and phragmites,” Rogers said.
After that, wetlands are to be added along the shore by Medstar Harbor Hospital, where flooding-aggravated erosion threatens the Middle Branch Trail along the waterfront and is crumbling three concrete piers standing forlornly in the water.
“We want to be able to expand and enhance that and make it a much more attractive place to spend time,” Rogers said.
More wetlands are planned along a tract known as Spring Gardens, the ironically named site of a BGE liquefied natural gas tank farm. The final project would restore woods and marsh at Smith Cove, where two stormwater outfalls now dump runoff from the developed uplands. A boardwalk and environmental education center are also planned there to connect with a new half-mile long waterfront park in Westport.
The waterfront park is to be built in conjunction with a new housing, office and retail complex, One Westport, the first phase of which began construction last year on a 43-acre swath of waterfront that’s sat barren for decades awaiting redevelopment. A coal-burning power plant once occupied part of the site, and an unknown quantity of potentially toxic ash from the facility was buried at a spot now largely paved over, according to an inventory of coal ash disposal sites.

“For the first time in history,” Rogers said, Westport residents “will have access to their own waterfront.”
Unlike many previous urban redevelopment efforts, under Reimagine Middle Branch, the South Baltimore group has worked with leaders and residents of the area’s neighborhoods to plan the Westport park’s amenities, including a playground, outdoor gathering space, kayak launch and a memorial to the Black Sox Negro League baseball team.
“We’re not telling them how they want to develop, and we’re not telling them what kind of investment they’re looking for,” said Rogers. “We’re helping them choose.”
In conjunction with the physical upgrades, the partnership also has sponsored a series of activities and events, including boat cruises in warm weather and ice skating in winter, to encourage residents to come to and reclaim their waterfront.
The partnership has raised about $67 million just for the shoreline restoration work, with much more to be lined up for the Westport park and other elements of Reimagine Middle Branch.
About $40 million of the funds provided so far came from federal agencies. With the Trump administration trying to freeze or cancel many grants and Congress looking to slash spending overall, it’s unclear how much more federal financial support can be counted on.
“It is a time of uncertainty,” Rogers acknowledged, “and everyone involved in environmental restoration or economic development … is going to have to figure out how to be flexible and adaptive.” But the need is so great, he added, “The work can’t be stopped.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/67bf74f5aff91.image1_-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

The Gender, Prison, and Trauma Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law represents incarcerated women convicted of crimes related to their own gender-based victimization—intimate partner violence, rape and sexual assault, and trafficking. Despite their histories of victimization, the criminal justice system labels our clients offenders, often ignoring that they were victims long before they became criminal defendants.

Our clients frequently receive very long sentences — for defending themselves against abusive partners, acting under coercion or duress from abusive partners, or because they were unable to prevent their abusive partners from hurting their children. In cases involving felony murder and imputed liability, our clients are sentenced as though they were the people who carried out violent crimes, despite never having harmed anyone. Many of our clients are serving life in prison.
Sentenced to long prison terms, our clients use their time in prison as productively as they can — to seek education, engage in programming, and learn skills that make them employment ready. They do so much programming, in fact, that within a few years, there is nothing left for them to take.
Left to age in prison, our clients develop serious (and expensive to treat) medical issues. They grow old in a place that is not designed to meet the needs of the elderly. They are not dangerous. They are not violent.
Our clients use the limited legal options that are available to them to seek review of their sentences. But most of those processes are focused on legal errors, and so don’t take into account a person’s programming, growth, or positive institutional record.
The only pure review option, sentence modification, is severely time limited. Under current law, judges can only modify sentences if asked to do so within 90 days of the original sentence and within five years of the sentencing date. Judges are often disinclined to reconsider sentences that close in time to the original ruling and our clients may not have had time to amass the kind of record that might make a judge reconsider a sentence within that short period.
Opponents of the Second Look Act argue that individuals who have been convicted of crimes of violence — the kinds of crimes that generate long sentences — are the “worst of the worst.” Our clients are far from the worst. They have been convicted of crimes of violence, but they are not violent people. They are mothers and grandmothers, sisters and aunts. They are eager to show their sentencing courts the hard work they have done while incarcerated.
They could be productive members of society if given the opportunity. All they ask is for the chance to make that case in court.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1440229538-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

The bill then stalled on the next step, and a month passed before the House Rules-Legislative Committee approved it for placement on the calendar for debate. Now, as April is about to begin and lawmakers have only seven weeks to complete their work, it is uncertain whether that debate will take place.
The bill has the backing of House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit, but he’s not sure the rest of the GOP caucus is ready to follow him.
“It’s a matter of, do we have a majority of the people in the chamber that feel the same way?” Patterson said Thursday at the weekly House Republican news conference. “That I don’t know.”
For more than five years there have been legislative efforts, ultimately unsuccessful, to expand legal gambling through video lottery games and sports wagering — and to shut down unregulated games offering cash prizes that can be found in bars, truck stops and convenience stores across the state.
The proliferation of what are called gray market machines is one of the best arguments for authorizing video lottery games, Patterson said.
“If people are doing it, I would rather have them regulated and taxed and to make sure that kids aren’t doing it,” he said. “So I’m in favor of the bill itself.”
The legislation sponsored by state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, has been revised since it was introduced and another major revision is awaiting action on the House floor. To win votes, an amendment Hardwick intends to propose would cut the number of machines allowed at each location to eight and add provisions allowing local governments — cities for incorporated areas, counties for unincorporated locations — to conduct votes on whether to allow video lottery terminals.
He also removed all provisions of the bill that would have eliminated the gray market machines. Instead of phasing them out six months after video lottery is launched, retailers could keep them if they prefer rather than become lottery outlets.
They could not have both.
 State Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, speaks March 25 on the Missouri House floor (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Last week, Hardwick had a pad of lined paper in hand, going from member to member on the floor to see if he had enough votes.
“I think that we can pass it out of the House,” Hardwick said. “I think that we should pass it out of the House.”
The best argument he has for the bill, Hardwick said, is its potential to produce revenue for state education programs. Gov. Mike Kehoe didn’t recommend a $300 million increase in the state public school formula that would fully fund the program, calling it too expensive.
According to the fiscal note, video lottery would produce $112 million in the first year and almost $350 million a year when fully operational.
There is a substantial surplus currently in the state general revenue fund, but revenues are not growing and the Republican majority wants to cut state income taxes. 
“A lot of my members are thinking about the fact that the state’s going to have some tough budget times ahead, and by making a few regulatory and structural changes, we could change revenues without raising taxes on people,” Hardwick said.
For several years, the issue of gambling was a triangular debate. 
Casino companies and professional sports teams eager for the revenue from sports wagering opposed the video game vendors pushing for the new form of lottery game. Both were opposed at times by lobbyists for Torch Electronics, the largest of the gray market operators and a prolific political giver.
Torch didn’t want any bill that would make the law clear on the legality of its games.
It has been active both in the legislative halls and the courtroom, where it unsuccessfully sued the Missouri State Highway Patrol to block criminal investigations of its machines. 
A representative of Torch declined to comment on the revised bill.
A campaign organized by major sports teams and bankrolled by online betting platforms in November won approval of sports betting for Missouri. While that issue is off the table, casinos aren’t backing down from their opposition to video lottery games.
The number of people visiting Missouri’s 13 casinos in the final six months of 2024 was down 25% from the same period of 2019, which is about the time the unregulated machines were making their debut. The remaining casino gamblers are each losing more, on average, and net winnings for the casinos have gone up 8% in that same period.
What the figures say is that small-dollar players are choosing to play the unregulated machines, said Michael Winter of the Missouri Gaming Association.
The association considers the unregulated machines to  be criminal gambling devices and the proposal for video lottery to be unconstitutional. The only place slot machines are legal, he said, is in the 13 casinos licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
“I don’t think the market has stopped growing when you look at either illegals or the potential that putting in more slot machines than every location around the state could have on our properties,” Winter said. “So we think there’s still more downside and revenue we could lose if bills like this are passed.” 
The bill’s controls on improper play, such as by people under 21, are too loose, Winter said.
“They don’t have set aside rooms,” he said. “They don’t have licensed personnel overseeing the machine. You’ve got a person at the counter who’s in charge of making sure that only 21-year-olds play the machines.”
The changes in Hardwick’s proposed amendment are essential to winning passage, said Andy Arnold, a lobbyist for J & J Ventures, a vendor for video lottery games.
He thinks a bipartisan majority of the House can be assembled to pass the bill, but it would be close. To get to the Senate, a bill must win 82 votes from the 163-member House.
A provision that requires the games to be in a place “distinct and divided from the primary business operation area” was important to calming fears that minors may be playing the games.
Arnold has been working to get video lottery legalized for 10 years. The arguments from the casinos are more about market share than legality, he said.
“It’s just a matter of time before people see through and see that it’s nothing more than competition,” Arnold said. “They don’t want the competition. But they’ve already got the competition from the illegal machines.”

(Barbara Shelly/for Missouri Independent)Friends and family arrived bearing flowers. Smiling volunteers pointed the way to seats.
Everyone loves a naturalization ceremony. I attended one recently at a branch of the Kansas City Public Library and watched 71 new American citizens swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. Even more immigrants had taken the oath earlier in the day.
“This room is full of the most brilliant minds that the world knows,” Wasim Khan, a cultural leader, told the group. “You guys are the teachers. You know what it takes to be here.”
After the ceremony, as League of Women Voters volunteers swooped in to invite the new citizens to register, I asked a few people how long they have been in America.
Eight years, 12 years, too many years to count.
Naturalized citizenship is a long, expensive process and everyone who achieves it does so through a combination of grit and good fortune.
I’ve attended several of these ceremonies over the years to cheer on people I’ve had the privilege to know.
One was a piano teacher who came here from Kyrgyzstan to study at American universities. Several others arrived as refugees. They overcame language barriers and all the hardships of poverty to arrive at their naturalization ceremonies as educated, hardworking contributors to their communities.
The recent ceremony was no different from others I’ve witnessed, but I couldn’t summon the usual measure of joy.
Rather, I kept wondering what a naturalization ceremony will look like once the xenophobic policies of the Trump administration have been fully brought to bear.
Last year, I signed up to participate on a team that would sponsor a refugee family, in cooperation with a resettlement agency. I told myself that it would be a satisfying act of resistance in case Donald J. Trump won the presidency.
Along with others, I welcomed a family of eight at Kansas City’s airport on a snowy evening 12 days before Trump’s inauguration. They were exhausted and one person was ill but they were here and we were ready to introduce them to America.
We had no idea how difficult that was going to be.
Within a week of taking office, Trump had slammed the door to new refugee admissions and cut off funding for the families who had recently arrived.
The resettlement community had anticipated the first move. It was gobsmacked by the second. With an executive order, Trump wiped out money that was supposed to pay for rent and utilities, medical screenings and other services for hundreds of people who had entered the United States legally in the last 90 days.
Agencies went into emergency fundraising mode, but Trump’s action was crippling. The agency I volunteer for lost nearly $1 million of federal money it had counted on. Part of that amount was already spent in rent deposits and other costs.
It’s nearly impossible to cover a gap like that through donations. Within weeks two agencies in Kansas City laid off close to half their staffs. A smaller nonprofit laid off its entire refugee services staff. A mid-Missouri agency shut down its resettlement program.
My role in the resistance now includes scanning job ads for something that might work for adults who speak only a little English and will have to ride to work on the bus. I’ve become familiar with the difficulties of booking an appointment at the local Social Security office — and good luck once Elon Musk gets through with that program.
The family that my team works with was routed from their ancestral home and spent years in limbo in a neighboring country. The adults are fully aware that the leader of the United States does not want them here.
Their status is legal, but they are afraid. They grieve family members left behind in a refugee camp, clinging to hopes of a reunion that may not happen in this lifetime.
In my head, I construct sentences that begin with “at least.”
At least they aren’t here on humanitarian parole status — a category of immigrants more endangered than refugees.
At least they have a place to stay, a small rental house in a hollowed-out part of Kansas City. A recent New York Times story reported on newly arrived refugees in St. Louis languishing in motels on highway interchanges because the resettlement agency there was unable to pay apartment leases.
At least members of my family have friends. Immigrants from their home country have sought them out and embraced them.
The situation could always be worse. But it is bad enough.
Refugee resettlement is a way of participating in the global good. Therefore, it is not a priority in Trump’s “America First” agenda.
The immigrants whom I witnessed as they became naturalized citizens last month represented 36 nations, including some of the most troubled, like Haiti, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They had cleared a high bar to get to the ceremony. All of them passed a civics test that most Americans would find daunting. They were deemed to be of “good moral character,” a standard that we don’t necessarily demand from our nation’s leaders.
Congratulations to the new Americans. May we always find a path for them.

I had just gotten out of an eye appointment, having picked out a new set of blue, thick-rimmed glasses. [&#8230;]","The Idaho Capital Sun staff at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. From left to right are reporter Mia Maldonado, editor-in-chief Christina Lords, reporter Kyle Pfannenstiel and senior reporter Clark Corbin. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The first conversation I had with Andrea Verykoukis, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of a Boise Eyemart Express with my cellphone on speakerphone on a cloudy day in late January 2021.
I had just gotten out of an eye appointment, having picked out a new set of blue, thick-rimmed glasses. That’s because, two days before, I had just been fired from the Idaho Statesman and needed to renew my prescription before I lost my health insurance. (If you don’t know that story, maybe I’ll tell it to you over a beer someday; if you do, know I am still a fierce Excel advocate and an advocate for making sure our reporters have the tools they need to do their jobs.)
Andrea, along with Chris Fitzsimon and a host of other talented journalists, had been hard at work launching or partnering with nonprofit news organizations focused on state politics and policy in all 50 states through States Newsroom, now the Idaho Capital Sun’s parent nonprofit and the reason our outlet exists.
I have to be honest here. After the firing, and after 12 years of journalism — 11 of them at newspapers in Idaho — I wanted out. I was looking at master’s programs to go be the librarian my mom always thought I should be and applying to public relations jobs I thought might fit.
But Andrea asked one question: What is going under covered and under reported in Idaho? And then she went quiet.
I think I rambled on for about 30 straight minutes about how public education has been chronically underfunded and our educators have been demoralized here, about how the shortages our health care workforce we faced even before COVID were in dire straights now, about how wildfire and mismanagement of federal public lands was threatening the places I grew up visiting, about how the Idaho Legislature every year comes with legislation to make it harder for Idahoans to cast a ballot or run a citizens initiative in our elections.
And I’ll never forget what Andrea said: “Well. It sure seems like you have more stories in you to tell. What do you think about launching a nonprofit focused on state politics in Idaho through States Newsroom?”
Then she explained that as a nonprofit news organization, States Newsroom allows any other media outlet to pick up our work — for free — with proper credit and attribution.
I thought of all the times sitting around the conference room at my first reporting gig covering local government and crime at the Moscow-Pullman Daily News and praying that larger news organizations could report on some of the tips and stories that we just couldn’t get to with our small, young staff. Of all the times I had to say no to stories worth pursuing at the Post Register in Idaho Falls as I stumbled my way through my first legislative session in 2013 because there just weren’t enough reporters to get them all done. And of all the times at the Idaho Press when I was assistant editor where we lost good, young reporters that we had spent years building up their reporting chops, figuring out complex local government systems and backstories, just to see them forced to take a PR job because journalism wasn’t paying their bills.
If we could help other Idaho newsrooms — and by extension, their Idaho readers — by providing in-depth coverage of the Statehouse, maybe, I thought, we could make an impact.
I took a week to talk myself out of it. I dove alone to Balanced Rock in Twin Falls County to explore somewhere I had never been in Idaho, to hike, to watch Salmon Falls Creek sweep by me, to see our farm fields laid out as far as the eye could see, to think. It was there I decided there was some journalism still left in me, and I was compelled to try.

I thought for sure we’d launch the Idaho Capital Sun, it wouldn’t work, and in a year say, well, we tried.
But that’s not what happened.
While Idaho newsrooms are very competitive and want to be first, right and contextual, they also understand Idahoans have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent, and who is making the decisions that affects their daily lives and their futures.
The very first newsroom to pick up one of our stories, on the first day we launched, March 31, 2021 — four years ago today? The Idaho Statesman.
But it certainly wasn’t the last. To States Newsroom, the measure of our success isn’t tallied by click quotas for reporters or page view website traffic. It’s how many of our stories are good enough and helpful enough to be picked up by other newsrooms, so we track those metrics instead.
Just this month, the Idaho Capital Sun’s stories were picked up online by other news outlets 240 times, largely in Idaho but some also nationwide. And 62 of our stories this month have made it into print. And that’s just what we can monitor and categorize, likely a huge undercount of just how far our work travels.
Our work is picked up everywhere by the fine folks at the the weekly Sandpoint Reader to my hometown TV news station KPVI in Pocatello. By the Rexburg Standard Journal, by the ever-expanding BoiseDev online, by the Twin Falls Times-News and by another newspaper I called home for four years, the Idaho Press in Nampa. The Idaho Capital Free Press picks up our work in Grangeville, and so does the News-Examiner for their readers in Bear Lake and Caribou counties. Our work traveled across the country this month in publications like USA Today; the Adirondack Daily Enterprise in Saranac Lake, New York; Spokane Public Radio; and the Fox 26 TV station in Medford, Oregon.
And we return the favor. At the bottom of every one of our newsletters, the Sunrise, which you can sign up for online for free, I include a collection of links to the work of other Idaho news outlets the produce every day. I think a lot about our state’s news ecosystem, and we aim to bring to the forefront the hard work, under tough economic and political circumstances, that reporters are providing to the Gem State and her residents.
As I mentioned before, the Idaho Capital Sun is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so donations from readers like you are what keep our lights on. It’s what keeps not only our readers informed at IdahoCapitalSun.com, but it also keeps the tens of thousands of readers of other hardworking Idaho news organizations informed, too.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
I never thought we’d last a year. Now, among the most chaotic and challenging news cycle and political climates I have ever faced in the 16 years I’ve been a professional journalist, I’m reminded every day just how essential our role is to meeting this moment. Because we have reporters originally born and raised here or who have lived here for decades, I’ve never felt more capable of reflecting the things Idahoans experience and want to know about in our work. I’ve never felt more “sure in my skis,” as they say, never been more confident in our ability to make change and help people understand their world around them.
If you’ve ever sent a note of encouragement or supported us financially over the last four years, through donations large or small, one-time or recurring, thank you for helping us grow and thrive. You are the reason we are celebrating our fourth anniversary today. If you’re new to the Idaho Capital Sun and our work, welcome. We hope you find value in what we do here.
And especially to our hard working reporting staff, Mia Maldonado, Kyle Pfannenstiel and Clark Corbin, our senior reporter who has been with us since the day we launched, thank you for waking up every day and fearlessly heading into spaces to shine the light of truth. I’m the luckiest editor in Idaho to work with people like you.

Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments, the author writes.","It’s time for Gov. Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments, the author writes. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)By Patrick DiRoma, co-founder of Bergen County Complete Streets
Three months into the long-awaited congestion pricing program, the signs are clear: congestion pricing works.
The policy is doing what no amount of roadway expansions have managed to achieve – significantly reducing travel times, saving residents valuable time that they would rather spend doing anything other than sitting in traffic. And unlike adding more car lanes, as the proposed New Jersey Turnpike expansion would do, it is creating healthier and safer places to live, work, and play.
Drivers and bus riders are seeing first-hand the benefits of reduced traffic as a result of congestion pricing, particularly near the bridges and tunnels that connect New Jersey to Manhattan.
Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Murphy and other New Jersey representatives are continuing to waste time and money attacking congestion pricing when they should be focused on improving the Garden State’s own transportation system. Their attempts to sue New York over this policy sent a clear message: They would rather maintain a broken status quo instead of providing high-quality public transit improvements that meet the transportation needs of hard-working New Jersey residents.
Such improvements would reduce the number of cars on the road, shorten commutes, improve air quality, and create opportunities to use space in ways that best serve people rather than vehicles. Congestion pricing is a policy that is actually addressing this problem head-on and New Jersey should be learning from it, not fighting it.
New Jersey deserves to have convenient, high-quality, and reliable transportation options and safer, cleaner streets, and that means investing in infrastructure that provides alternatives to driving, something that every administration in my lifetime has failed to deliver.
In pursuit of this goal, New Jersey can start by creating dedicated bus lanes on the George Washington Bridge. This can be implemented quickly and at minimal cost by partnering with New York. It would allow 10 times as many people to get across the bridge as compared to a regular vehicle lane; high-capacity buses would no longer be stuck in the same traffic as cars.
The state can also expedite the extension of the Hudson-Bergen light rail to Bergen County, which both the Bergen County executive and county commissioners support. Other states have expedited transit projects through targeted exemptions from environmental impact studies. Given the overwhelming environmental benefits of public transit, New Jersey should be doing the same.
Finally, New Jersey residents need access to safe infrastructure for growing micro-mobility. Many residents already use devices like scooters and bikes for last-mile access to our state’s transit stations, and it is time to provide the infrastructure necessary to keep them safe and enable more local trips to be done in ways that don’t contribute to traffic and congestion.
Congestion pricing is already encouraging people to think differently about transportation. More and more people are realizing the harsh reality of a transportation system built solely for cars: if everyone drives, nobody moves. Public officials must commit to improving mass transit and expanding alternative transportation options if we want to have safe, healthy communities instead of endless traffic, congestion, and pollution.
Sadly, some of our representatives are choosing to be fear-mongers instead of leading. They would rather promote a handful of sensational crime incidents around transit, hoping the public ignores the traffic violence that has not only become routine on our streets but has gotten worse, with 691 traffic fatalities in New Jersey last year alone.
New Jersey’s mass transit system is something few other states have, and people should feel empowered and motivated to utilize this amenity that connects us to the wider region. Furthermore, people should demand that service be valued, improved, and expanded by our elected leaders to meet the state’s transportation needs.
From Bergen County and beyond, the benefits of congestion pricing are clear. We should be celebrating it as the step forward it is and not allowing lawmakers to distract us with an obvious smear campaign against the program for political gain. Congestion pricing is a regional fix for a regional problem — improving connectivity for commuters and reducing traffic and gridlock throughout the area. It’s time for Gov. Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments instead of trying to tear down others.

The bills that advanced make up just over 20% of the roughly 1,960 House measures filed at the start of session. And while a supermajority of those were authored by Republicans, a record number of Democrat bills advanced, the House minority leader said. 
Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, attributed the chamber’s success to a two-tiered committee system with new oversight committees that he implemented this session. 
“We went into the evenings a few nights, but you never saw any super late nights,” he said Thursday during a media availability. “I think this might be the first session I’ve experienced, at least that I can remember, where we weren’t in here past 10 p.m. hearing legislation. And I think that’s kudos to our new two tier committee system, where bills, when they made it to the floor, they were ready for primetime because members put in work on their bills on the front end.”
Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said 29 Democratic bills were sent over to the Senate this year. 
“I think that’s a record for us. In the last several years we’ve been working well with the Republican caucus to get our bills done,” she said Thursday. “But you know, our members have worked really hard on our priorities and working across the aisle and looking for things that solve problems for Oklahomans.”
Of the hundreds of bills that passed through the House, some have garnered more attention. House lawmakers advanced:

House Bill 1003 that seeks to raise the age sexual of consent in Oklahoma from 16 to 18 years old; 
a bill creating the first residential setbacks for wind turbines, requiring they be half a nautical mile from dwellings and 1.5 times the turbine’s height from neighboring property lines. A similar measure passed the Senate, but with smaller setback requirements; 
legislation creating a new felony for being in the U.S. illegally that would repeal a controversial law that was signed last year; 
a ban on cellphone use in schools. The House sent legislation requiring a bell-to-bell ban to the Senate; 
two bills that would legalize sports betting in Oklahoma, with exclusivity granted to tribes despite the threat of veto from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt; 
a bill allowing health care providers to refuse to offer specific procedures or care based on moral, religious or conscientious beliefs is on its way to the Senate. It advanced despite earlier opposition from Oklahoma physicians;
a handful of bills from Rep. Suzanne Schrieber, D-Tulsa, addressing child care issues in the state. These measures include granting a tax credit to employers that provides childcare subsidies to employees and exempting the income of child care providers when applying for the Child Care Subsidy Program;  
a bill, which increases the amount a person who is wrongfully convicted can claim, advanced. It would allow wrongfully incarcerated inmates to claim $50,000 per year of incarceration. State law caps the compensation amount at $175,000; 
a bill increasing payments to foster care families intended to help families cover the cost of caring for a foster child by $5 per day; 
a bill requiring school districts to show a video on human growth and development while in the womb to high school students passed through the House; 
an effort to give the Oklahoma Attorney General the ability to investigate and enforce reported violations of the Open Records Act by public bodies; and

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.As Wisconsin school districts seek permission this week from voters to spend more than $1.6 billion for operational and building costs, state lawmakers are looking for ways to address the issue of schools’ growing reliance on referendum requests.
Voters across the state are deciding this spring on a total of 94 referendum requests including some in February and many in the upcoming April 1 elections. According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, it’s the most ever between January and April in a non-presidential or midterm election year and it’s the continuation of an ongoing trend.
Republicans have introduced three proposals for new limitations on the referendum process in reaction to Milwaukee Public Schools’ successful request last year, with lawmakers saying the proposals would increase fairness and transparency for voters and taxpayers. However, one Democratic lawmaker and other stakeholders said the proposals would limit local control and don’t address the structural financial issues that drive school districts to go to referendum.
Eliminating ‘recurring’ referendum requests
A bill coauthored by Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Town of Delafield) and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield)  would eliminate referendum questions that allow permanent operational funding increases and would limit other referendum requests to cover no more than a four-year period.
Duchow said in an interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that she doesn’t think there is a problem with school districts going to referendum and called them the “perfect tool” to allow local residents to make funding decisions. But she doesn’t think funding increases sought through a referendum should be permanent — or, in legislative terminology, “recurring” year after year. 
The referendum option was created for schools in 1993 as a part of legislation that put limits on schools’ ability to raise revenue by increasing property taxes. 
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials Association (WASBO), said in an interview that the idea behind the legislation was that property taxpayers would be protected and the state would take care of school districts financially in return. From 1993 to 2010, revenue caps — the limit on how much districts could raise without voters’ permission — were tied to inflation. The inflationary increases were eliminated in 2009 and state funding has not filled the gap to give schools an inflationary increase. 
According to WASBO, general school district revenues have lagged the rate of inflation for a decade and a half. If funding had kept up with inflation, districts would be getting $3,380 more per pupil in 2025.
Wisconsin schools also only receive funding for about a third of their special education costs and many are drawing from their general funds to keep up with providing expensive federally and state mandated services to students with disabilities. Districts are also dealing with declining enrollment, which results in lower funding for a district as there are fewer students even if fixed costs such as maintaining facilities may not fall.
School officials and advocates have pointed out that many districts are relying heavily on referendum requests to meet costs (even to keep schools open), saying the trend is untenable. Mauston School District is one example as school leaders were considering dissolving the district after two failed referendum requests until voters finally approved a request in February.
Chapman noted that when a referendum fails it can result in a school deferring maintenance, increasing class sizes and cutting staff, AP programs, language, support staff for special education, nurses, librarians, athletics and “all the things that kids need to kind of stay engaged in school.” 
Dale Knapp, director of Wisconsin-based research organization Forward Analytics, said in 2023 that he didn’t “think the lawmakers who created this law envisioned referenda being relied on this much.”
“Maybe the answer after 30 years of the limits is an in-depth review of the law to see how it can be improved to continue protecting taxpayers and ensure adequate funding of our schools,” Knapp said.
Duchow, however, said that the state is providing “plenty of money” to schools.
“If they want a new gym, that’s on them. I’m not here to build you a new gym. The people who live in that community should make that decision,” Duchow said. She also said there are some schools that probably need to consolidate and others that need to close.
While school districts do go to voters to fund building costs, many are also going to referendum for “operational” (and often recurring) costs and as a way to keep up with staff pay, afford educational offerings and pay utility bills.
Duchow said recurring referendum questions are unfair. She said lawmakers in the caucus have been discussing changing the policy for a while. A similar proposal was introduced in 2017.
“We are looking at declining enrollment around this state, and how do we know what we really need 10 years from now?” Duchow said. “The Milwaukee referendum never goes away, so 10 years from now, we have less students in Milwaukee and we need the same amount of money?  We have more technology coming in, which means we probably need less teachers.” 
Duchow said Milwaukee’s $252 million operating referendum, which was the second largest school operating request in state history, was the “catalyst” for her bill.
Republican lawmakers and other state leaders have been highly critical of the request, which the district said was needed to fund staff pay and educational programming and voters narrowly approved. The criticism grew louder after the district’s financial crisis that resulted in the resignation of the superintendent and audits launched by Gov. Tony Evers.
“Enough is enough. MPS is a disaster. We have the worst reading scores in the nation, and all they do is scream they need more money,” Duchow said. “Money is obviously not the answer.”
Even with declining enrollment, the Milwaukee Public School District is the largest district in the state with 65,000 students enrolled, according to the 2024-25 enrollment data from DPI. This is over 2.5 times as many students as the next largest district in Wisconsin, Madison Metropolitan School District.
MPS students are also more likely to face significant challenges. More than 20% of students in the district have a disability, more than 80% are economically disadvantaged and 17.5% are English language learners. Statewide about 40% of students are economically disadvantaged, 15.7% are students with disabilities and 6.92% are English language learners.
Chapman said students with higher needs often incur higher costs for districts. 
Duchow said that putting a four-year limit on referendum requests for recurring funds gives communities the ability to react to changing circumstances and that school districts should justify to voters why they need the funds. She said she would be open to discussing a different limit when it comes to nonrecurring referendum requests.
“It’s also not fair that everybody could vote for that referendum and then decide, hey, this is really too expensive. I can’t afford these property taxes and then they move out, and I’m still there paying the referendum,” Duchow said. 
Duchow said she hadn’t yet spoken with any school district leaders when she was interviewed by the Examiner in early March, but planned to reach out before a public hearing on the bill.
“I’m sure I can already tell you how the schools are going to feel. The schools are going to feel they want their recurring referendum, just like we want your boss to give you a 20% raise every year without you justifying why you should get it,” Duchow said. “That’s what the schools want, too. I don’t blame them. I would, too, but we can’t do that to our taxpayers.”
According to the Wisconsin Eye on Lobbying website, the Wisconsin Education Association Council has registered against the bill, while the Wisconsin REALTORS Association has registered in favor.
Lawmakers have added new restrictions to school referendum requests before. The 2017-19 state budget limited scheduling of a referendum requests to only two per year and only allowed them to be held on regularly scheduled election days.
“It used to be that referendums could be called by a school district at any time, but the Legislature said… we don’t want you to have the option to run so many referendums,” Chapman said. 
Chapman noted in an interview that recurring referendum requests pass at lower rates than other types because it is harder to convince taxpayers. She said voters “know how to handle this” and lawmakers shouldn’t further reach in to restrict district’s options.
“Some districts and some communities want a recurring referendum,” Chapman said. “School districts have the option of asking for recurring and sometimes they do and voters sometimes approve them because they’re asking to fill structural budget holes that are never going to go away. They’re asking for basic operating dollars that they’re going to need in four years.” 
A recent Marquette Law School poll found that Wisconsinites are becoming increasingly concerned with holding down property taxes since 2018 and less favorably inclined toward increasing funding for K-12 public schools. 
Chapman noted that districts also often make nonrecurring referendum requests for recurring costs because they are an easier ask, though this places districts in another difficult position.
“As soon as you go to nonrecurring referendum in this environment with grossly inadequate state funding and state policies to support schools financially, you are now going to be in your own personal fiscal cliff,” Chapman said. “You’re going to have to go again, and probably for more, because your costs have gone up and funding does not keep up with inflation.” 
Bills meant to provide ‘fairness,’ ‘transparency’
Lawmakers, concerned about the MPS referendum, requested a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo last year that found some school districts in Wisconsin could see a decrease in state aid after the MPS referendum due to the way that equalization aid is calculated.
Equalization aid acts as a form of property tax relief, according to the Wisconsin School Business Officials Association. The amount of aid a district receives from the finite pot of money distributed by the state is determined by a formula that depends on a district’s property wealth, spending and enrollment.
Spending triggered by referendum requests is one factor in determining districts’ equalization aid, and Milwaukee — like other districts with low property wealth per pupil compared to the rest of the state — will receive more state aid per pupil than other districts with higher property wealth per pupil as a result of its increased spending from the referendum.
Chapman noted, however, that all 148 referendum requests for operating expenses in 2024 affect the share of equalization aid districts receive. She also emphasized that it’s not the only factor affecting the amount of aid districts get.
“Some districts have increasing enrollment, which means they’re going to pull more money away from Milwaukee.” Chapman said. “There’s all of these factors that affect every single district, and they intertwine with each other.”
Republicans viewed Milwaukee’s referendum as taking too much from other districts. 
“Is it fair to the students, parents and taxpayers in Waukesha, Madison, Wautoma and others suffer without having the right to cast a vote?” the bill authors Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) and Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) asked in a memo. “Local school referendums should not have a significant negative impact on other districts. Simple fairness demands this type of thinking.”
The lawmakers’ bill would exclude any district referendum request worth more than $50 million from being considered when determining equalization aid. The effect of the bill would be that districts that pass a large referendum would have their aid eligibility reduced, leaving local taxpayers to pay more of the cost. The bill would only apply to districts below a certain property wealth value.
Chapman said the bill would penalize districts for being larger and having lower property wealth and is an example of lawmakers trying to micromanage local entities.
A final bill introduced by Allen and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) would require that tax impact information be added to ballots. Currently, referendum ballot questions are required to include the dollar amount of the increase in the levy limit.
Under the bill, referendum questions would also need to include the estimated interest rate and amount of the interest accruing on the bonds, any fees that will be incurred if the bonds are defeased and a “good faith estimate of the dollar amount difference in property taxes on a median-valued, single-family residence located in the local governmental unit that would result from passage of the referendum.” 
Proposal criticisms
Freshman Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said he wasn’t inclined to support a ban on recurring referendum requests given the inconsistency in state funding. 
“We go through this sort of toxic [state] budget cycle every two years and districts have to levy, and they don’t even know what to plan for, so recurring referendums are obviously a response to that,” Phelps said.
Phelps said the question of fairness is relevant when talking about the referendum process, but the framing of the Republican proposals is misguided, given the state’s over $4 billion budget surplus.
“It is not fair to taxpayers that, depending on what school district you live in, you might have an astronomical property tax bill just to keep that district running. That’s not fair,” Phelps said. He said the state of Wisconsin is “underfunding public schools and not using the taxes people already paid.”
Derek Gottleib, an assistant professor at the University of Northern Colorado and senior research director for School Perceptions, an education research firm, said Republicans appear to be “operating on behalf of the taxpayers across the state who have voted no on school referendums and yet lost and so had their taxes raised anyway.”
“Suddenly, because so many [referendum requests] are passing, homeowners, taxpayers who don’t want to have their taxes raised are saying that this is unfair or we shouldn’t have to have our taxes raised just because everybody in our community wants to raise our taxes and Republicans are coming to the defense of those folks,” Gottleib said. 
According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, while the number of requests continues to rise, approval rates have started to decline with the 66.2% approval rate in 2024 being the lowest in a midterm or presidential election year since 2012.
Gottleib said some of the concerns raised by lawmakers are valid. For example, he said the current terms used to describe referendum questions are “obscure” and unclear.
“Why not just say a permanent referendum and a temporary referendum?” he asked. “You could do a lot to increase the transparency of what people are voting on if you made that little language change.” 
Gottleib also said that he does have “sympathy” for those who don’t think there should be permanent funding requests, but acknowledged that this would have consequences for districts because it removes predictability in planning.
However, he said he doesn’t agree that the potential for people to move out of a community or into a community in the future should be the deciding factor in funding decisions. 
“That’s a basic feature of any community anywhere,” he said. 
The argument that “it is not a legitimate exercise of public governmental power to make a decision for a community, given the fact that the community will change in the future…is ridiculous,” Gottleib said. “If that were the case, it would make all public decisions fundamentally illegitimate.”
The increasing number of referendum requests, Gottleib said, is a sign that revenue limits are set too low, at an amount that is unacceptable to community members. He noted that when operational referendum requests fail, the schools typically cut theater arts, advanced placement coursework, second language instruction, foreign language instruction and other programs that aren’t required by the state.
Chapman called the proposals a “BandAid” on the issues districts are facing that “isn’t even really fixing the problem.” 
“[If] legislators really wanted to protect taxpayers and make sure schools have what they need, they would do something like keep revenue limits inflationary [and] significantly improve the funding for special education, which would help every single kid,” Chapman said.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Watercraft inspection stations managed by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture are open for the 2025 season. 
This means all boat owners — regardless of their watercraft size, propulsion, motorized or non-motorized — must stop for mandatory inspection when traveling past an inspection station during operating hours. 
Inspection stations are essential to prevent invasive species, such as quagga mussels, from entering Idaho’s waterways. Quagga mussels were first discovered in the Snake River near Twin Falls in 2023, and have since cost the state millions to suppress as they have the potential to outcompete other aquatic species and clog agricultural and energy infrastructure.
Quagga mussel elimination efforts have also killed thousands of native fish in the Snake River, including at least 48 white sturgeon, some of which were up to 35 years old and eight feet long, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

“Stopping at watercraft inspection stations and following the simple steps of cleaning, draining, and drying your watercraft are essential to ensuring Idaho’s waters thrive for generations to come,” department director Chanel Tewalt said in a press release. “It is up to all of us — boaters, anglers, and outdoor enthusiasts — to take responsibility in safeguarding our waters from invasive species.” 
 How to prevent the spread of invasive species in Idaho waterways

Idaho law requires all out-of-state watercraft to be inspected and decontaminated at a watercraft inspection station prior to launch.
When entering Idaho, boat owners should look for road signage and electronic message boards directing them to inspection stations. Before launching a watercraft in Idaho, nonresident owners must also purchase an invasive species sticker. 
Before transporting any watercraft, Idaho law requires operators to remove the drain plug and drain all water, including from internal compartments such as ballasts, bilges, live wells, and motors. All bilge and ballast plugs and other barriers that prevent water drainage must be removed and remain open while a watercraft is transported by land within the state.
To prevent the spread of invasive species, watercraft owners can follow these steps: 

Clean all equipment before leaving any waterbody, removing visible plants and animals.
Drain water from all compartments, including motors, live wells and boats. Pull the boat’s bilge plug and allow water to drain. 
Dry all equipment thoroughly before using the watercraft in a different waterbody.

In 2024, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Invasive Species Program performed nearly 157,000 watercraft inspections — a 44% increase from 2023. Throughout the history of the program, Idaho stations have performed over one million inspections.

(Getty Images)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
Senators move prior authorization, PBM regulations

But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.










There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder


“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Cave City was quiet last week.
The day after a high-end EF-3 tornado ripped through the small Sharp County town with 165-mile-per-hour winds on March 14, the main stretch had been abuzz with volunteers, heavy machinery and people sifting through what remained of their homes, businesses and storage units.
Fifteen tornadoes touched down in Arkansas during the March 14-15 severe weather event, according to the National Weather Service. Three people were killed in neighboring Independence County by the same tornado that devastated Cave City. That tornado was also the longest-tracked tornado in Arkansas since 2008, according to the weather service, remaining on the ground for over 80 miles — something the service noted as being “exceptionally rare” for a tornado in Arkansas.
Fast forward a week and a half, and the atmosphere in town has changed. Power lines no longer litter the sidewalk on one side of Main Street. People weren’t slowing in their cars, gawking and taking videos on their phones as they drove past the destruction. Cell service had been restored, even if it was somewhat spotty.
The cleanup had made remarkable progress, even after a week that began with a tornado and continued with whipping winds and fires that burned homes in an already-devastated area. 
The remains of the town’s pharmacy — totalled by the tornado — are gone. Only a concrete pad and a small pile of rubble remain. The church and the grocery store are surrounded by fences, their roofs covered with tarps and sheet metal to keep out future rain. An excavator began tearing into a brick house next door to the grocery store, pulling down what remained of its roof.
Other than people operating heavy machinery — clearing debris and trees — not many people were walking around.
Irma Carrigan, who runs the Crystal River Cave Tours and Motel, said the day after the storm that she wasn’t convinced the hordes of volunteers and support that arrived in town after the storm would last. But on Wednesday, a week and a half after the tornado that totaled her car and pulled down a massive tree in her yard, crushing one of the many small buildings on her property, Carrigan said she’d been pleasantly surprised by just how much people wanted to help, noting that she hadn’t heard one complaint from those who had arrived to offer assistance.
“It has all been very positive, very caring people,” Carrington said. “They set up food centers for different places. We didn’t have to cook during all of that.”
“The volunteerism is just phenomenal,” Carrington said. Still, sometimes it could be overwhelming, she noted, being asked by volunteers how to help when those impacted themselves still weren’t sure.
“You just look ignorant to them because you’re just saying, ‘I don’t know,’” Carrington said.
The waves of volunteers ebbed about five days after the storm, Carrigan reported, but she was grateful for the help she got. A nonprofit brought in a crane, cut up the huge tree into chunks, and helped haul it onto a family friend’s truck. Some roofers reattached a part from her roof that had blown off in the storm.
Still, other things have been slow coming. Carrigan said that as of Wednesday, they were still being told they had to boil their water. Their internet only returned two days prior, and cell service wasn’t always reliable.
In the aftermath of the storm, sleep was sometimes hard to come by.
“Your brain won’t turn off,” Carrigan said. “I think mentally, you can’t shut it off. You’re still thinking, ‘What am I going to be doing tomorrow? What can I do?’ You just continue to pray that you’ll get guidance and where you need to go next.”
Walking down one of the roads that branched off from Main Street, Carrigan pointed to her neighbors’ houses. The white, two-story, former boarding house next to hers was the oldest in town, she said, and one of its occupants was on hospice. It was badly damaged.
Next door to it was a smaller house, the back of it torn open. Those neighbors, Carrigan said, were trapped under the rubble of their home for hours after the tornado hit. One of them was over 90 years old. She said she’d heard that the property had already been sold to someone else.
The yellow house even farther down was occupied by another elderly neighbor in their 90s, Carrigan reported. They planned to repair the damage, she’d heard.
Another neighbor will tear down and put in a mobile home, Carrigan said. Yet another told Carrigan they were considering a modular home.
“He said, ‘I’m too old to build. I’m too old to rebuild,’” Carrigan said of the neighbor who was considering a mobile home. “And he said, ‘I want something; I don’t want to wait two or three years to get it.’”
Some people were scared to even clean their windows until their insurance appraisers showed up, Carrigan said, leaving some in a state of limbo.
Carrigan expressed support for a federal disaster declaration, which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders requested last week. Sander asked for additional federal help over the weekend.
“I would think they would,” Carrigan said of the federal government helping with disaster recovery. “I mean, I can’t imagine a disaster any worse.”
However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which normally manages federal disaster responses, is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration as one of its targets to be shut down, with the Washington Post reporting that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressed support for removing FEMA’s role in recovering from disasters by October. 
It’s unclear how such an action would impact a federal disaster response in Arkansas if the declaration is approved. Stateline reported last month that disaster experts and states have said that they aren’t able to take on the role FEMA currently fills.
Carrigan wasn’t the only one who would like to see the disaster declaration approved. Brandi Schulz, the executive director of the Cave City Area Chamber of Commerce, said the money that would be available to both businesses and residents would help with the recovery.
“From a chamber director perspective, I know that (a federal disaster declaration) would open up some options for our businesses that were impacted,” Schulz said. “I know that there were going to be more options, supplemental options, outside of insurance if that does go through, so in that regard, I am hoping that we can get more assistance to our businesses and also to our residents.”
Schulz described Cave City as a “very DIY community,” and said that it, combined with the support of volunteers and donors, meant that the city would likely be in “a very good place” on debris removal within the next week. Roughly 59 people have been displaced by the tornado in the area, Schulz estimated.
Taking care of the physical needs of those who were affected doesn’t just mean helping clear debris, however. Schulz said the wife of the town’s fire chief, whom the chamber director said “specializes in trauma debriefing,” has been offering resources for the community.
“I think the biggest thing is people knowing that they’re not alone, that we’re here for them,” Schulz said. “And I think we’ve shown that in the last week or so.”
Carrigan expressed some frustration with communication from state and local authorities, even as she said she appreciated what they were doing and was satisfied with the rate at which cleanup and recovery had been happening. She heard that state money was available to those impacted to help with storm recovery, but wasn’t able to figure out how to apply. She said the Red Cross opened a shelter, only to close it 48 hours later.
“I went up to the Assembly of God to check out, try to find this Red Cross and they said, ‘Well, they were here, but nobody came up here to use their services,’” Carrigan said. “And I said, ‘Well, honey, nobody knew that they were here.’”
Schulz said local officials made efforts to reach people who weren’t able to get online information, at one point distributing fliers, she said. 
The Red Cross confirmed it closed the shelter due to lack of use.
“We had some families that expressed interest, and then had found other places to say,” Red Cross regional spokesperson Sharon Watson said, adding that they had been coordinating with local faith leaders and town officials to get the word out. “Some had requested hotels, and we didn’t have hotel vouchers to offer because we had a shelter set up, and our shelter was available so therefore they opted to find other places to stay, which we completely understand.”
Watson noted that the shelter wasn’t the only way it was helping the community. On Thursday, the Red Cross opened several “Multi-Agency Resource Centers” in conjunction with the Arkansas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster for those affected by the tornado outbreak, designed to serve as a “one-stop shop” for residents to get answers from state and local authorities about disaster assistance. 
The MARCs were open from Thursday to Sunday in different cities — Diaz on Thursday, Cave City on Friday, Melbourne on Saturday, and Pocahontas on Sunday. 
Meanwhile, management of volunteers and donations was handed over to Eight Days of Hope, a Christian nonprofit, after being managed by local officials such as Schulz. 
Gale Manning, the rapid response manager for the Cave City relief efforts, said the organization will be on the ground until April 5. Volunteers have been helping cut up and haul off trees, he said, to help make the area safer. He said roughly 70 to 80 people had been volunteering on the weekdays, with volunteers coming from as far away as Alaska.
“They’re devastated,” Manning said of the people who had been impacted by the storm. “They’ve lost their life savings, belongings. But, you know, as the days go on, they feel a bit better. Again, we share the gospel and we let them know that God’s in control and that he knows what’s going on, and he promised us all a better day.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5054-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It feels like Oklahoma officials have lost touch with reality and think President Donald Trump must be the biggest idiot on the planet.
Because why else would they be first in line in trying to snooker the Trump administration into giving a state that has some of the worst education outcomes in the entire country essentially carte blanche power to decide how hundreds of millions of federal dollars should be spent in our schools?
Last week, our state superintendent and some Republican legislative leaders urged Trump’s administration to bypass the U.S. Department of Education’s traditional funding pathways and give federal dollars directly to the state so that Oklahoma’s Education Department can categorize schools “into types based on need” and offer a “diverse marketplace of solutions.”
Our leaders stupidly argue that federal officials tie too many administrative and bureaucratic strings to that funding. Those “strings” are used to ensure compliance with pesky things like our children’s civil rights.
In a video posted to X, Superintendent Ryan Walters said that having direct access to the funding will ensure more money gets into the classroom and to teachers and improve academic outcomes and results, instead of being tied up in administrative costs.
“This will forever change education. It will forever empower states and give states the ability to truly empower parents,” Walters said.
If this happens, it will forever change Oklahoma education, but I suspect it won’t be for the better.
Our lawmakers and Walters haven’t proven yet that they deserve this enormous amount of trust. It seems like a terrible idea to give them unchecked powers to determine winners and losers in our already struggling school system. Why on earth would we want to enable them to underfund certain rural and urban schools, increase funding to private schools, undercut services offered to impoverished or tribal students, or demolish programs that serve special education or English learners?
Walters pledged that he’d continue supporting disabled students, but made no guarantees about protecting anyone else. We don’t know how our leaders would spend the money differently in a way that bolsters math and reading literacy rates.
Recent nationwide tests showed that only 23% of fourth graders and 20% of eighth graders were proficient in reading. Only 31% of fourth graders and 17% of eighth graders were proficient in math.
Without cheating, that needle stubbornly refuses to move under our Legislature, which has wisely zeroed in on improving academic outcomes while somehow simultaneously managing to demonstrate their overall lack of understanding of how learning happens.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a statement that “Oklahomans are best-equipped to determine what education should look like for our students.”
I’d like to know why he believes we’re suddenly best equipped to oversee hundreds of millions in additional dollars.
Perhaps it is because we’re bottom 10 in reading and math proficiency. Or is it because the private school tax credit program lawmakers are wasting our money on is serving an outsized number of rich families? Is it because Republicans are unveiling increasingly bizarre schemes amid growing public pressure to improve academic performance? Or maybe it is because GOP lawmakers are apparently so bad at state budgeting that they’ve padded the existing state Department of Education budget so much that Walters was emboldened to buy Bibles and give his employees $600,000 in raises, including a $45,000 payout to the agency’s chief adviser.
Meanwhile, because we can’t get enough qualified educators in our classrooms, lawmakers are looking to remove a requirement that our early childhood educators have a college degree. Even though that strategy has not measurably improved performance in the upper grades, they want to allow those without a formal education to teach our youngest students the building blocks of reading and math. Yikes. Maybe instead of lowering the standards of who we allow in our classrooms, we should just acknowledge teaching is hard and make sure we’re paying a wage that makes qualified people want to teach.
State leaders are still pointing the finger at each other for last year’s insane effort to bamboozle Oklahomans into thinking our children’s academic prowess had dramatically increased under Walters’ tutelage. In reality, our leaders secretly lowered the bar students must meet to be proficient and didn’t tell anyone — until Oklahoma Voice uncovered it. Even then Walters ignored the fiasco for months.
And for a state that likes to lament overtesting, our legislators sure are proud of mandating an unnecessary exit exam. Starting this year, Oklahoma students must complete the U.S. Naturalization Test in order to graduate. It’s just one more unnecessary hurdle that could prevent someone from graduating and distracts from our real struggles.
Frankly, none of that gives me a lot of confidence that Oklahoma’s government would know how to spend federal dollars for policies and initiatives that would ensure that our schools and students are achieving their maximum potential.
If anything, our leaders should be begging Trump’s federal government to increase its scrutiny of our school system or perhaps fund increased teacher and school support staff wages.
Because only states that meet the highest academic outcomes should be given the flexibility to control their own fate.

New Jersey is among the states considering bills that would force fossil fuel companies to pay recovery costs for climate disasters. (Photo by Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Courtesy of Barbara Perez)OMAHA — Mele Mason recalls the days when the newsroom at Omaha TV station KMTV had journalists covering city hall, the county courthouse, the statehouse and the “cop shop.”
Reporters attended multiple other governmental meetings and community gatherings, said Mason, who worked as a news videographer at the station in the 1980s.
But those days are gone, she said, with her old newsroom now about one-third the size.
So when Mason saw that an effort was underway to address shrinking newsrooms by enlisting local residents to document actions taken at government meetings, she signed up.
“It just has been frustrating to see the lack of information that’s coming out. Coverage has gone way down. They don’t have the usual beat reporters,” Mason said.
Today, she is among about 60 people in the Omaha area who have undergone training to become “Documenters” at local government meetings, by taking notes and passing them onto editors for publication.
“I wanted to do something for the community,” Mason said. “I think it’s important that people have access to what happens at public meetings.”
Finding reporters in new places

That is one of the example of how news outlets increasingly look to ordinary folks to help them cover news events. This comes as there are fewer reporters and fewer applicants for reporting jobs, particularly in rural areas.
At Nebraska’s community newspapers, would-be citizen reporters are taking an online training course called “Earn Your Press Pass” to learn how to cover meetings. Other papers rely more on retirees, freelancers and “sports moms” to help.
At the Sidney Sun-Telegraph, Barbara Perez took the Press Pass course after being promoted from advertising manager to editor-publisher. She didn’t have any formal training as a reporter, so the Press Pass program — which she now requires of every new hire on staff — got her up to speed on issues like open meetings laws, public records and newspaper style.
“It’s especially helpful when you’re not hiring classically trained journalists,” said Perez from her office in western Nebraska. “We can’t just print anything, like the hearsay you see on social media.”
Getting creative
At the West Point News, editor Mike O’Brien lured a former news editor, Willis Mahannah, out of retirement to cover city council and county board meetings after losing a news reporter and being unable to fill the vacancy. To help cover the communities of Beemer and Bancroft, O’Brien relies on “contacts” in those towns to provide tips and stories.

“We had three full-time reporters, but now we’re down to me as the lone reporter,” O’Brien said. “Papers are finding it harder and harder to have a full staff, so definitely we’re relying more on contributions to the community.”
A recent study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that there were 565 full-time reporters at print and broadcast outlets in the state.
While there was no past data to compare with the number of journalists now, Jessica Walsh, an assistant UNL professor of journalism, said there’s no doubt the number has declined.
Her effort to map and track local reporting in Nebraska found at least nine counties with no local reporting outlet and 16 county seats that had no local news organization.
Walsh said that when she talked to local editors and station managers, she was struck by the strong sense of dedication to providing local news.
But they also told her how hard it has become to hire trained journalists, particularly in rural areas.
Different era


Mapping Nebraska journalism
Part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln report on journalists in the state included developing an interactive “map” of where reporters are located.
Jessica Walsh, the UNL professor who headed up the study, said it provides an instant look at where “news deserts” are located in the state, and where they aren’t.
Fifty-five of the state’s 93 counties in the state, the study found, have two or fewer full-time local journalists.
Walsh said the map shows the “areas of concern” for news coverage, since studies have show that civic engagement declines in areas with no coverage.
She said she hopes her work makes Nebraskans “more appreciative of their local journalist(s)” and inspires those who don’t subscribe to the local newspaper, to do so.


The result is that the remaining journalists often cover multiple towns or beats. One recent ad for an editor/reporter in central Nebraska sought someone to cover eight communities.
“When I look at this report, I don’t see that everything is horrible and there’s no hope,” Walsh said. “On the people level, there’s a lot of dedicated local journalists, covering meetings and sports at night. They’re really part of the community.”
She said she “was encouraged by all the people still working in local journalism despite the challenges.”
“They’re just really spread thin,” Walsh said.
One way local newspapers are addressing the shortage of reporters is by enlisting non-journalists to help out, said Dennis Derossett, the executive director of the Nebraska Press Association.
While many small-town papers traditionally had their “chicken dinner” correspondents, DeRossett said that the goal of the Press Pass program is to train someone to cover “true news events” and happenings in a community.
New training
The Press Pass program was created by Joey and Lindsey Young, who saw how difficult it was for western Kansas newspapers – including the three they own – to recruit college journalism grads to rural areas.
Joey Young, who served as president of the Kansas Press Association, said his wife used her background as a teacher to develop the online program. It covers topics like interviewing skills, covering meetings, writing in newspaper style and journalism ethics.
Hundreds of prospective journalists across the country have taken the course, Young said, with several advancing from correspondents or part-time reporters to full-time jobs.
“Community newspapers have to adapt. The traditional pipeline of journalists fresh out of college working in rural community newsrooms isn’t there anymore,” he said. “I think newspapers have an opportunity to pivot to this model in training interested community members into becoming good reporters.”
Documenters is a national program now active in 27 U.S. cities that seeks to train people to attend under-reported meetings and take notes – notes that can later be turned into reports on what happened.
The Nebraska program, based in Omaha, is run through the Nebraska Journalism Trust, which also operates the online news outlet, the Flatwater Free Press.
Documenting meetings
About 60 Documenters have taken the training since the Nebraska program was revived last summer, said Leah Keinama, director of civic journalism for the Trust.


Nebraska Documenters
For more information about the Nebraska Documenters program, access the website, flatwaterfreepress.org/documenters/
Earn Your Press Pass information can be obtained on the website, www.earnyourpresspass.com


About 10 of those graduates consistently cover meetings in the Omaha area, from the Omaha School Board and Omaha City Council, to the Douglas County Board and Westside School Board.
The program is seeking to expand into Nebraska’s Panhandle, to document meetings in a rural area over the next couple of months, Keinama said.
Documenters are paid $16 an hour, with a minimum of three hours paid to attend a meeting, take notes and turn them over to Keinama, who edits the notes into reports posted on the Flatwater website.
“What we want them to do is produce very objective notes of what happened,” she said. “So that if someone wasn’t at this meeting, they would understand what happened.”
Keinama said she feels that the Documenters notes offer more detail and are often more objective than the official meeting minutes generated and posted by a clerk of a government board.
The reports generated by the Documenters, besides providing accountability, can be used by full-time journalists to generate more detailed stories, she said.
The work also serves to give people a taste of what it’s like to be a reporter, Keinama, perhaps leading someone to pursue a job as a journalist.
“It’s really important for people to know that they have a place in citizen journalism and the civic process and that you don’t need special credentials or special exposure,” she said.
Leaning on viewers
Nebraska TV and radio stations have nothing akin to Documenters or Earn Your Press Pass to train regular citizens to become reporters, but they are relying more and more on video and photographs submitted by citizens, according to Jim Timm, president and executive director of the Nebraska Broadcasters Association.
The recent blizzard, Timm said, was a good example, with people sending in images of damage. Accidents and fires are other examples, he said.
Mason is well acquainted with the news landscape. Besides being a former video journalist at TV stations in Omaha and Seattle, she has her own freelance video outlet, Mason Video in Omaha.
Her firm is regularly hired by NBC, CNN, Fox and ESPN to provide video of Omaha — and Nebraska-area events. Recent live feeds included an interview with former astronaut Clayton Anderson and video from the tumultuous town hall held by U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb.
She said she was impressed by the quality of the Documenters training. Mason said she realizes that traditional news outlets don’t have the staff anymore to cover all the government meetings, but the work is important.
“It’s kind of scary that all these things could go on without anyone knowing what is going on in their government and their city,” she said.

Hundreds gathered on the lawn of the Capitol for around two hours Sunday for a rally featuring speakers, dance breaks and performances by local drag queens.
Transgender Day of Visibility is celebrated internationally every year on March 31 after Michigan resident Rachel Crandall-Crocker founded the holiday in 2009 to create a day focused on the happiness of the transgender and nonbinary communities.
Emme Zanotti, senior director of movement building and political affairs for Equality Michigan, said during the rally that “Trans Day of Visibility certifies that we are here and solidifies that we are to be seen as living, breathing human beings” rather than “just accepting that who we are as human beings is to be hidden, cast aside or kept a deep, dark secret.”

While Trans Unity Coalition founder Bree Taylor said the current political climate is challenging, and transgender people have a right to feel hurt, she said it is important to “find moments of celebration in the midst of adversity and to keep showing up with that joy.”
“When we decide to exist proudly in the public eye, we disrupt every storyline that says we can only be ashamed of ourselves or invisible,” Taylor said.
Audra Wilson, who represents the transgender community on Michigan’s LGBTQ+ Commission, said events like the rally provide a safe space for people to find a sense of belonging with other members of the community and allies.
“This is somewhere where, even though we’re out in public, people get to be themselves. People get to feel safe. People get to be seen and be visible,” Wilson said.

But creating a sense of community is just as important for people who may not be as comfortable sharing their identity publicly, Crossroads founder Grace Bacon said, encouraging the crowd to host small gatherings and be intentional about forming friendships.
“We have to ferret out the people who are scared to come out, give them a place to be, a time to be, so that they can be themselves for a little while,” Bacon said.
Roz Keith, the founder of Stand with Trans, said that her goal when her son came out as transgender was to ensure that he felt supported and safe in his identity.
“What I learned through this journey is that being transgender is not about changing who you are, it’s about becoming who you have always been,” Keith said.

Taylor compared people’s gender identities to their religion.
“It’s something that can’t be casually changed because someone else disapproves,” Taylor said. “It is foundational to who we are, just like any belief that forms the very core of our own existence.”
But while Zanotti said celebrating trans joy has been meaningful, she added that it’s just the first step towards true acceptance.
“If these next generations are simply visible, it will not be enough,” Zanotti said. “It will now be our mission and our responsibility to make sure that transgender people are not just seen, but to make sure we are heard, and to make damn sure that we are understood.”

(Rick Kern | Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.











If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front

	
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home

	
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Shaundelle Brooks’ bill that would criminalize knowingly giving firearms to someone who recently received inpatient mental health treatment. 
Brooks named the bill “Akilah’s Law” in honor of her son Akilah Dasilva, who was one of four killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018.
Brooks, a Democrat, has been lobbying for tighter gun restrictions ever since, and won her seat in the House in November after running on a platform of gun safety advocacy. This is her first session as part of the Tennessee General Assembly.
“Akilah was born here in Nashville, and his life was taken here in Nashville … my son Akilah would still be here with us today if the parents of the perpetrator had followed the instructions of law enforcement, the judicial system and medical professionals who deemed their son unfit to possess a firearm,” Brooks said Wednesday. 
“Despite being instructed by each of these oversight agencies to store their firearms safely and not return them to the shooter, the parents knowingly and intentionally disregarded those instructions, broke the law and (were) subsequently held accountable because they resided in another state,” she said.
The House Criminal Justice Subcommittee voted 6-2 to advance the bill to the House’s full Judiciary Committee. The bill still faces several hurdles before it can become law.
Brooks said the bill is focused on “upholding the law and holding those who break the law accountable.”
Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in February 2022 for killing four people and injuring four others at the restaurant with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Illinois State Police had revoked Reinking’s firearm owner’s identification card prior to the shooting, requiring Reinking to surrender his guns to his father, Jeffrey Reinking.
Jeffrey Reinking returned the guns to his son, including the assault rifle used in the Waffle House shooting — an act that is illegal in the state of Illinois. The elder Reinking was sentenced to 18 months in prison in Illinois in March 2023.
Prosecutor: No punishment for shooter’s father under Tennessee law
Aldane Dasilva, Brooks’ son, was 12 when his brother Akilah was killed. For years, his family pursued accountability in court. 
“The law did not fail us,” Dasilva said. “It held both parties accountable: the father of the person that took my brother from me was held accountable using the same statute — the bill presented here today — by the courts of Illinois, because he broke the law.”
Tennessee had no such pathway for recourse.
In Tennessee, giving firearms to juveniles or people who are intoxicated are misdemeanor crimes. But Tennessee currently has no law against giving firearms to someone who has been committed for mental health evaluation. 
Nashville Assistant District Attorney Jan Norman was one of the prosecutors who prosecuted Travis Reinking for the Waffle House homicides. She testified Wednesday that she remembers talking with Brooks about the Illinois law.
“We were talking about that law and what the punishment was, and I said to her these words: ‘Shaundelle, it’s not enough. It’s not. The punishment is not enough. But thank God he gave him those guns in Illinois, because if that would have happened here in Tennessee, I couldn’t have done a thing about it. He wouldn’t have been punished at all if it happened in Tennessee,’” Norman said.

Brooks’ bill would criminalize the sale, offer of sale, delivery or transfer of a firearm to a person while knowing that the person has been a patient of a mental health institution – voluntarily or involuntarily – within the previous five years. It does not apply to people who were voluntarily admitted for treatment solely for alcohol abuse disorder who have no other secondary mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders.
Nashville-area psychiatrist Eric Zabriskie also testified in favor of the bill. He said firearms were the method used in 67% of the 1,245 deaths by suicide recorded in Tennessee in 2022. 
“If we continue to do nothing and take no preventative public mental health measures such as this bill, fewer (people) will make it back into (mental health) treatment, and more will go to the morgue and into the ground instead,” Zabriskie said.
Bill moves forward as Nashville remembers school shootings
Wednesday’s committee meeting fell during a time of remembrance and mourning in Nashville.
Thursday marked the second anniversary of a shooting at The Covenant School that killed 9-year-old students Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus, and William Kinney as well as school headmaster Katherine Koonce, custodian Mike Hill, and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak.
Amid the public outcry for gun law reforms that followed, a 2023 special legislative session of the Tennessee General Assembly called by Gov. Bill Lee ended without the passage of any bills restricting access to guns.
On Tuesday, the Metro Nashville Public Schools Board of Education honored Antioch High School staff for their actions during a January shooting. Solomon Henderson, 17, opened fire in the school’s cafeteria, killing 16-year-old Dayana Escalante and injuring another student before taking his own life.
James Shaw Jr., who wrestled the gun away from Travis Reinking and sustained injuries in the Waffle House shooting, also testified Wednesday in favor of Brooks’ bill.
3 kids, 3 adults killed in shooting at Nashville private elementary school

“I’ve just seen the outcome of (a mass shooting), and I’ve seen how it could fracture families. I’ve seen the holes it could make. I could see how the mending doesn’t happen. And, as well, I’ve seen myself the diagnoses that I’ve had, of having PTSD and having things of that nature,” Shaw said. 
“I think it’s a step in the right way for some of the other mothers that are here from (Covenant) and from Antioch and from the other shootings that we’ve had recently here in Nashville,” he continued. “I think this is a step in the right way, so I’m very supportive of her bill, and I think it will help Nashville push forward and for us to just make laws, good laws, about gun safety and practice.”
Reps. Andrew Farmer (R-Sevierville), William Lamberth (R-Portland)), Lowell Russell (R-Vonore), Rick Scarbrough (R-Oak Ridge), Jason Powell (D-Nashville) and Gabby Salinas (D-Memphis) voted in favor of advancing the bill.
Representatives Fred Atchley (R-Sevierville) and Clay Doggett (R-Pulaski) voted in opposition.

(Justin Paget | Getty Images)West Virginia spent nearly $70 million paying to house foster children in out-of-state facilities last year because the state doesn’t have the capacity to keep children close to home. The astronomical price tag includes housing, feeding, medicating and educating hundreds of youth in foster care.
The Department of Human Services paid the bulk of the price tag. Angelia Hightower, a spokesperson for the department, said that some children were removed from out-of-state programs “due to safety concerns and educational deficiencies.”
The state continues to make payments to Devereux Behavioral Health, which operates in 11 states, despite five open West Virginia investigations against the facilities involving sexual abuse and neglect. While the company is facing multiple lawsuits over child abuse allegations, the state still has children living in Devereux facilities. The most recent payment of $5,015 was in late February, according to the state auditor’s public records.
The West Virginia Department of Education, which pays for some out-of-state education for foster children, said that every out-of-state facility had some level of findings of noncompliance that are often noted under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during fiscal year 2024. 
“No egregious findings were noted,” said Christy Day, a spokesperson for the WVDE. “There were no findings that warranted removal of students.
Devereux was last monitored in 2018, she said. “Any educational findings/violations found at that time were corrected within one year in compliance with the U.S. Department of Education,” she said. 
Keeping children in West Virginia would be much cheaper, experts say, and allow better oversight of their treatment. But with a shortage of foster homes and in-state treatment beds, West Virginia relies on out-of-state facilities to house children, typically teens with behavioral or mental health issues. 
In 2024, Neveya (West Virginia Watch is not fully identifying her to protect her privacy) ended up in Laurel Oaks in Alabama, a residential treatment facility 706 miles from Charleston. The atmosphere was chaotic, she said. 
“I hated it there. Like every other day, there was a fight, every other day there was something,” said Neveya, 18. “I also had an issue with a girl there, and she peed on my stuff.”
Nevaya, who spent her childhood living under a bridge with her mother, had been in a facility in Charleston and attending public school. In 2024, a Child Protective Services worker put Nevaya on a flight to Alabama. Nevaya said she was given no warning but was told that the Charleston facility couldn’t support her mental health needs.
School was offered on-site at Laurel Oaks, but Navaya said her education during her five months there was minimal.
“If they had a fight on the floor that day, school’s canceled,” Neveya said. “I don’t mean to speak too harshly of it, but it’s almost like prison in a way.”
DoHS has asked lawmakers, who are right now vetting state budget requests, for a 65% increase in funding for foster care.
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, is a foster parent who has spearheaded legislation he hopes will reform the state’s troubled foster care system. He reiterated that the state doesn’t have enough in-state beds that can offer the kind of behavioral or mental health support these kids need.
“Right now is a really tough time. I know [DoHS] is aware of the problem, and they want to make this a focus. We all as a state and as a community should want to make this a focus,” Burkhammer said. 
“The ultimate goal is to get them back home, and the best case scenario would be with their family,” he continued. “These are our kids, our responsibility. We should do everything we can to get them home.”’

Court orders child out of state, agencies on hook to pay
The number of children coming into West Virginia’s foster care accelerated as the substance abuse crisis ravaged the state. The lack of available homes and beds in group homes has led to children being placed in hotel rooms and on campgrounds.
There are more than 5,800 children in state foster care. DoHS data shows that 471 are out of state, mostly in group residential care. 
By combing through the state auditor’s public data on spending, West Virginia Watch was able to track payments — a mix of federal and state dollars — to more than a dozen out-of-state facilities in FY 2024. WVDE paid more than $7 million for these facilities, according to the auditor’s records. 
Facilities were located in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and more. One spending record showed the state paid Grafton School Residential Treatment in Virginia $687,908 last year.
Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia, estimated that the state spends three times the amount of money on sending foster children out of state than it does on the ones who remain in state. His organization sued the state over alleged mistreatment of foster children, including sending them to dangerous out-of-state group homes. 
“Once they are sent out of state, they experience extreme trauma they will never recover from,” Folio said. 
Whitney Wetzel, a former DoHS spokesperson who is no longer with the agency, told West Virginia Watch in December that DoHS seeks to use out-of-state placements only when in-state services at the required level of care are unavailable. “Typically, these placements involve more intense or specialized services, which leads to increased costs,” she said.
The process for a child being sent out of state involves numerous stakeholders, and ultimately, the court makes the decision to send a child to an out-of-state facility, according to DoHS. 
“It’s important to emphasize that DoHS is one member of this selection team that recommends placements based on the child’s needs. DoHS is, however, the primary funding source and required to cover costs of court-ordered placements, even if they differ from a DoHS recommendation,” Wetzel said in an email to West Virginia Watch. 
Potential facilities to take children go through a vetting process, according to Hightower. It includes an on-site visit. Annual reviews are conducted at facilities with existing contracts to ensure compliance. 
“Social workers continue to meet the required monthly visit standards for all facilities,” Hightower said.
DoHS covers out-of-state education expenses for children who do not have an Individualized Education Program (IEP). 
The WVDE, obligated to pay for children’s education in out-of-state facilities, was invoiced for educational services for approximately 535 students in FY 2024, according to Day. Some students were listed twice due to being in multiple facilities.
The department handles the educational monitoring of these places, Day said. 
Neveya said school at Laurel Oaks was online, with an adult who was on-site to supervise if they had school for the day. There was no teacher on campus during her five months there.
“Schooling was hard. It didn’t give me much information,” she said.
Jeanette Jackson, chief executive officer for Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Center, said any allegation at the center is thoroughly investigated. 
“Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Hospital is committed to providing compassionate care in a safe setting to children and adolescents with psychiatric, emotional and behavioral disorders,” she wrote in an email.

Cost rising to send foster children out of state 
DoHS said they’d reduced the percentage of children in residential care from 24% to 14% over the last several years. Wetzel said they’ve tripled their spending on community-based mental health services.
A recent investigation from Mountain State Spotlight, a nonprofit newsroom, found that the state still sends children with physical or emotional disabilities to group homes and treatment centers at a rate three times the national average.
DoHS leaders recently requested more than $181 million for the foster care program in the department’s roughly $7 billion total budget request for FY 2026. It’s a 65% increase over the $110 million in the current DoHS budget for foster care.
Alex Mayer, new DoHS cabinet secretary, told lawmakers that the rising costs of out-of-state services are a budgetary risk.
“ … The limited in-state capacity and increased level of acuity among youth has also led to higher costs for out-of-state placements,” Mayer told the Senate Finance Committee on March 20. He has stressed that he is committed to working collaboratively with the Legislature to address child welfare issues. 
The state draws down federal money to help pay for children out of state. Burkhammer said federal reimbursement rates for out-of-state placements are part of the price problem.
“There could be a potential savings if we can bring those kids home and take care of them at home,” Burkhammer said.
Folio called on lawmakers to study how much the state is spending sending children out of state and, in response, invest those resources in community-based programs to keep children close to home.  
“The taxpayers will save millions of dollars,” he said. 
In February, Neveya was in Charleston, getting ready for a formal event at a nearby high school, excited to wear a long ruby red gown.
The teenager is back home in West Virginia after aging out of state care. She is living with a foster family who kept in contact with her when she was sent to Alabama. After years of poor education in facilities, they’re helping her get caught up on schooling so she can graduate.
She credits her new family and a therapist for helping her make it to this point. 
When asked what she’d tell the state foster care leaders, she replied, “I would want them to know that they need to have better facilities, because it sucked.”

Prior to the pandemic, Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was consistently around 3.0%, ranging from 2.8% to 3.2%.
Nebraska’s preliminary unemployment rate still remains among the lowest nationally, tying for fifth lowest in the recently released data that reflects February. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February is 4.1%, up from 3.9% a year earlier.
Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said the uptick appears to be driven by an increase in the state labor force.
“When someone enters the labor force and begins searching for work, they are classified as unemployed until they find a job,” she said. “Both new entrants and re-entrants into the labor force were up in February, and Nebraska’s labor force is now at an all-time high of 1,077,890 participants.”
The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Both individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses. 
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
The number of filled nonfarm jobs was 1,048,487 in February, up 6,569 over a year earlier. Private industries with the most growth over the past year were private education and health services (up 5,889 jobs) and mining and construction (up 1,803 jobs).

Minneapolis on Thursday has become the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.

The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
Colorado joins lawsuit alleging property management company illegally fixes rent prices

“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote.
Colorado’s House approved a similar bill last week, and it’s now headed to the Senate. House Bill 25-1004, introduced on the first day of the state’s legislative session, would regulate rent-setting computer algorithms. A report from 2024 that has since been removed from the White House website found that Denver renters who live in buildings that rely on such algorithms pay an average of $136 more per month.
Landlords resist
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. Those attorneys general include Colorado’s Phil Weiser. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

Gov. Bill Lee will include $20 million in the state’s budget for victim-serving agencies that — for weeks — have issued public pleas for help to keep their doors open in the face of steep cuts to federal grants. 
Sexual assault centers, domestic violence shelters and child abuse counseling agencies — many serving key roles in working with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice — have seen their share of federal Victims of Crime Act funding dwindled from a peak of $68 million in 2018 to $16 million last year.  
In response to these cuts, 35 other states took action to provide state funding. Tennessee was not one of them, until now. 
“Some of the victim services units are struggling to provide the services that are needed, particularly for our law enforcement and for the victims of crime in our state,” Jim Bryson, commissioner of the Department of Finance and Administration, said Tuesday in presenting the supplemental budget proposal to lawmakers. 
The governor’s funding — $10 million in grants for each of the next two years — fell short of the request for $25 million in recurring state funding a coalition of state nonprofits say they need to preserve current services. 
Memphis domestic violence center abruptly closes amid statewide fight for victim funding

Advocates, disappointed when the governor’s budget initially included no state funding for crime victims, nevertheless called it an important first step but are still seeking a long-term dedicated crime victim funding.
“This funding is an important acknowledgment of the urgent crisis facing Tennessee’s victim service providers,” said Stephen Woerner, executive director of Tennessee Children’s Advocacy Centers, which provides counseling and other services to children who have suffered abuse.
Woerner stressed the need for sufficient and sustained funding long-term. 
The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA funding, relies on the fees and fines collected from individuals prosecuted in federal courts. It has seen a drastic drop in collections as prosecutors made a concerted shift to accept more plea deals — a trend that preceded the current Trump Administration.
A short-term infusion of COVID-era funding helped bridge the gap, but those funds have now ended.
Collectively, Tennessee organizations receiving VOCA grants serve more than 95,000 victims in Tennessee each year, according to the state’s Office of Criminal Justice Programs.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota health agencies are trying to adjust to the sudden loss of federal funding. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services learned last week it lost about $3.2 million in federal funding for substance-use treatment and mental health programs after block grants were rescinded by a federal agency. 
In an evening email on March 24, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration told HHS that the COVID-19 pandemic-era grants were taken back in accordance with President Donald Trump’s executive order empowering the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to cut costs.
“These grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic,” the email stated. “The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary.
The grants were scheduled to expire Sept. 30.
Pam Sagness, executive director for the Behavioral Health Division for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in 2021 the department received the five block grants to target substance abuse prevention, treatment and mental health programming totaling about $9.5 million. The funding for these grants came from the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Renae Moch, public health director for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, said the organization received $115,000 from HHS to develop plans for a 24/7, 365-day facility to focus on crisis response, mental health and addiction services, rather than treating patients in an emergency room.
“How we were notified and how this kind of went down has just been unbelievable,” Moch said.
  Renae Moch (Provided)
She said she received a general notification from HHS last Tuesday morning that their block grant funding was going to be impacted, but she was still unclear about what that meant and what funding was being rescinded. She got a call back about 4:30 p.m. from the department, 45 minutes before she was to present and hopefully award funding from the grant during a Bismarck City Commission meeting.
“I had to kind of refocus and compose myself before going up to the meeting at 5:15 p.m.,” Moch said. The presentation and contract award were pulled from the agenda.
Sagness said 42 grantees statewide will lose federal funding.
“Our focus now is on ensuring that services continue by identifying alternative funding and working with providers to minimize disruptions,” Sagness said in a statement. “It’s important for North Dakotans to know that support remains in place. Anyone struggling should continue to reach out for help, including through (calling) 988 or their local behavioral health provider.” 
The department received notice the grants were being terminated the day the funding was rescinded, Sagness said.
Holly Scott, a spokesperson for Fargo Cass Public Health, said its state partners confirmed that its funding for social detox center operations will run out after September.
“Our leadership team is currently working to determine the impacts of these changes, while also reviewing alternate sources of funding to assure long-term sustainability,” Scott said in an email.
Other organizations impacted by the loss of block grant funding:

Connect Us Therapy, Williston – $50,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Corner Post Counseling, Mandan – $30,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Public Health & Tribes, 23 contracts – $200,000 for substance-use prevention
Flint Communications, Fargo – $824,951 for Parents Lead, opioid messaging initiatives and marketing statewide
BeMoreColorful, Fargo – $160,000 for behavioral health workforce tools

“All of the planning and all of the work that has gone into it and now, here we are,” Moch said.
She said they don’t want to abandon the project, but the organization is going to have to come up with alternate funding sources.
“We will be losing months,” Moch said. She’s also hopeful a new grant or funding source can be identified before the city and county begin their budget discussions over the summer.
Agriculture research loses momentum with federal payments uncertain

Separate federal funding through the Health Equity Immunization Grant was also rescinded for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, she said. That funding impacted the organization’s ability to provide free COVID-19 tests and a portion of the salary for a vaccine specialist.
“It’s all related to the same decision,” Moch said. She added that arguments about the pandemic being over and the funding not being needed don’t hold water because they are still working through the impacts of COVID-19. That funding was supposed to continue until 2026, Moch said.
“The abrupt impacts on us at the local level is what is just so unexpected and so we’re just really trying to scramble now because there was no notice,” she said.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the COVID-19 pandemic has been over for three years, but he has been in contact with HHS to get a handle on the impacts to state health providers.
“I’m glad it happened during the legislative session so we can figure out how we readjust our budget and figure out how to finish off the session,” Armstrong said.
In a news release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was evaluating funding options for the loss in federal block grants and will collaborate with other state agencies, organizations and private partners to address priority areas. The department said it will provide updates as more information becomes available.

In this January 2024 photo, an information screen for visitors at Sauk Prairie Hospital displays a recruiting message directed at health care workers. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)As more Wisconsinites need more hospital care, the supply of health care workers to provide that care remains slim — and to change that outlook will take concerted effort, according to a new report released Monday.
“Wisconsin’s health care workforce must grow faster,” says the 2025 Wisconsin Health Care Workforce Report, produced by the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).
“Health care employers are working hard to retain current employees, re-recruit those who left for what they thought might be greener pastures and attract new talent to health care fields in Wisconsin,” the report states.
The report finds some glimmers of improvement and promising pathways for hospitals to further address their need for more trained staff. Over the last two years hospital job vacancies have fallen slightly and employment has increased.
But filling jobs remains a challenge and will remain that way for years, the report states. It suggests  a combination of strategies to overcome current trends.
Some of the strategies involve  how hospitals themselves structure jobs and hiring practices. But the report contends other sectors — government, educational institutions, and the insurance companies and government programs that pay the lion’s share of health care bills — will also need to shift their policies.
Reimbursement rates are not keeping up with increased costs as hospitals and other providers weather rising payroll and supply expenses, for example, the report finds.
By far the dominant contributor to the workforce challenges hospitals and health systems face, however, is demographic, according to the report. Wisconsinites continue to get collectively older.
“Only Wisconsin’s population over 65 has grown between the 2010 and 2020 census,” said Ann Zenk, senior vice president of workforce and clinical practice for the hospital association. The working-age population ages 18 to 65 decreased in that same period.
Those younger than 40 go to the hospital once a year on average. From ages 40 to 65 that ticks up to three times a year. After 65, “it doubles to six visits a year,” Zenk  said.
“As we age, we need more health care,” she said. “That is going to be a double challenge for hospitals because our available workers are a smaller pool and our demand is even greater.”
The population preparing to enter the workforce — people ages 19 and younger — “is not large enough to replace retiring baby boomers,” the report states. “Growing the health care workforce needed to respond to this demographic challenge will require increasing in-migration, ensuring access to career pathways and increasing interest in hospital careers.”
That starts with giving students in high school or even earlier “the opportunity to have exposure — you’re walking in the shoes of what it’s like to be a health care professional,” Zenk said.
Then there’s the education process itself — “making sure that educational pathways remain accessible,” Zenk said. The report urges policymakers not to add requirements to training programs that would make them longer, more complex or more expensive.
One promising training innovation, said Zenk, is the use of an apprenticeship program to prepare new registered nurses, pioneered in the last few years in Wisconsin by UW Health and the state Department of Workforce Development.
While the program stretches over four years for the equivalent of a two-year associate degree, she said, it also allows the participating students to “earn while you learn.” The concept is being expanded to prepare respiratory therapists.
The report also identifies generational shifts in what people expect from their jobs. Zenk said addressing demands for more flexible and family-friendly schedules can make it possible to hire and retain more successfully. But those changes may also mean demand for even more personnel.
“So where you need a roster of 10 nurses, you need 15 now to cover the exact same shift,” Zenk said.
The report also sees technology offering some relief.
Some of that might be replacing people for tasks such as registering at the front desk for a medical visit, Zenk said. But another example is monitoring equipment that could go home with a patient and be checked remotely, with nurses and clinicians visiting the patient at home every day, she observed.
Zenk said some regulations in health care can be reexamined and streamlined without endangering safety or the quality of care.
Physician assistants, for example, collaborate with and are overseen by a medical doctor. Zenk said in the past a physician could supervise no more than four PAs. That has since been relaxed, making it less burdensome for both doctor and PA alike, she said.
Zenk said another form of regulation has gotten worse, however: When health insurers interpose an increasing number of steps for them to sign off on the care a doctor or hospital provides.
“That requires staff to make those phone calls or enter that data, or requires physicians to document more and more and more to justify the care that they want to provide and that the patient needs,” she said.
She’s seen insurer-driven requirements increase in the last five years.
“That’s a major tug-of-war on clinicians’ time,” Zenk said, “and for patients also very frustrating.”
In the end, however, there’s no single silver bullet to resolve what is likely to be a persistent challenge for hospitals or their employees.
“There’s no one answer. We’re more than likely not going to be able to grow ourselves out of this one fast enough,” Zenk said. “But anything we can do to grow the workforce faster is going to help.”

“We usually will have a lot more sponsorships by now,” Fuad, communications organizer for the Providence nonprofit that empowers youth of color to fight for education justice and pursue career success, said on March 21.

Several corporate sponsors from past years have recently emailed ARISE to say they cannot help with this year’s Visibility Event on May 8 at The Guild in Pawtucket because of changing priorities in a new political climate, Fuad said. 
It’s why there is a stronger sense of urgency for ARISE and other local nonprofit organizations that work to advance social justice as they gear up for 401Gives on Tuesday, April 1. 
About 600 nonprofit organizations serving Rhode Islanders have registered for the 6th annual 401Gives, the day of online giving that takes its name from the state’s area code. About 90 participating nonprofits are led by people of color, said Nancy Wolanski, director of the Alliance for Nonprofit Impact at the United Way of Rhode Island, which organizes the annual event.
Even before President Donald Trump President Trump signed an executive order dismantling Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs on his first day back in the White House, companies were already scaling back their DEI initiatives. Corporate charitable giving may be following suit. One high-profile example: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced in February that it was ending its “social advocacy funding,” which included racial and gender equality initiatives, to focus instead on biology and AI.
“I would definitely reaffirm that there are concerns in organizations working in DEI, organizations working in racial justice, and it’s the time for us to come together as a community to really support them,” Wolanski said. “Those organizations are seeing more difficulty in fundraising, just in general, from philanthropy, and from the federal government that has closed some funding streams.”
401Gives raised over $3.8 million last year from over 16,000 donors who supported a total of 597 different Ocean State nonprofits. ARISE raised $38,806 last year, exceeding its $35,000 goal, and engaging a total of 595 donations to win the “Most Unique Donors” award for the third year in a row. 
This year, ARISE hopes to raise at least $45,000, Fuad said. Its 2025 401Gives talking points for donors will specifically highlight the organization’s work protecting civil liberties, such as testifying in favor of the Freedom to Read Act at the State House, and co-hosting “Know Your Rights” workshops around immigration, special education and bilingual education. 
Fuad said past fundraising outreach largely focused on ARISE staff sharing stories about their work, personal development and political engagement, or ARISE youth talking about their positive feelings from participating in the organization’s leadership training and advocacy programs.
For the last three years, ARISE has won a prize for peer-to-peer fundraising for small organizations — those having annual budgets between $151,000 and $500,000 — for its success in enlisting the help of alumni, staff, volunteers and the youth who participate in its programs. They send texts, promote times when matching gifts are available and share updates on group chats throughout the day. This year, youth participants working as a team have been given a goal to raise $4,000, Fuad said.
Starting at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, the first $20,000 raised during 401Gives will be matched by the Papitto Opportunity Connection. The maximum match per donor, per nonprofit, is $500. Last year, the early morning match lasted for just under two minutes. ARISE’s entire board, staff members and other supporters set their alarms to be ready to make a donation to secure matching dollars before the threshold is reached, Fuad said. 
Other matches are offered at noon and 4:01 p.m. on the first day. Online giving continues through 6 p.m. on Wednesday, April 2. The short fundraising window helps fuel “one big burst of collective energy,” Fuad said.
“It’s a really good energizer for us,” Fuad added. “We connect with our base, and it’s a reminder that this work is very community-led, that we really need individual donors to buy into our mission and buy into our work and buy into our programming.”
Likewise for Rhode Island Black Storytellers (RIBS). The Providence nonprofit dedicated to performing and sharing stories from Black history and culture in school programs and public performances has participated in 401Gives since its inception in 2020. RIBS raised $10,528 last year from a total of 118 donors, more than doubling its goal of $5,000.

Funding operations too
This year, RIBS set a goal to raise $25,000, said RIBS Executive/Festival Director and founding member Valerie Tutson. The fact that the contributions are unrestricted and can go towards general operating expenses is a big deal, she added.
“The challenge is, since our programming has grown, how do we support the operation?” Tutson said. “That’s why for us 401Gives are so important.”
Just last week, a bank’s charitable foundation delivered disappointing news to RIBS on a $25,000 grant it had applied for.
“The response to us was, ‘We have changed our funding priorities,’” Tutson said. “That was the wording that came from them.”
RIBS received a $10,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts last year to support its Funda Fest, a 10-day Black storytelling celebration every January with performances at schools and public and private venues that takes its name from the Zulu word for “to speak/learn.”
“It was kind of an entry level grant to help an organization like RIBS, which doesn’t have a full-time development person and might not have all the time and resources to navigate how a governmental grant proposal goes in,” Tutson said. “(They) eliminated that program and now all organizations have to go into the same pool.”
RIBS was founded in 1998. Before the rise of DEI, its community outreach emphasized multiculturalism and strengthening literacy education and now will continue to do so, Tutson said.
“We’ve always been the Rhode Island Black Storytellers,” Tutson said. “It’s only been the last few years that we’ve been able to say, ‘Hey, if you’re concerned about justice, then you can really support our work.’”
On its 401Gives profile page, the group says it does not just tell Black stories but wants to help others do the same. “RIBS knows it is important for Black communities to know their own history and culture, and for others to experience Black culture presented by Black people,” it reads.

Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court [&#8230;]","(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Three African American women are suing the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research in federal court, alleging they experienced racial discrimination while working for the nonpartisan state agency.
Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Little Rock civil rights attorney Austin Porter Jr. is representing all three plaintiffs.

B. Brown complaint redacted 
The BLR assists members of the General Assembly with drafting legislation, researching state policies and financial matters and codifying legislation that becomes law, among other things.
The three plaintiffs claim their non-Black superiors at the BLR, including Director Marty Garrity, failed to promote them into jobs for which they were qualified and instead hired less experienced non-Black employees, despite the plaintiffs’ positive performance evaluations. They also claim the BLR retaliated against them for complaining about the discrimination.
The jury trial in Brown’s case is scheduled to begin Oct. 6 in U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker’s courtroom. Drone-North’s case will go to trial Dec. 9 with U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky presiding.
U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. is responsible for Beal’s case, and the trial is scheduled for June 2027, according to court documents.
All three women filed complaints against the BLR with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2023. The plaintiffs claim the discrimination was based on age in addition to race, and they assert that the BLR violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects people from employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”

North complaint redacted 
The BLR, represented by the state Attorney General’s office, filed responses to each complaint in which it denied the allegations of discriminatory and retaliatory behavior.
Beal and Drone-North were fired from BLR before filing their lawsuits. The BLR’s response to Brown’s complaint in August 2024 states she was “currently an employee of BLR.”
Brown’s complaint alleges that Garrity and other BLR administrators repeatedly told her she had “not yet met the years of experience qualification” for promotions and pay increases. The BLR admitted this claim in its response but denied the allegation that non-Black employees were promoted without meeting the “years of experience” standard to which it held Brown.
The BLR repeatedly denied in its response to Drone-North’s complaint that younger, less qualified white women regularly received promotions the plaintiff sought.
The agency admitted in its response to Beal’s complaint that an employee who had worked at the BLR for less than a year received a promotion in “violation of BLR policy.” Beal’s complaint states that the other employee had been at the BLR for less than a year, the minimum amount of experience required before a promotion.

Beal complaint redacted 
The BLR also asserted in its responses that sovereign immunity nullifies the plaintiffs’ claims. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Additionally, Brown and Drone-North failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing lawsuits, according to the BLR.
Garrity declined to comment on the pending litigation Thursday when reached by email, saying she would “let the responses speak for themselves.” Megan Markham, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said in an email that the office “will continue vigorously defending the case.”
 Legislative involvement

While the BLR is a defendant in all three lawsuits, the State of Arkansas is also a defendant in Brown’s suit because the Arkansas Legislative Council’s executive subcommittee had “knowledge and willful disregard for Ms. Brown’s civil and employee rights,” her complaint states.
The executive subcommittee is responsible for overseeing appeals of investigative reports into discrimination complaints against state agencies. Brown filed a complaint against the BLR in early 2021, and the subcommittee met to discuss the issue, as reflected in both Brown’s legal complaint and the panel’s April 2021 meeting agenda.
The panel’s May 2023 agenda similarly states that it discussed a BLR “personnel matter.” Such discussions are not open to the public.
Brown and Drone-North both filed EEOC complaints in February 2023, and the BLR hired Little Rock attorney Carolyn Witherspoon to investigate, according to both women’s legal filings.
“However, rather than truly investigating the plaintiff’s complaint of discrimination, Carolyn Witherspoon looked for ways to nullify the plaintiff’s complaint,” Drone-North’s legal complaint states.
Brown claimed the BLR retaliated against her for “providing aid and agreeing to be a witness” in Drone-North’s complaint to the EEOC. Brown said the BLR used this as a reason to reprimand her; the agency denied this allegation in its response to her complaint.
The legislative subcommittee voted to affirm Witherspoon’s findings and reject the two appeals at the May 2023 meeting. The findings included that Drone-North’s EEOC complaint “did not have merit,” her legal complaint states.

Brown was mentioned by name during the public portion of the meeting before the votes, while Drone-North was not. However, the subcommittee was “concerned about the veracity and the accuracy of many statements made during the investigation” into Drone-North’s complaint, said the panel’s then-vice chairman, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs.
Drone-North was fired from the BLR the following day, while Brown “was reprimanded” and experienced “consequences” later that month, according to both legal complaints.
Four months later, the Legislative Council’s Claims Review and Litigation Reports Oversight subcommittee was tasked with approving a $15,000 mediation settlement agreement between Drone-North and the BLR over her EEOC complaint, according to documents that have since been removed from the Legislature’s website. The subcommittee’s Sept. 13, 2023, meeting was canceled, meaning there was no action for the full council to approve later that day, though the matter was listed on the council’s agenda.
Drone-North’s complaint does not mention the potential settlement.

9.13.23 Exhibit J.01 - Emergency Action ALC Claims 
Meanwhile, Garrity fired Beal in February 2024 after Beal responded negatively to Garrity reprimanding her, according to the legal complaint. Beal claimed the reprimand was retaliation after she filed her second discrimination complaint to EEOC a few months prior. She was fired a month after the death of her son, of which Garrity was aware, Beal’s legal complaint states.
All three plaintiffs request back pay, compensatory damages, attorney fees and declarations that the BLR engaged in unlawful employment practices. Beal and Drone-North seek re-employment by the BLR; Brown seeks an injunction against the BLR engaging in further discrimination, as well as a formal promotion into the BLR position for which she claims she carried out the responsibilities but did not receive the title or appropriate pay.
 Legal representation

Porter, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said the three lawsuits are unlikely to be combined into a class-action lawsuit, which consists of a group of plaintiffs claiming the same injury and representing others who are not involved in the litigation.
Porter specializes in civil rights and employment discrimination litigation. In January, he testified against the eventual Act 116 of 2025, which Republican lawmakers claimed would force public entities to prioritize “merit” over “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
“‘Merit,’ in a lot of people’s minds, means simply white,” Porter told a Senate committee.
The state’s Republican-led Legislature doesn’t seem to “have any interest” in protecting the state’s Black employees, who currently fill “a large part” of lower-level positions, Porter told the Advocate Tuesday.
In 2017, Porter represented Doris Smith in federal court when she alleged that the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration discriminated against her as a Black woman. Smith’s allegations were similar to those of the BLR complainants: she claimed the finance department failed to promote and pay her equitably to her white counterparts, retaliated against her for complaining about the apparent discrimination and fired her in 2018 after she filed a formal complaint.
A jury ruled in Smith’s favor in June 2020, awarding her $223,333.81 in back pay and $108,000 in compensatory damages. She was later reinstated as a finance department employee.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The League of Women Voters of Kentucky joined with other advocacy groups at the Capitol Rotunda on March 28 for the Democracy Principle Rally. Why? Because our representative democracy rests on a fundamental principle: We, the people, have a right to participate in decisions that affect us. 
The League of Women Voters of Kentucky has documented how Kentucky’s legislative process, since 1998, has been manipulated in ways that increasingly minimize public input, stifling full and open debate on significant legislation.
The 2025 legislative session was no exception, with numerous bills passed and sent to the governor using fast-track maneuvers and undemocratic tactics, often in combination. Legislators used combinations like these:

File a “shell bill” with minor changes to existing law and assign it to a standing committee.
Rush a bill by holding bill readings on the chamber floor before the committee even discusses and votes on the bill.
Reschedule committee meetings with short notice to the public.
In committee, introduce and vote on a substitute bill that some committee members cannot access before the meeting and the public has not seen.
Send the bill for a floor vote that same day, giving non-committee legislators and their constituents little time to review the new language.
Then, the shenanigans rinse-and-repeat in the next chamber. 
 If such strategies produce a bill different from the originating chamber, specially appointed committees can produce yet another version for a final vote before the public and many legislators have time to review.

These strategies not only interfere with public participation, but legislators themselves may have limited access to bill substitutes before a vote, let alone journalists whose job it is to inform the public. Overall, these fast-tracking methods are unnecessarily hasty and may lead to careless mistakes or laws that are out of step with public opinion. Lawmaking should not be reduced to power plays, but be approached with careful consideration of intended and unintended consequences. 
KY legislature again excluded public via fast-track maneuvers, says League of Women Voters

Among the bills that were passed using one or more of these maneuvers were:

HB 4, restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and constraining instruction in public postsecondary institutions. 
HB90, originally focused on free-standing birthing centers, but last-minute additions included abortion-related provisions. 
HB241, a two-page bill allowing school districts to adjust calendars due to weather-related emergencies had multiple provisions about virtual education programs added on the Senate floor. 
HB 695, included last-minute changes to the state Medicaid program by adding mandatory work requirements for able-bodied adults. 
HB 775, a four-page bill on development districts that transformed to a 108-page bill making substantive taxation changes beyond development districts. 
SB 202, a five-page shell bill making innocuous word changes that became a 60-page bill to regulate the sale of cannabis-infused beverages.

Prior to these past two sessions, the League made recommendations to the General Assembly on how to strengthen public participation by respecting the Democracy Principle. We described how Kentucky’s Constitution, laws and legislative process rules actually provide opportunities for public participation in the lawmaking process. We urged the legislature to respect these constitutional and statutory requirements alongside its own procedural rules.
The 2025 legislative session lacks evidence that the General Assembly has taken these recommendations to heart. That’s why we took the message to the Capitol on the last day of the session, to unequivocally affirm that there should be no laws about us, without us. That is the heart of the Democracy Principle, and we will not let the people be ignored.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3756-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

Tina Spears called The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act were to succeed in the Rhode Island General Assembly. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Some things a Rhode Islander can do for the first time, legally, when they turn 18: Vote for president, visit a casino, or smoke a pack of cigarettes. 
A bill introduced by Rep. Tina Spears, a Charlestown Democrat, in the Rhode Island House of Representatives last week would add “use social media” to that list of coming-of-age privileges. 
“What it really does is it prohibits direct messaging on accounts for these youth who are under 18,” Spears said while introducing her bill Thursday, “They will not be able to use the platforms as they are currently structured today.” 
Spears reminded her colleagues on the Rhode Island House Committee on Innovation, Internet and Technology that the U.S. Surgeon General successfully curtailed smoking rates over time, and the same office recently cast youths’ social media usage in the same light. 
“The Surgeon General states, ‘We cannot conclude that social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents,’ which tells me as a policymaker and lawmaker, that we should be taking action to ensure that we are protecting our youth,” Spears told the committee, citing that youth often come into contact with self-harm content online.
Spears’ bill, The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act is a comprehensive effort to age-restrict social media usage and would require global social media platforms with more than five million users to verify the age of any Rhode Island user. Minors would not be able to make or use an account without their parent or guardian’s consent, and users would have two weeks to verify their identities.
Spears posed the bill as a public health effort as well as an attempt to shut off the illicit channels and activities young people can encounter in sparsely regulated online spaces.
“We do not allow drug trafficking, human trafficking, sextortion — any of those actions we do not allow in public venues in any way. Nor should we allow it on a social media platform,” the lawmaker said.
In addition to the restrictions on DMs, parents would have access to their children’s accounts, and minors would not be able to access social media sites between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. without parental consent.  
Pure direct messaging apps “where messages are shared between the sender and the recipient, only visible to the sender and the recipient,” as the bill text puts it, would presumably exclude services like Signal and WhatsApp from the bill’s reach. But it’s unclear whether something like Discord, which is a messaging app with social-media-esque aspects, would be subject to the proposed law.
Companies who violate the regulation would see a $2,500 fine per violation, and a $5,000 penalty for repeat violations. The bill imagines the Department of Business Regulation would oversee the regulatory process, although Spears told the committee, “They don’t feel they’re equipped to actually oversee this,” and have suggested pursuing other options for the regulatory framework. 
There’s no equivalent bill on the Senate side currently. Spears’ bill has some slight bipartisan support, thanks to House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale of Foster signing on as a cosponsor.

‘You cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right?’
Another bill heard in the same committee meeting led by Rep. Megan Cotter, an Exeter Democrat, features five of the same sponsors as Spears’ bill. It would require companies which provide online services youth are likely to access to keep minors in mind when designing their platforms and is based on a similar law in California that passed in 2022.
“I just want to preface first that I’m in full support of Representative Spears’ bill. My bill is slightly different. If I had a choice, I would choose hers over mine, to be clear,” Cotter said with a laugh as she sat before the House committee.
Cotter said her bill derives from a parent’s love — and concern. “When we first have a child, you get your first car seat for your child, go down to the police station…[and] make sure you’ve put it in your car safely,” Cotter said. 
Then Cotter held up her phone and added, “Then they get to teenage years, and we give them one of these, and you cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right? We kind of know there are no guardrails for them.” 
Cotter said she “expected the tech lobbyists” to lobby against her bill. 
After Cotter presented her bill, tech committee Chair Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, said, “Mom’s intuition should never be ignored. I think some of those big tech lobbyists you mentioned, I don’t know, maybe they’re in the crowd.”
No tech industry lobbyists testified at the hearing, but a few did submit written letters of opposition to Spears’ bill — all of them attached the names of national lobbying outfits, including NetChoice and the Chamber of Progress, the latter a trade group started by a former public policy executive at Google. 
Brianna January, the Chamber of Progress’s director of state and local government relations for the northeast, argued against the bill on several fronts in her written testimony, pointing to potential damage it would wreak on users and platforms alike. Websites may opt out entirely of the age verification process to avoid the hassle, January wrote, and “may turn entirely to children’s programming and eliminate all content for adults, turning YouTube into YouTube kids for everyone.” 
There could also be consequences for already marginalized teens who rely on social media and messaging for support and community, January wrote, especially LGBTQ+ youth who may “face unsafe or abusive home environments,” she wrote.
Concerns about privacy and the safety of young users also appeared in live testimony against Spears’ bill from Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island. McGunagle argued that social media can be “where a child finds social support that they don’t have at home, as well as a community and like-minded peers,” as well as a venue for political and civic engagement.
“Does the ACLU have a position on criminal activity and exposure to youth on these platforms? Do you possess a position on that?” Spears asked McGunagle. 
“Not off the top of my head,” McGunagle said. “I would be happy to look into that for you.”
Both Spears’ and Cotter’s bills were held for further study, as is standard practice at an initial hearing. Both bills would also go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if enacted.

Age gates popping up across the states 
A number of state legislatures have had success in cracking down on teenager’s social media use and have instituted similar bills. As of June 2024, 10 states had enacted such legislation, according to The Age Verification Providers Association, a trade group.
Enforcement can still be difficult, as detailed in a 2024 article by PC Mag, given that age verification methods — from photo IDs to facial recognition — each have drawbacks. Legal challenges to age-verification laws have been plentiful, although judges’ interpretations of verification laws’ legality varies. In March, a U.S. judge in Florida struck down tech companies’ challenge to a block on platforms’ use of “addictive” features with minors, The Florida Phoenix reported. But in Texas, a judge sided with the tech industry, temporarily blocking provisions of a law regulating minors’ access to certain kinds of content, calling it “unconstitutionally vague,” according to The Texas Tribune.  
Measures to shape how and what kids access online also exist at the congressional level, with a piece of legislation called the Kids Off Social Media Act, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii in January and buoyed by bipartisan support. Its cosponsors include Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, as well as Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent. 
Potentially more enforceable are bills which latch onto teenagers’ internet use at a location already regulated: school. At least 19 states had cell phone restrictions in school buildings as of June 2024, Education Week reported.
On Wednesday, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education heard a bill by Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, that would require school districts to set cell phone usage policies for their schools. Cell phone bans in public schools have become popular tools to mitigate waning classroom attention spans, with statewide bans seen in places as ideologically diverse as California and Florida, Stateline reported in February. The bill saw a healthy amount of support in written testimonies to the Senate committee.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)When Hurricane Helene tore through western Yancey County, Steve Boyd was one of thousands in the area who lost internet access.
The 70-year-old retiree, who lives outside of Burnsville, knows he got lucky. He didn’t lose his house, or his belongings — just a couple nearby trees that knocked out the power. For days after, getting back online was an afterthought.
“You don’t even think about internet when you don’t have lights, or anything else,” Boyd said.
His home, which sits off a miles-long county road, had been connected by coaxial cable. Shortly before the storm, he’d bought a new wi-fi system and new computers for him and his wife. But six months later, he’s still without internet. His provider, formerly a local shop that was later bought up by a larger company, has been working to restore service; he stops by their office daily.
Eventually, he broke down and decided to try out Starlink, the buzzy satellite internet service owned by SpaceX and Elon Musk. Boyd drove out to Best Buy and bought a $350 residential kit. When he got home, he set it up, only to realize there was a waitlist in the region. He paid $9 to get on it.
Many in western North Carolina impacted by Helene are now back online, after even the largest companies struggled to get service back up and running in the weeks after the storm. But the state isn’t just looking at getting access back to pre-Helene levels — it wants the entire state to have steady internet access.
It was set to be a long, complex process, even before Helene. Statewide connectivity means using a patchwork of solutions to reach communities like Boyd’s, investing hundreds of millions of dollars and navigating federal regulations that are about to see major changes.
All the while, natural disasters remain top of mind. When the mountains got hit, the whole region went off the grid. Can North Carolina prevent it from happening again?
Swaths of NC remain offline or underserved. The path to getting connected is complicated
Many parts of North Carolina remain either without stable internet or limited to slow speeds. Many of those places are rural communities — but not all of them. 
Parts of Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s most populous areas, still struggle with limited connectivity. But the most challenging regions to get online are the rural ones: parts of the northern Piedmont, and long stretches of the southwest.

“We have the second largest rural population in the country,” said Angie Bailey, the director of North Carolina’s broadband infrastructure office, in an interview with NC Newsline. 
“So it’s those people in those areas that are sparsely populated, and it’s also figuring out how to work with broadband providers so they can get a return on investment.”
In total, there are more than 213,000 “unserved” locations across North Carolina, according to Federal Communications Commission data from June 2024. Those places have less than a 25 megabit per second download speed and three megabit per second upload speed. An additional 130,000 locations are “underserved,” with higher but still subpar speeds.
But finding agreement between locals and government surveyors on where exactly wiring is needed isn’t always easy, as one North Carolinian told attendees of a recent panel on rural broadband.
“I have verified the same hog house four times, that it doesn’t need power,” said Erna Bright, who has led broadband expansion efforts in northeast Gates County. “The satellite picture says it’s there, it’s unserved. Well, that pig doesn’t know how to use it.”
In the state’s most remote communities, laying fiber lines for just a few homes often doesn’t equal profits for prominent fiber companies. So officials have to look to other methods: wireless systems that bounce signals off mountains, or satellite connections like Starlink.

Still, some advocates are wary of those regions getting the short end of the stick in the process.
“It feels a lot like rural America doesn’t matter to the people who are making those decisions,” said Sara Nichols, an energy and economic development manager for Land of Sky Regional Council. “Because rural America has been given the ‘alternative technology solutions’ time and time again, that doesn’t quite meet their needs. Or it doesn’t meet them for long enough, because the technology changes pretty quickly.”
‘Building for resiliency’: How North Carolina can prevent hurricane blackouts in the future
Nobody knows whether it will be eastern or western North Carolina that takes the brunt of the next storm. But there’s no question that there will be a next storm.
“I’m not sure people thought about resiliency in the same way before the storm as they do now,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “People just didn’t imagine that mountainsides were going to slide down.”
Part of the federal requirements for broadband projects is having safety nets in place — for both regional residents and first responders during emergencies. But state officials will have to decide how to build them — and how much to spend.
A new contract signals one key part of that plan — Starlink, Musk’s low-earth orbit satellite service. The state plans to buy kits from the company for local governments and emergency officials to use during disaster scenarios.

“We see them as a huge, important partner,” said Bailey, the state broadband office director. “A huge resource for the state and country.”
The world’s richest man garnered praise and headlines when he suspended Starlink charges in western North Carolina directly after the storm, and had additional equipment flown into the region. State lawmakers, after struggling to find kits, had “backchanneled with some of Musk’s people” to get more dropped off, said state Rep. Jake Johnson (R-Polk). 
The Republican lawmaker envisions a library-esque loaner system with Starlink kits in the future, where residents can “check out” a unit and pay the annual subscription fee.
“Really, you’re just no-interest financing it from the state,” Johnson said.
Concerns remain among some about Starlink as a permanent solution. Months after the storm, there’s a lengthy regional waitlist for residents who want to boot up and get connected. And others are wary of Musk’s close ties to the Trump administration.
“Obviously, I think there are real corruption problems that we’re going to have to manage going forward,” Ager said. “I don’t think we know what those are yet, but we certainly don’t want people making decisions about the federal government having the ability to enrich themselves.”
Money for hurricane-safe upgrades could come through extra federal money that doesn’t get spent on connection needs. Bailey said any money that’s left over could be used to address redundancies, as well as amping up cellular connections. 
And Johnson predicted there would be a hefty chunk left from a $100 million program to replace fiber poles. It could be used to buy Starlinks, he said, or to upgrade communications for fire departments, shelters and county emergency staff.
“That was kind of the worst part of the storm — that nobody could talk to each other for a long time,” Ager said. “Communication got really difficult. And that was true for emergency responders as well as just regular people.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages2025-HeleneRecovery-BatCave-SeanRayford-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on March 27, 2025, ordered top Trump administration officials to preserve records of their messages sent on the messaging app Signal from March 11 to March 15 following a transparency watchdog group’s lawsuit alleging that the officials have violated the Federal Records Act.
This marked the latest development since The Atlantic on March 24 published a Signal chat among Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security officials discussing specific plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief at The Atlantic, was mistakenly included in the chat and wrote about what he saw.
Trump administration officials have shared contrasting accounts about whether they were discussing sensitive war information on Signal – but maintain that they did not share classified information.
Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Arms Services committee, and Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat chairing the committee, on March 27 requested an investigation into how the Trump officials used Signal to discuss military strikes.
Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor, spoke with national security scholar Dakota Rudesill to better understand what constitutes classified information and how the government typically handles its most closely kept secrets.

How are government officials supposed to communicate about classified information?
The first way someone with the proper clearance can communicate about classified information is in person. They can talk about secret things in what is called a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF. This means a secure place, often with a big, heavy door and a lock on it, where security officials have swept the area for bugs and no one can easily eavesdrop. People who are in SCIFs usually have to leave their cell phones outside of the room, and then they can talk freely about secret information. A SCIF can be a particular room, or a floor of a building, or even an entire building.
Second, there is print communication: written documents with classification markings, which have to be handled in really particular ways, like in a safe location, and can be transported between SCIFs in secure containers.
Third, intelligence agencies, the White House and the Department of Defense also all have secure electronic systems. These include visual teleconferences, which are similar to a Zoom call and are secure for discussing highly classified information, as well as secure email systems and secure phones.
Many people with clearances have what is called “high side” email, which is shorthand lingo for classified email and messaging. Many people with security clearance would have two work hard drives and two computers. One of them is “low side,” where there is access to unclassified official email, documents and the internet.
All of these methods of secure communication can be clunky and take more time than people in our smartphone age are used to. That is the cost of protecting the nation’s secrets. My sense is the Trump administration officials wanted to move fast and turned to Signal, a commercial app that promises encryption. Signal is generally considered secure but is not perfect. There is abundant public evidence that Signal is not totally secure and indeed has been penetrated by Russian intelligence.
Can something be declassified after the information has been shared?
Yes. The president can classify and declassify at will via oral or written instruction.
The president’s constitutional powers include removing classification controls after information has been released or leaked. Trump could at any point declassify the information shared on Signal. Several of the Cabinet-level officials on that Signal chat also have expansive delegated powers over classification.
Even so, Trump’s national security Cabinet would have presumably still violated the law. For example, by putting national defense information inappropriately on an insecure app and not checking to verify the clearances of everyone on the chat and thereby allowing a reporter to be present, one could reasonably conclude that the team was showing “gross negligence,” running afoul of the Espionage Act.
The Espionage Act, enacted in 1917, criminalizes unauthorized retention and dissemination of sensitive information that could undermine the national security of the U.S. or help a foreign country.
Was the information shared on Signal likely classified?
Looking at the Signal message transcript that The Atlantic shared, it seems like at least four things were all but surely classified.
The most obvious was the details that Secretary of Defense Hegseth provided on the strike plans. These include the precise times that planes were taking off, what kind and when the bombs would fall. Recent reports have quoted defense officials confirming that this information at the time was classified.
Second, the chat revealed that the president gave a green light for secret strikes at a Situation Room meeting.
Third, there is the mere fact of these top officials deciding whether and when to execute attacks authorized by the president.
And fourth, according to media reports, the chat included the name of an intelligence officer whose position may have been secret.
The Trump administration says that there was no classified information in the chat. But several analysts have noted that defies belief. The exception would be a prior decision to declassify, but we have no evidence of that.
What other issues does this bring to mind?
First, we don’t know whether the Trump officials carefully thought about it before they set up this chat on Signal, which the Pentagon has warned government officials against using because of hacking concerns.
Second, even if the officials did make a focused decision to use Signal, what is the wisdom of that? I find it really, really hard to imagine that was a prudent decision when we think about how insecure this app is. There is also the fact that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East, was party to the chat while he was in Russia. We do not know for sure if he had a device running Signal on him personally while he was in Russia, but in any event he would have been under intense Russian surveillance.
A broader issue is how the Trump administration is enforcing the law is a giant question mark. Usually, the law both authorizes the U.S. government to do things, and also says it cannot do things. Law enables and limits everyone, including the president. However, Trump wrongly claims that he is the final authority on the law, and so far the Justice Department only seems to be enforcing the law against people outside of the administration.
So does the law limit the Trump administration in any practical sense? Right now it is not clear – and there is abundant reason to be concerned about that from a rule of law standpoint.

National Heritage Areas are “lived-in landscapes” that are “representative of the national experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them,” as defined by the Park Service. 
The Great Dismal Swamp is an environmental and cultural treasure, home to dozens of species of animals and, at one time, groups of Native Americans and formerly enslaved people who used it as a pathway to freedom.
The important details of where the conceptual boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp’s National Heritage Area would lie and who would manage any conservation, recreation and education opportunities remain unanswered questions at the moment. 
Sometime in 2026, the Park Service plans to submit a feasibility study to Congress that will answer those questions. Congress will have the final say on whether the region is suited for the federal designation. 
There are currently 62 designated National Heritage Areas in 36 states and territories. The unique federal designation does not result in any land transfers, local zoning changes or easements.

The entire state of Tennessee is a designated National Heritage Area, and the rights of landowners are not affected by the designation.
“A lot of people fear government overreach…” said John Warren, Communications Specialist at the National Park Service Northeast Region. 
“There’s no such federal footprint in a National Heritage Area. It is entirely something that the local community takes on and runs itself.”
Any federal funding for the proposed National Heritage Area would come by way of congressional appropriation. 
“A lot of those National Heritage Areas may receive up to $1 million annually, but others get a lot less,” said Warren. National Heritage Areas must receive matching funds from non-federal sources as well. 
The role of the National Park Service is to be a partner and advisor to the actual manager of the Heritage Area, called the “local coordinating entity,” an organization within the community chosen to interpret the history and traditions of the area and manage the conservation, recreation and education goals laid out by the project. 
 Creating a National Heritage Area

During virtual meetings held last week, members of the public shared their ideas on the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area’s potential location, its coordinating entity, and the natural, cultural and historic resources the region has to offer.

The public was also asked if opportunities exist for improving the quality of those resources through conservation, recreation and education. Comments are encouraged to be submitted in writing online, by mail or over the phone until May 19.
The public comments are not meant to be a vote, said Warren, but “a way to collect information.”
“The study has 10 criteria, and the answer to all of these has got to be ‘yes’ for us to be able to give a favorable conclusion that, yes, this qualifies as a National Heritage Area,” said Warren. “So it’s a high bar.” 
Warren said that anecdotally, over the last ten years only about half of the National Heritage Areas that were applied for ended up receiving the designation from Congress. 
As part of the study, the National Park Service staff has also spoken with potential state and local partners as well as possible coordinating entities. Chesapeake City Council has voiced interest in assuming the managing role, said Julie Bell, cultural resource project manager for the Park Service.
Nonprofits, universities, and state and local governments are some examples of coordinating entities that were chosen to manage other Heritage Areas around the nation. Any entity outside of the federal government is allowed to assume the role, including Indigenous tribes, said Bell. 
The Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area will involve coordination across state lines since the Virginia-North Carolina border slices directly through the swamp. 
In 2003, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established along with six others around the nation. The designation was Virginia’s third National Heritage Area to date. 
Two other possible National Heritage Areas have completed their feasibility studies and are currently awaiting a decision from Congress: the Finger Lakes Region in New York and the Kentucky Wildlands. 
 The story of the swamp

  An 1862 painting of the Great Dismal Swamp titled “Slaves Escaping Through the Swamp” by Thomas Moran (Photo courtesy of the National Park Service)
The National Park Service is developing themes that are present in the Great Dismal Swamp region to tell a nationally distinctive heritage story. One theme is “a place of refuge” and another is “a field of conflict.” 
Based on artifacts found in the Great Dismal Swamp dating back over 5,000 years, the Nansemond, Meherrin, Yeopim and Lumbee people were likely stewards of the swamp long before European colonists arrived, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
After colonization, the role of the swamp for local communities changed. About 50,000 self-emancipated African Americans, called maroons, along with free Blacks, Indigenous people and Europeans lived in the swamp in search of refuge. 
Some used it as a pause point on their journeys north, making the swamp an official water-based rest stop on the Underground Railroad, but others settled permanent communities there up until the end of the Civil War. 
Today, the Great Dismal Swamp is protected by a 113,000 acre National Wildlife Refuge managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. What is now a vast, uninhabited landscape is actually just a remnant of its former self. 
The once enormous swamp covered over 1 million acres, roughly the size of Delaware, but was drained over the years, first by a young George Washington in 1763. 
Washington and other investors initially aimed to create land in the swamp that could be sold for profit, then to dig a canal to transport goods across the swamp. Enslaved people were forced to provide the labor for these early economic ventures.  
One of the most successful business opportunities in the swamp turned out to be logging. The now globally rare Atlantic white cedar was in high demand, and gaining access to the trees required digging ditches to drain the swamp. By the 1950s, the last of the virgin timber in the Great Dismal Swamp was gone, according to a National Park Service story map. 
 The future of the swamp 

On George Washington’s birthday in 1973, about 50,000 acres of swamp land was donated to the Nature Conservancy and then handed over to the Fish & Wildlife Service, thus creating the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. 
“We have discovered that swamps actually play a vital role in our environment and that they are necessary,” said Warren. “You know, they’re not just places that we want to avoid because they have a lot of mosquitos or something like that. They’re places that are useful to the environment.” 
The Fish and Wildlife Service says the swamp serves as a permanent and migratory home for roughly 50 species of mammals, 200 types of birds and 100 species of butterflies. The diverse ecosystem ranges from bald cypress to red maple and Virginia’s last historic refuge of native Atlantic white cedar. 
In addition to the habitat the swamp provides to wildlife, it also prevents floods and improves water quality in nearby communities with a combined population of nearly 1 million people, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
A 2017 project to re-moisten the peat soils of the swamp served to benefit the surrounding population, including in Suffolk, by restoring a more natural water regime in the area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners installed adjustable dams in key places to regulate the amount of water leaving the swamp, improving the environment’s ability to provide its once inherent benefits. 
The re-moistened peat is now able to absorb stormwater more efficiently, acting like a sponge to reduce flooding during severe weather such as the storms and hurricanes that are common in the region. Healthy peat also stores more carbon, a valuable tool in combating global climate change. 
“This is a region that has already changed a lot,” said Warren. Creating a National Heritage Area “may have some influence on that, or it may not.” Those decisions would be left to the local community and the chosen coordinating entity.

In Virginia, there’s a shortage of 133 certified professional controllers from nine FAA air traffic control facilities that serve the commonwealth, according to data from the 11-year FAA Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan.

The FAA, along with other federal agencies, faced big cuts and employees were sent buyout offers at the start of the year by President Donald Trump’s administration, which is set on cutting “wasteful” spending. Some of the FAA positions cut focused on inspection and airport operations. 
U.S. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in January the buyouts offered could have negatively impacted the number of certified air traffic controllers.
“What happens if a few thousand air traffic controllers take that?” Warner said to DC News Now. “We won’t have air traffic potentially. It takes 18 months to get an air traffic controller trained up.”
However, Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau expressed a positive sign last week when he said the agency has made progress in addressing the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers. He stated that approximately 7,500 applicants are now being referred for testing to help fill the shortage of about 3,000 controllers.
“I’m thrilled to see that early results of (the) air traffic controller hiring supercharge were so promising. By prioritizing a merit-based process, cutting red tape, and increasing starting salaries, we are bringing in the best and brightest across America to help keep our skies secure at record speeds,” Rocheleau said in a statement.
The results come after Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy’s Feb. 27 hiring announcement for candidates.
 What’s driving the air traffic controller shortage?

The shortage of air traffic controllers responsible for ensuring the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system has been a long-simmering problem. Several factors contribute to the dearth of workers, including the FAA’s specific and lengthy training and certification process, antiquated control tower equipment, long hours on the job and the inability to hire career switchers past the age of 31. 
Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, representing nearly 20,000 professionals, spoke to federal lawmakers about the persistent controller staffing challenges earlier this month at a U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee hearing.
​​https://michiganadvance.com/2025/03/27/repub/after-deadly-midair-collision-lawmakers-grill-faa-army-on-shocking-lack-of-safety-system/
“A properly-staffed controller workforce is necessary in order to safely and efficiently meet all of its operational, statutory, and contractual requirements, while also having the personnel resources to research, develop, deploy, and then train the existing workforce on new procedures, technology, and modernization initiatives,” said Daniels on March 4 to lawmakers. 
He added that without a sustainable hiring, training, and staffing model, which is outlined in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, “the FAA will struggle to maintain the current capacity of the system, let alone modernize or expand it for new users.”
Attention on air traffic controllers increased after an FAA investigation into the Jan. 29 mid-air collision of a commercial jet and Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. The agency’s probe found that only one controller was on duty, which “was not normal,” with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision, the Associated Press reported. 
 How the recruitment and hiring process has improved

One of the ways the department is incentivizing interest in the open positions is by increasing starting salaries by 30% for candidates who go to the FAA Academy. The average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year.
Duffy said that the department would prioritize candidates who received the highest Air Traffic Skills Assessment Test scores for the FAA Academy and accelerate the time-to-hire for critical positions by cutting more than four months off the old process.
The FAA said once trainees successfully pass through the academy, they’ll be assigned to a tower or other facility across the country, where they’ll work toward their certification with experienced air traffic controllers.
“This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it,” Duffy said on Feb. 27. “The new streamlined hiring process is just the first step to deliver on President Trump’s agenda to prioritize the American people’s safety and modernize the federal government.”

It’s not surprising that Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in our current partisan landscape, failed to protest the damage inflicted on Virginians by President Donald Trump’s reckless cuts to the federal workforce. Rarely do politicians publicly criticize the president when they’re from the same party.
Youngkin tweaks state budget with eye on federal cuts, but embraces key spending

That’s why Youngkin focused on the nation’s monetary struggles rather than the indiscriminate, rapacious actions of Trump and his designated henchman Elon Musk, who runs the DOGE apparatus.
“Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,” Youngkin said earlier this month. “What that requires is real action quickly.”
Youngkin didn’t mention how the tax cuts that Trump rammed through in 2017 exacerbated the situation. After all, the national debt rose almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s first term. Nor did he acknowledge that Virginians are losing job security even though they’ve done nothing wrong. He also left out the lawsuits and recalls to work of thousands of employees that have followed some of the initial layoffs, and the protesters that have rallied against the callousness emanating from Washington.
Instead, the guv noted more than a quarter-million jobs are available through a state portal. He suggested many people who are laid off can still land on their feet.
Youngkin deserves opprobrium for suggesting Virginia can absorb a huge portion of those federal jobs – especially since many won’t be at comparable salaries. More than 341,000 federal workers lived in the commonwealth in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. The potential economic hardships that residents here face are too real, too devastating to Virginians’ livelihoods.
“The indifference to the suffering of Virginians – who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and were, in fact, extremely valuable to their agencies – is really problematic,” Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, told The Washington Post.
Besides, the correlation between the skills among Virginia’s federal employees and the state’s available jobs “at best was 30%,”  Terry L. Clower, director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis and a professor who studied the issue, said in an interview.
Governors to laid-off federal workers: We’ll hire you

The Washington Post reported, just days after Youngkin’s comments, that many offerings the state has listed come with large pay cuts compared to federal jobs.
Clower noted the ongoing uncertainty for laid-off federal workers has complicated their lives. Should they try to relocate? If recalled to the federal government, should they go back to their jobs – knowing their return to civil service could be reversed, yet again?
An ancillary factor: “A lot of the (federal) contractors are starting to pull back on their hiring, even if their contracts haven’t been touched,” Clower said.
A Youngkin spokesman told me Thursday by email that the state has identified 259,000 jobs open in the public and private sectors, and roughly 120,000 of them require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
“We are committed to ensuring that these opportunities are accessible to people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds,” said Peter A. Finocchio. “ … Whether someone wants to continue in their current field or explore something new, Virginia is ready to support them with the tools, training, and guidance they need to thrive.”
The problem begins when someone’s skills don’t match up with available jobs in Virginia. There’s also the issue of whether the employment opportunity is nearby or clear across the state.
For example, would someone living in the state’s “Urban Crescent” (the major localities from Northern Virginia down through Richmond and jutting southeast to Hampton Roads) move elsewhere – and vice versa? Cultural and urban-rural differences could be factors.
Families with school-age children probably would think twice about selling their home, changing school divisions and jettisoning established relationships in their communities – especially if pay and benefits are significantly lower under a new employer.
If laid-off federal workers from the commonwealth don’t like the job market here, “They’re likely to leave Virginia and go somewhere else. That’s a bad thing,” said Vinod Agarwal, deputy director of Old Dominion University’s Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy.
Such individuals would take their skills – and tax dollars – to another state. “That’s not good for Virginia’s economy,” Agarwal told me.
Last week, Axios.com reported that the Virginia Department of Health is facing layoffs after the Trump administration announced it’s cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-related funding. Axios said it was unclear how many VDH employees would lose their jobs. So federal cuts are having a ripple effect. 
On  Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would cut 20,000 positions, half through layoffs. Based in Washington, HHS said it would save $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.
These announcements never seem to acknowledge how services to Americans will inevitably decline because there will be fewer employees to handle the various duties.
Military veterans are especially at risk from the layoffs. They constitute around 30% of the federal workforce. Virginia is home to the third-highest share of veterans nationwide, based on percentage.
It’s bad enough that Trump’s administration continues to announce cuts. What makes it worse is the lack of transparency about the decision-making process used by DOGE, or why jobs in specific agencies are now deemed extraneous.
Which brings me back to Youngkin. It’s fine he’s taken steps to assist Virginians affected by the chaos in Washington over federal layoffs. His rosy pronouncements, however, can’t make up for lower pay and benefits and questionable job security.
He should convey that reality to the president.

Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat. The House version is sponsored by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat. If enacted, this legislation would protect against censorship in public and school libraries, and it would protect librarians. And it would make Rhode Island only the fifth state to protect the basic freedom to read (Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey are the other four).
The Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education has recommended that the proposed Freedom to Read Act be held for further study after conducting a State House hearing on March 12. But that is standard practice and doesn’t mean the end of the road for this important bill. 
Here’s why Rhode Islanders who care about democracy should support it.
Many Americans fear that the institutions protecting our democracy are under threat. Democracy originated in the city-states of ancient Greece, where citizens met in open forums to voice their opinions and share ideas. Ever since, the free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.
The First Amendment protects our basic freedoms, including freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protects books from being banned by government officials; however, that ruling is frequently ignored. Despite the fact that the First Amendment prohibits book banning, the number of actual attempts to ban them is increasing dramatically. In the 2023-2024 school year, PEN America counted more than 10,000 book bans in public schools. 
To any reasonably open-minded adult, the whole notion of forcing one’s own beliefs on others is preposterous. Probably every book ever written offends someone, somewhere, but hopefully no one wants to ban all books. No matter how innocent a book might seem, someone is bound to be offended. Winnie the Pooh? That honey-obsessed bear clearly has an eating disorder. And talk about eating disorders, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a field guide to compulsive overeating. Goodnight Moon? That poor kid’s rodent-infested bedroom is disgusting and unsafe. I wish I were being facetious, but I’m not — people have attacked these classic books for the reasons mentioned.










The free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.


How about Charlotte’s Web? Surely, no one could object to such a sweet, heart-warming story. Wrong. It was once banned from a few children’s libraries because a group of parents objected to the book’s “blasphemous” talking animals. There’s got to be an unoffensive book somewhere. I thought I found one: Sesame Street: Ready, Set, Brush! — a pop-up book featuring familiar Sesame Street characters demonstrating proper brushing techniques. Unoffensive? Not to some devout Jainists who avoid brushing their teeth because the act could harm the microorganisms living in the mouth. Fortunately, Jainists aren’t into book banning, or it’d be adiós Elmo and his toothbrush.
I could go on ad infinitum, but there’s no need. Books contain ideas, and even though some people are going to be offended, the unrestricted discussion of ideas must continue because that is the bedrock of democracy. Authors, librarians, and book lovers don’t want to silence anyone. We want to hear what you think about our books, and if a book offends you, please speak up. Write a letter to the editor, go to PTO and school board meetings, let us know what you think. Just don’t try to ban our books. Let us decide what books we want to read and what books we want our kids to read, and we’ll extend the same respect to you.
Amazingly, only 11 people were behind 60% of attempts to ban books in 2021-2022. Obviously, these folks are committed to their obsession, and nothing anyone can say is likely to dissuade them. Our best defense is to enact legislation that prohibits book banning and protects educators and librarians from censorship-related lawsuits.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments last week in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts.
The case could determine whether certain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations are reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — which has more liberal judges — or in regional courts, where certain states and industry groups would prefer to make their arguments.
The dispute centers around EPA’s decision that 21 states’ plans for ozone pollution failed to meet federal Clean Air Act standards. Oklahoma and Utah challenged that disapproval in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which spans six Western states. The federal agency argued the challenge should be heard in the D.C. Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is the venue for lawsuits over rules that are national in scope, while local or regional issues are heard in regional circuit courts. The EPA argues that it used a consistent methodology for all 21 denials, making it an issue that should be resolved nationally in a single court. Oklahoma and Utah contend that regional courts are better suited to account for state-specific factors.
During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to question the notion that states should bring their challenges to regional courts.
“[Air pollution] crosses the country in ways that don’t respect our jurisdictional boundaries between circuits,” he said.
Gorsuch suggested such an approach could create confusion, if states bring challenges to varying regional courts that issue conflicting rulings.
“We’re going to have different interpretations of the statute with different — different circuits and all these terrible splits and — and, gosh, we won’t have the immediate resolution of the D.C. Circuit that we could have,” he said.
Meanwhile, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that state-specific factors informed each EPA denial.
“It matters that you are Denver versus, you know, Arizona or whatever in terms of how the modeling works,” she said.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

A much smaller number — fewer than 50 — came out to show their support for Trump and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who holds an unofficial position in Trump’s administration.

There have been weekly protests outside the dealership in the Easton shopping development and in other cities since Trump took office in January. By Saturday, warm weather and rumors that the Proud Boys would come out in support of Trump and Musk swelled the ranks of those who wanted to protest the billionaires. Similar protests were held across the United States and around the world. 
Police separated demonstrators and counter-demonstrators. But both groups were peaceful, and in some instances talked seriously with each other.

People protesting Trump and Musk lined both sides of the street and wound around the corner. They expressed anger over many of the actions of the new administration, including its heavy-handed treatment of immigrants, its decimation of antitrust and consumer-protection watchdogs, and its perceived abandonment of Ukraine. 
But the major target of the protests was Musk and the power Trump has given him.
Musk wasn’t elected and he hasn’t been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But as he runs the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” he’s tried to hack away at government programs, many of which benefit the poor and average Americans.
For example, Musk is trying to fire 80,000 people from the Department of Veterans Affairs, he axed a program that pays farmers for produce for food pantries, and he’s trying to lay off tens of thousands at such agencies as the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. As he has, Musk’s unofficial agency has committed a series of blunders that have left many to question his competence. Even so, Musk has become even richer under the new administration.
Protesters held signs with a picture of Musk doing a now-infamous gesture mirroring a Nazi salute in January. Some noted that Musk’s own companies get millions a day in government subsidies as he targets what he sees as waste in other programs.

“We don’t want no swasticars,” went one chant that took jabs at Musk’s electric car and rocket companies. “Take a one-way trip to Mars.”
Peggy Kissel of Westerville said she was protesting because she felt like she needed to do something.
“I don’t feel like we have a say in what’s happening because Congress and the courts haven’t been able to stand up to the things that are happening,” she said as cars drove past, honking in support.
A man who helped organize the counter-protest declined to identify himself except to call himself “Patriot Dad.” He said he came out to defend the Tesla dealership after acts of vandalism and the discovery of incendiary devices in other cities.

“There actually are Americans who care about protecting an American company and American workers,” he said. “I thought maybe we should create a shield or create a wall around a building that is clearly a target for domestic terrorism right now.”
Asked about the cuts Musk and Trump are making, the man said, “Most of us who voted for Donald Trump knew what Elon Musk was going to be doing when he got in there. Quite honestly Trump has all the authority he needs to go in and create efficiencies and that’s what Elon Musk is doing.” 
Many of those who were protesting the new administration were adamant that Trump is abusing his power.
Miriam Scudder said she’s traveled to several foreign countries, including in Africa. She said she’s worried that Americans don’t appreciate the rights Trump and Musk are trying to erode.
“We have a certain privilege here in the United States that I don’t see in other countries,” she said. “I don’t think we really appreciate how much we have here and I feel like we’re throwing it away. I feel like we’re the spoiled child throwing a temper tantrum because of something we can’t agree on. No. 1 is immigration because hate and fear are powerful things.”

It’s been two decades since state legislators bowed to tourism industry lobbyists and passed a law forbidding local school districts from starting the traditional calendar school year prior to the last week of August.
It was a familiar case of industry campaign cash trumping recommendations of education experts and the wellbeing of children.
In the years since, local school districts — anxious to take advantage of completing their first semester prior to the Christmas break — have repeatedly tried to buck the rule and often gotten into hot water for doing so.
Now, thankfully, it looks like legislative leaders may be backtracking a bit. Under a Senate bill introduced last week, the permissible start date would be set a week earlier — the Monday closest to August 19 — and it’s a welcome proposal.
The bottom line: The bill isn’t perfect as local districts would prefer more flexibility and tourism special interests are still being given way too much say-so in the matter, but in a legislature that so often ignores the best interests of kids, it’s better than nothing.

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)Women hold top spots in New Hampshire politics, including the governorship and three-quarters of the congressional delegation. In the Legislature, though, they remain significantly underrepresented.
While women make up 50.1% of the state’s population, per the latest census, they make up only 35.8% of the legislative chambers combined, according to data from Rutgers University’s Center for American Women in Politics. Historically and today, the largest gender gaps are in the 400-person House. Women are also typically underrepresented in the 24-person Senate, but they have reached gender parity briefly this century and, for two years, outnumbered men in the chamber by one seat.
Women lawmakers across the political spectrum offered a variety of opinions on why women remain underrepresented in the Legislature — and whether that underrepresentation has policy consequences for the state. While New Hampshire’s citizen Legislature is a point of pride for many, some said the $100-a-year pay had a disproportionate impact on women, who studies show still bear the brunt of child care and domestic duties. Women who were raising children while in office said strong support systems were essential for allowing them to do their work as elected officials.
Researchers said women see better representation in legislatures that are more professionalized, meaning elected office is a full-time job with better pay and resources like strong staff support and an office. They also pointed to other factors affecting women’s participation, like party recruitment efforts.
Some lawmakers described the personal impact of being a woman in a space dominated by men. They felt they had to work harder than their male colleagues to be taken seriously, and faced gendered stereotyping or assumptions. Meanwhile, others felt their gender posed no or little challenge to their political life.
New Hampshire is in the middle of the pack among states when it comes to women’s representation in legislatures. Nevada is the only legislature where women outnumber men, making up 60.3% of the chambers. In Arizona, women and men have equal representation, and in the other 48 states, there are more men than women. In Congress, 28% of lawmakers are women.
The share of women in the Legislature, with some spikes, has remained relatively stagnant over the decades.
“One of the things that those of us who study this like to say is that, you know, there’s nothing inevitable about women’s representation. It’s not as though time itself changes anything,” said Anna Mahoney, the executive director of Dartmouth College’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences. “What changes women’s participation in government is action, either on behalf of political parties, or grassroots organizations, (or) women candidates themselves.”

In the chambers, on the trail
There’s a question Becky Whitley heard more than any other in her brief run for the state’s 2nd Congressional District last year — a question she wonders if a male candidate would hear.
“The number one question that I was asked, even by my own family members, was, you know: ‘What about your son?’” Whitley said. “And so I just question whether — and I don’t know, I can’t speak from experience — do men get the same questions, right?”

Whitley represented the capital area as a Democrat in the state Senate from 2020 to 2024. In her political experience, she felt women faced different pressures and expectations than men. That was felt across the aisle, too.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican and a deputy majority leader in the Senate, said she’s used to challenging those expectations.
“If you’ve seen me, I have big hair, and I wear high heels. I think that people underestimate me because I don’t want to change my style to be taken more seriously, right?” Ricciardi said. “So you have to work harder. … I have to prove myself, but I don’t mind. In fact, it feels like a victory when you do prove yourself, and people see the real you.”
Ricciardi isn’t a fan of party politics; she said she’s motivated instead by “doing what’s right for people.” She said she feels women in a male-dominated space “have to work harder to be taken more seriously.”
While she said she hasn’t really experienced this perception from voters, “I definitely think with colleagues, I think there’s just this thought that … we’re not as smart or we can’t do it … the way they want to do it,” she said.
Whitley said “women have a very fine line to walk.”
“I felt this acutely in terms of … our standards for behavior, in terms of how strong we can be, in terms of our decorum, in terms of what we look like, what we can say,” Whitley said. “I felt very acutely that the line for what was appropriate for women in, you know, the public sphere was … quite different than it is for men. And so … I have always felt like, you know, I have to work a little bit harder. I have to be a little bit clearer. I have to … really walk that line. And I certainly think that men in my same position don’t feel that way.”

Other women lawmakers felt differently. Asked whether there are still obstacles for women in politics today, Sen. Regina Birdsell, a Hampstead Republican who serves as majority leader, said, “When I first got in, I say yes, but things are really starting to open up.” She said she has often observed women beat out men in legislative races, and that she has seen more younger women getting involved than when she first ran in 2010.
“If a woman is really interested in running, and they do it right, I think they have a much better chance of prevailing,” Birdsell said. “So I think … if you know how to do it, and you do it right, I think the door is wide open for you.”
Rep. Judy Aron, a South Acworth Republican who chairs the House Environment and Agriculture Committee, said she felt “we’re way past that” in terms of women facing obstacles in politics.

“I don’t know that there’s any particular right number of percentage. I mean, why should it be 50/50?” Aron said. “I think it’s a matter of … who our voters think are qualified to do these jobs, or be in these elected positions.”
But others felt fewer women in the Legislature meant less attention on issues that impact women. Mahoney, the Dartmouth researcher, said “a lot of the research shows that when you have more women in your legislature, the topics that you’re talking about and the legislative agenda itself shifts.”
Ricciardi pointed to the “Momnibus” bills, legislation aimed at maternal health spearheaded by women. Male colleagues aren’t as focused “on maternal issues, child care issues, family issues as much, and those are really important things that we need in our state,” she said.
Women have unique lived experiences to bring to the table, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who was the first woman in American history to be elected both as a governor and a U.S. senator. 
“You know, I used to say this a lot when I became the first woman to be elected as New Hampshire’s governor: women make up half of our population, and we have different life experiences than men do,” Shaheen said in a statement to the Bulletin. “Not better or worse — but different, and it’s important to have those experiences and views represented, regardless of which side of the aisle those women fall on.” 
Women shape elected bodies beyond just legislation, Mahoney said. Their presence in legislatures can affect everything from the architecture of the buildings where they work — adding women’s restrooms by the chambers’ floors where they weren’t before or rooms for nursing — to the culture of the chambers.
“When we look to see what kind of impact women have once they’re in the institution,” she said, “one of the things that I like to look at is not just necessarily the bills that they are supporting or that they’re voting for, but how they’re changing the institution itself.”

Challenges and solutions
The challenges facing women are multipronged, and so are the solutions to getting more in office, researchers said.
“We need societal and cultural change,” Mahoney said, “but we also need the nuts and bolts of party infrastructure and legitimate support in order to increase the number of women running for office.”
Those recruitment efforts may be difficult for candidates of any gender at a time “when government is not necessarily seen as a place where good things can get done efficiently,” and trust in American institutions is low, she said.
In terms of challenges on the campaign trail, research into voters’ perceptions of women candidates is “sort of mixed,” Mahoney said. 
In the general election, “you don’t see as much bias, because people are really relying on party cues, and so they’re going to vote for their party regardless of who the candidate is,” she said. “It’s really in those primary contests where women face specific challenges of fundraising, whether they are perceived to be really legitimate candidates that can win, and those sorts of things.”
Women candidates can benefit in elections where topics considered “women’s issues” — like reproductive rights — are important, Mahoney said. 
The set-up of a legislature can pose its own challenges. Emily Baer, an assistant professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, pointed to the fact that in more professionalized legislatures, with better pay and more staff support, “women tend to be better represented.”
The “flip side” of having a citizen Legislature in New Hampshire, she said, “is it’s much harder  for women to serve in a state that is not providing them with the resources to pursue that as a career, while also balancing other things in their personal and professional lives.”
This may have an acute effect on women in particular because of factors like being underrepresented in professions that are considered political pipelines, as well as access to child care and other resources, she said.
“A lot of studies still show that women, even when they are working full-time professional careers, still do a lot more at home in terms of household responsibilities and child care responsibilities,” Baer said, “and serving in the state Legislature — particularly if it’s not something that can be a career for them, and they’re balancing it alongside their own professional career and then higher levels of responsibility at home — that’s something that affects women politicians much more than it would affect male politicians.”
Additionally, the citizen Legislature has a “bias towards older, retired individuals,” Baer said, “because they might have more time and slightly better financial position to allow them to serve in those legislatures. And so when we talk about parity in women’s representation, you want parity that actually reflects the diversity of that group as well.”
Research has found that women often wait to run for office until their children have gone to school or left home, which “frequently delays women’s entrance into politics,” Mahoney said. For many, family support is key.
Whitley, the former capital-area state senator, said her supportive spouse and community, as well as her mother nearby, made her public service possible.
“But not everyone has that, and so if one of those things weren’t true, I wouldn’t have been able to serve,” Whitley said. And, even then, serving longer than the four years she was in office “just wasn’t sustainable for my family,” she said.
  Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka (Senate Staff)
Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a Portsmouth Democrat, said her legislative work “requires a lot of supportive people in my life, and also a really good mastery of Google calendar.” 
She’s found it helpful to talk with other moms doing similar work, and she hopes to return the help, even if it’s just talking about the actual logistics of the job, like juggling legislative demands with getting the kids to school. 
“Just being able to kind of demystify that, I think, for people makes it a little more accessible,” she said.
Birdsell, the Senate majority leader, said a program she was in aimed at getting Republican women in the state to run for office helped her greatly. They learned about media, the basics of the Legislature, went to Washington, D.C., and met stakeholders involved in the political process. That program is now defunct, but she said she would love to see its return.
And while state legislatures can be stepping stones to higher office, a number of women who propelled themselves to the highest political planes in New Hampshire — Congress and the governorship — did so without first serving in the State House, Baer noted, suggesting other avenues for women candidates.
Perkins Kwoka thinks women serving can act as a positive feedback loop.
“The more women we have serving, the more women, I think, will be able to see themselves in the role,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8020-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 05:03:04.198915

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.

More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage

In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study.
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Democrats pushed through this plan without Republican support after Senate Republicans refused to support a change package for the current fiscal year to address the immediate MaineCare funding deficit unless it included structural reform to the program.
The majority party argues a stopgap two-year budget was needed to “keep the lights on” and provide consistency to Mainers amid federal uncertainty, but that it was only “part one.” The budget leaves some things unfunded, notably another expected shortfall for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. Democrats say that was an intentional decision to wait for updated state revenue projections and any changes coming from Washington D.C. 
Republicans argue, because of that, the budget isn’t balanced and also doesn’t include any of the policy changes Democrats may be looking to adopt in a “part two” budget — a framework they disavow as disingenuous. 
Some from the minority party have started collecting signatures for a People’s Veto of the budget that passed, which, if they secure at least 67,682 signatures from Maine voters by June 18, would put the law on hold until the November election or an earlier statewide special election — causing a government shutdown. 
“It’s reckless. It’s chaotic. It’s what we’re seeing in Washington, D.C., brought here to Maine,” Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Bidderford) said of the People’s Veto.
Political jabs aside, how are legislators honestly thinking about re-evaluating spending in light of the projected $450 million deficit over the next two years?
That budget bill was “not the last word,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said.
“We need to start having the conversations about what the 132nd Maine Legislature wants,” Daughtry said. 
‘March majority madness’: Legislative Democrats pass two-year budget over Republican objections

Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said his primary concern for the remainder of session is MaineCare. 
“It’s not fixed,” Stewart said. “We are highly likely to be right back in here within a year dealing with yet another Medicaid bailout, to say nothing of what happens on the federal front.”
First, how much money is left? 
Republicans argue there is no money left for more work this session. Democrats argue that’s not true. There’s validity to both claims, depending on how you view the situation. 
The state is expected to bring in $11,224,416,665 in revenue over the next biennium, fiscal years 2026 and 2027, based on the latest forecast from December. 
While the general fund appropriations in the budget that passed last week total $11,320,717,493 for that timeframe, the total net impact is actually a bit less, $11,229,531,053.
Factoring in these new appropriations, remaining balances carried over and transfers, Christopher Nolan, director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review, said fiscal year 2027 is expected to end with $127,737,632. 
This is what’s left for lawmakers to still appropriate in a “part two” budget or through individual bill spending.
However, funding the expected Medicaid gap in 2027 would absorb most of it. The tax increases and program cuts Gov. Janet Mills proposed will be considered in the next budget, which could free up more dollars for new initiatives. 
Uncertainty on the federal level adds another layer of complications to the funding landscape. On the state-level, the latest fiscal briefing from the Office of Fiscal and Program Review released last week shows general fund revenue is currently $28 million below budget. Much could change before the updated revenue forecast in May. 
There’s also another strategy lawmakers have expressed interest in exploring that could alter how much money they have to work with: resetting baseline spending, which the recently passed budget continued as is. 
Regardless, there is apprehension about fiscal possibilities, as underscored by Rep. Amanda Collamore (R-Pittsfield) on the House floor last week. 
“What is the point of working any bill with a fiscal note that isn’t negative?” Collamore asked. “I’m not sure it’s responsible to vote for any bill, including my own.” 
The process will, and should still play out, Stewart said. 
“We don’t know what we don’t know until we get there,” he said.
In any session, regardless of the economic landscape, the budget process is murky with many bills dying by way of the “appropriations table,” which all legislation with a fiscal note ends up on even after passing the House and Senate. 
Last session, less than 10% of bills on the table became law. 
The final arbiters are the legislators who sit on the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, and the behind-the-scenes negotiating that determines their votes, along with the governor’s veto pen. 
Daughtry and Fecteau both said they believe what comes next shouldn’t actually be up to them. 
“I recognize as a leader I have a larger bully pulpit than the average members but I have trust in my colleagues not only on the policy committees but also on the Appropriations Committee,” Daughtry said. “I really am trying to keep my palate dry and wait and see what my colleagues are able to come up with, what our members of the public say as well.”
While acknowledging that the Legislature has a balancing act ahead of it, Fecteau agreed.
“I’m not going to sit here and say I can identify all of the ways in which we can save money from the baseline or we can save money from not moving forward new initiatives that were proposed or how we can generate revenue in the most effective way,” Fecteau said. “But what I can say is it will all be on the table and up for consideration amongst my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. That’s their charge.”

What’s possible with what’s left? 
Stewart often repeats his stance that the state has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Before the start of the session, he told Maine Morning Star he wanted the Legislature to audit the state budget to assess whether current funding levels are adequate. 
So what do lawmakers want to reassess? “It’s all the above,” Stewart said. “You’ve got to start peeling back the layers of the onion.”
Vacancies 
There’s the assumption, and historic reality, that the governor will get most of what she asks for, which includes a plan for approximately 250 more government positions. Stewart wants to see the state address vacancies first. 
As of Feb. 13, there were 1,975 vacancies out of 13,557 permanent positions, amounting to a 14.6% vacancy rate, according to the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Affairs. For comparison, the vacancy rate in February 2024 was 16.6% and in March 2023 was 16.2%.
DAFS Director of Communications Sharon Huntley said there are many reasons positions are vacant, and sometimes it’s intentional, such as with seasonal positions, which make up 10% of the current vacancies.
“It’s also important to note that eliminating a position will not necessarily save money,” Huntley said. “Of the 1,975 permanent vacancies, nearly half don’t include any general fund funding. For example, positions that are in place to use on as-needed basis funded with non-general fund dollars. While vacant they don’t cost the state or the fund anything, and, similarly, eliminating them won’t save anything.”
Additionally, each biennial budget includes savings from attrition — the assumption that there will be gradual staff reductions due to employees leaving and not being replaced. The two-year budget that passed included a 5% attrition rate level, up from 1.6%, which means the state has to have some level of vacancy in positions that are funded with general funds to achieve this budgeted savings.
Aside from a focus on vacancies, Stewart questioned, “what’s the vision?” 
Pointing to Maine students’ low test scores, inadequate mental health supports — a key point of contention in budget debates last year — and closing hospitals, which had already been struggling financially with high operating costs and low reimbursement rates before the supplemental budget scuffle, Stewart said reforming systems is what’s needed.
In Stewart’s view, that’s namely MaineCare. 
Health care
Legislative Republicans already presented proposals for reforming the program during supplemental budget negotiations, which Stewart said they’ll continue to push. These include requesting waivers from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to mandate reductions in enrollment, as well as institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults. 
The mandated reduction could start with a full review of everyone on the program to eliminate people who no longer qualify, Stewart said. What exactly work requirements would look like, he doesn’t know. The Trump administration may make such changes on the federal level, though he doesn’t see that as a reason to avoid doing it on the state-level first. 
Daughtry said she’s willing to discuss MaineCare reform. 
“If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas,” Daughtry said, “but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.” 
Approximately 30% of Mainers and roughly half of all Maine children are covered by MaineCare. “I really do feel healthcare is a human right,” Daughtry said. She also said it’s the will of the people, who have twice approved expansions to MaineCare at the ballot box. 










If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas, but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.


– Senate President Mattie Daughtry


Fecteau said he’d entertain the reforms left on the table by Senate Republicans rejecting the supplemental deal, specifically restrictions to ensure that people who win the lottery or who are incarcerated don’t remain eligible for MaineCare.
While Fecteau said the two-year budget could have fully funded MaineCare through 2027, the decision not to was an effort to say “let’s have an open and earnest conversation around potential reforms.”
Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington (R-York) explained in a press conference last week that the minority party’s ultimate goal is to shift people currently on MaineCare to federal exchanges.
Maine is one of 19 states, and Washington D.C., that fully run their own health insurance marketplace, called CoverME.gov. 
Last month, nearly 65,000 Mainers signed up for affordable health coverage through CoverME.gov for 2025, according to Health and Human Services Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. However, Maine’s Office of Health Insurance Marketplace is the smallest in the nation and the office is requesting more positions in this next budget to keep up with growing enrollment. 
For people who are working, Harrington argued, “These folks can afford to pay something for health insurance. We should be encouraging them to do so.”
Daughtry said such a claim misunderstands how the marketplace works, as people are not able to enroll if their income threshold is below the bar that qualifies them for MaineCare.
“It’s ensuring that folks are able to find a product that meets with their income guidelines,” Daughtry said. “Now, if we could actually have the real conversation behind driving more people to the marketplace, it’s making sure people have more money in their pockets.” 
Daughtry hopes the Legislature considers bills that seek to establish a living wage, particularly addressing underpay in the public sector, as well as proposals to help families, such as better supporting childcare.  
Harrington and Stewart also argued that high MaineCare enrollment hurts hospitals, as they only receive a 70% reimbursement through the program compared to higher private-payer reimbursements. 
Daughtry argued the state should increase MaineCare reimbursements. However, she added that private insurance is also not reimbursing people enough. 
“It’s not just MaineCare,” Daughtry said. “The health care system as a whole is broken.” 
Taxes and cuts
Given the $450 million deficit the state is facing over the next biennium, and that only $127 million remains for the second year, program cuts and taxes are being considered, including the slate of changes Mills proposed that were not included in the “part one” budget.
Progressives are not supportive of her plan to cut some programs, including childcare workers stipends, and Republicans have already drawn a line in the sand regarding tax increases of any kind. 
While Mills has suggested a number of largely regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on low earners, some Democratic legislators are alternatively pushing for a model that taxes the wealthy more, including a “millionaire tax,” similar to a law recently passed in Massachusetts to tax income over $1 million by an additional 4%. 
One of Fecteau’s proposals, LD 1082, is to increase the real estate transfer tax on home sales above $1 million to increase the resources the state commits to the construction of affordable housing. Other lawmakers have proposed taxes on short-term rentals or changing the timeframe for accessing Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credits to fund things like affordable housing and education without adding to state spending. 
Albeit in different ways, there’s consensus that systems need to change. 
Stewart said of Democrats, “They want to be all things to all people all the time,” intentionally or not, calling back to the phrase Mills repeated when she first introduced her budget plan in January. 
“I don’t think government can, or should, be all things to all people at all times,” Mills said in defense of her proposed cuts and tax increases.
Ultimately, as Fecteau put it, “It’s going to be a balancing act.”

Encino Energy was chosen to lease 62 acres of land in Leesville, which is property of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Friday’s meeting lasted about 15 minutes. 
The commissioners posted the nominated leasing parcel for bid on Jan. 2, and the deadline to submit bids was Feb. 1. Each lease agreement includes a 12.5% royalty paid to the state for production, per state law, with an additional financial incentive paid by the winning bidder to the state, according to ODNR.

The lease bonuses for these nominations chosen by the committee is $218,715 for ODNR properties, according to ODNR.
Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas. Anti-fracking advocates from Save Ohio Parks shouted questions and concerns while the commissioners conducted their meeting. 
Two nominations were considered and approved to go to bidding for fracking by the commission on Friday — 171 acres of Leesville and a possible right-of-way along SR 149 owned by the Ohio Department of Transportation in Belmont County. These nominations will go out to bid in April. 
Two nominations were up for a vote during Friday’s meeting that were not voted on — 3.6 acres in Valley Run Wildlife Area in Carroll County and a possible right-of-way along SR 151 owned by ODOT in Harrison County. 
“I propose we bring it up only for discussion today,” OGLMC Chair Theresa White said. Even though the commissioners approved the motion, there was no discussion on either piece of land. OGLMC plans to take action on these nominations at a future meeting. 
Melinda Zemper with Save Ohio Parks said Ohio needs a moratorium on natural gas fracking under state parks and public lands. 
“Gov. Mike DeWine and state legislators risk good health, our pristine lands, our water and air and livable planet by continuing to support this dangerous and polluting 20th century energy industry in our quickly warming 21st century,” she said. 
Before the meeting, Roxanne Groff also with Save Ohio Parks talked about the Jan. 2 well pad explosion in Guernsey County. The well pad is operated by Gulfport Energy and no one was injured. The Guernsey County Emergency Management Agency issued an evacuation notice within half a mile of the well pad. 
“Salt Fork State Park is going to be completely surrounded by frack well pads, and any one of those pads can have an explosion,” Groff said. “What are you going to do when there are 2,000 people in that park and there’s a well padded explosion?”
There were more than 1,400 fracking incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio between 2018 and September 2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. About 10% of those incidents were reported as fires or explosions.
“Our parks, our children, our grandchildren’s lives are at stake here, and you’re about to just say that doesn’t matter,” Groff said. 
Andrew Goode and Anthony Jesko are two new members of OGLMC. Both men were appointed to the commission by DeWine on Dec. 19, 2024.  Jesko is an attorney from Northeast Ohio and his term will expire Sept. 29, 2028, and Goode is an attorney from central Ohio and his term expires on Sept. 29, 2029. 
“I’ve listened intently to what you guys have said, and I will continue to listen to that, just so you guys are aware,” Goode said, referring to the comments Groff made before the meeting.

Other GOP politicians are holding back.
The 2026 gubernatorial race is heating up. Right now, there are three candidates seeking the GOP nomination: entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Attorney General Dave Yost and businesswoman Heather Hill.
Already, endorsements are coming out.
Hill hasn’t received any, from research into statewide or local groups and politicians.
Yost has a coalition of about 30 county sheriffs and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell.
Ramaswamy has received support from President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson of the Eighth District, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Treasurer Robert Sprague, a coalition of about 20 sheriffs, religious lobbyist Aaron Baer and dozens of state lawmakers like Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
“He has the vision, business expertise, and relentless drive to make Ohio the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family,” McColley said in a statement.
But two of the most powerful Statehouse Republicans haven’t spoken up yet, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Tressel as lieutenant governor after appointing previous Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to the U.S. Senate.
“Well, the last I looked, we’re about 14 months away from the primary, let alone from the general election,” DeWine responded when asked about his endorsement and whether he is waiting for Tressel to get in the race. “So it’s a long, long way to go, and I’m sure there’ll be other people who get in the race.”
The governor hasn’t issued his endorsement yet, with many GOP strategists like Bob Clegg believing that he possibly chose his lieutenant governor — former OSU coach Jim Tressel — as his future replacement.
“He also picked somebody who has about 95% name ID in the state of Ohio, which is very rare,” Clegg said. “And Jim Tressel cannot have a better image here in the state of Ohio.”
Name identification refers to the number of voters who know you off the top of their heads already.
Although he hasn’t announced, Tressel has been out and about — headlining Republican events and fundraisers across the state. We asked him this week about when he will enter the race.
“When I was coaching, I would tell you I’m not thinking about the next game,” the former coach responded. “I’m thinking about this game. That hasn’t changed.”
The LG recently created a 2024 transition fund, which allows him to collect money for inaugural events. However, he filed the account after his inauguration. We asked his team why this was. Still, it would be illegal for him to use any of that money for campaign-related activities.
Tressel added that he has been busy learning about energy policy, foster care, education and workforce development.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, also hasn’t made his decision.
“The most important thing that I’m doing right now is getting the House of Representatives to come together cohesively on passing a budget,” the speaker said.
The state operating budget has monopolized this General Assembly so far, as it typically does in odd years.
“I don’t need some reason for people not to like somebody else across the aisle and not just across the Republican-Democrat aisle but across these aisles,” he said, gesturing to the GOP side of the chamber. “I don’t want to try to divide this caucus, so I’ve told all these folks if I’m going to endorse that’s not until after June 30th. Obviously, members of the House can do whatever they want.”
The Ohio Republican Party also hasn’t endorsed yet, but as DeWine said, there are more than 400 days until the primary.
“We have a long way to go,” the governor said.
Whoever wins that primary will face off against the Democratic nominee, likely former Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)No one asked for hippos to overrun Colombian rivers.
But hippos frolic in the South American country anyway, thanks to the extravagant ego of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. He imported four of the beasts for a private menagerie. After his death, they escaped and multiplied, turning into an invasive species bedeviling officials. The government has sought to sterilize and deport the beasts, but cocaine hippos keep on thriving.
And so it is with bad ideas in the Kansas Legislature. Each year lawmakers wade through scads of proposals introduced by out-of-state think tanks or touted by conservative influencers, none of them with the slightest connection to actual Kansans’ problems or concerns.
Such ideas are the cocaine hippos of Kansas politics, taking up residence in the credulous heads of GOP lawmakers and driving out all hope of sensible policymaking.
Once you spot these cocaine hippos (I must give credit to classical music critic David Hurwitz for introducing me to the term), you can’t ignore them. Their bulky yet slippery bodies have twisted and distorted the state’s political landscape. Eradicating the creatures, in whatever ways possible, will only strengthen government.
Here are five hippos spotted in the past few months.
“The Legislature adopted a spending plan Thursday that fully funds public schools, provides pay raises for state employees, eliminates DEI initiatives, polices pronouns in emails, and puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.” (March 27)
You might support or oppose diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives or people sharing their pronouns in email messages. But what do they have to do with any problems in Kansas? Who has been actually, provably harmed by any of this? Kansans have been swept along by a nationwide panic over innocuous attempts to create a more caring and accepting society.
House Republicans refused to consider a plea from Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn to send a message that there is no place for racism in the state of Kansas.
Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, proposed an amendment to House Bill 2299, which declares that antisemitism is against the public policy of the state. She wanted to expand the language to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination. (March 26)
Racism and antisemitism are both bad. Very bad. Yet why were legislators taking up or debating this bill in the first place? Discrimination on the basis of both is already illegal. Hate crimes are illegal, too. Have we seen any recent examples of such or related public unrest in Kansas? (And no, muted protests against Israel in its war against Hamas don’t count.)
The House and Senate on Tuesday overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of legislation that could result in thousands of advance ballots being disqualified. (March 25)
You know who has administered elections in Kansas for years? Republicans. You know who has repeatedly reassured Kansans that our elections are safe and secure? Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab. There is no evidence that allowing three days for mail-in ballots to arrive will cause any problems. But Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, has swallowed the propaganda of President Donald Trump hook, line and sinker. U.S. elections are free and fair, and there have been no issues in Kansas.
Still, the cocaine hippos overturn boats.
Kansas House Republicans have repeatedly met in closed caucus meetings this legislative session, doing state business in secret and upending longstanding tradition. (March 24)
Republicans enjoy preposterous supermajorities in the House and Senate. They have no reason to fear sunlight or transparency. Their leaders have more options and flexibility than they have enjoyed in years. And yet, they hide. They have somehow come to believe that letting people see what they do — even if it’s as simple as persuading members to vote one way or another — simply can’t be shared. But why? What harm have they suffered?
The House still approved Senate Concurrent Resolution 1602, a nonbinding statement that urges the governor to help secure the U.S. border with Mexico and work with federal authorities to enforce immigration laws. (March 20)
As has been pointed out repeatedly, and as can be seen by merely glancing at a map, Kansas doesn’t share a border with Mexico. We have to deal with Oklahoma and Missouri, which are bad enough. Immigration fearmongering has no connection with anything actually witnessed in Kansas. As a matter of fact, whole sectors of our economy would shut down without migrant labor.
And I could go on, but cocaine hippos have a way of crowding out all rational thought.
While those of us watching from afar can see the way in which these malignant ideas have infiltrated our government, they have found surprisingly receptive hosts in lawmakers. Indeed, the mental landscape of many in Topeka would appear entirely unrecognizable to many of us. They have welcomed the hippos, praised them as saintly creatures and called on them to reproduce even more freely.
As far back as 2012, literary critic Harold Bloom raised alarms about this tendency.
In a lecture about poet Walt Whitman, he told a crowd: “We are far along on a route away from democracy into the morass of plutocracy, … oligarchy and theocracy, because many millions among us live a reality completely separate from that of those in this room, for instance. The function of literary criticism at the present time cannot be the struggle with this Moby Dick of the American spirit, yet awareness of it should be part of our common ordeal of consciousness.”
Kansas and its residents confront real obstacles. We experience real needs. Schools and special education require investment. The tax system demands rebalancing, making sure those who profit the most help everyone else. Petty hatreds and discrimination deserve to rot in the ash heap of history.
Instead, we fight nonexistent problems with phantom weapons.
And those cocaine hippos keep breeding.

Nearly every modern medical treatment can be traced to research funded by the National Institutes of Health: from over-the-counter and prescription medications that treat high cholesterol and pain to protection from infectious diseases such as polio and smallpox.
The remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it’s easy to take them for granted.
However, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration’s direction. The administration has also proposed a dramatic reduction in federal support of the critical infrastructure that keeps labs open and running. Numerous scientists and health professionals have noted that changes will have far-reaching, harmful outcomes for the health and well-being of the American people.
The negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.
As biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.
Considering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads biomedical research has made for preventing, treating and curing human maladies, but what all Americans stand to lose if the U.S. reduces its investment in these endeavors.
 A cure for cancer

The hope and dream of curing cancer unites many scientists, health professionals and affected families across the U.S. After decades of ongoing NIH-supported research, scientists have made significant progress in realizing this goal.
The National Cancer Institute of the NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research. This investment has led to advances in cancer treatment and prevention that helped reduce the overall U.S. cancer death rate by 33% from 1991 to 2021.
Basic science research on what causes cancer has led to new strategies to harness a patient’s own immune system to eliminate tumors. For example, all 12 patients in a 2022 clinical trial testing one type of immunotherapy had their rectal cancer completely disappear, without remission or adverse effects.

Another example of progress is the 2024 results of an ongoing clinical trial of a targeted therapy for lung cancer, showing an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similarly, in a study of women who were immunized against the human papillomavirus at age 12 or 13, none developed the disease later. Since the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer deaths have dropped 62%.
Despite these incredible successes, there is still a long way to go. In 2024, over 2 million people in the U.S. were estimated to be newly diagnosed with cancer, and 611,720 were expected to die from the disease.
Without sustained federal support for cancer research, progress toward curing cancer and reducing its death rate will stall.
 Autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases

Nearly every family is touched in some way by autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Government-funded research has enabled major advances to combat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.
For example, approximately 1 in 5 Americans have arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes joint swelling and stiffness. A leading cause of disability and economic costs in the U.S., there is no cure for arthritis. But new drugs in development are able to significantly improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression.
Researchers are also gaining insight into what causes multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves and can result in paralysis. Scientists recently found a link between multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus, a pathogen estimated to infect over 90% of adults around the world. While multiple sclerosis is currently incurable, identifying its underlying cause can provide new avenues for prevention and treatment.
Alzheimer’s disease causes irreversible nerve damage and is the leading cause of dementia. In 2024, 6.9 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer’s. Most treatments address cognitive and behavioral symptoms. However, two new drugs developed with NIH-supported research and clinical trials were approved in July 2023 and July 2024 to treat early-stage Alzheimer’s. Federal funding is also supporting the development of blood tests for earlier detection of the disease.
None of these breakthroughs are a cure. But they represent important steps forward on the path toward ultimately reducing or eliminating these devastating ailments. Lack of funding will slow or block further progress, leading to the continued rise of the incidence and severity of these conditions.
 Infectious diseases and the next pandemic

The world’s capacity to combat infectious disease will also be weakened by cuts to U.S. federal support of biomedical research.
Over the past 50 years, medical and public health advances have led to the eradication of smallpox globally and the elimination of polio in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, once a death sentence, is now a disease that can be managed with medication. Moreover, a new version of treatments called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offers complete protection against HIV transmission when taken only twice per year.
Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role biomedical research plays in responding to public health threats. Increased federal support of science during this time allowed the United States to emerge with new drugs, vaccine platforms with the potential to treat a variety of chronic diseases, and insights on how to effectively detect and respond to pandemic threats.
The ongoing avian influenza outbreak and its spillover into American dairy herds and poultry farms is another pandemic threat looming on the horizon. Rather than build upon infrastructure for outbreak surveillance and preparedness, grants that would allow scientists to better understand long COVID-19, vaccines and other pandemic-related research are being cut. Decreased funding of biomedical research will hamper the U.S.’s ability to respond to the next pandemic, putting everyone at risk.
 Losses from defunding biomedical research

The National Institutes of Health contributed over $100 billion to support research that ultimately led to the development of all new drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 alone. Over 90% of this funding was for basic research into understanding the causes of disease that provides the foundation for new treatments.
Under the new directive to eliminate projects that support or use terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion, the NIH and other federal agencies have made deep cuts to biomedical research that will directly affect patient lives.
Already, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer’s. About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.
Defunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs. Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.’s health care system, economy and standing as the world’s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.
Moreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.
University shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation. Funding cuts have led to the shuttering or heavy reduction of training programs for future scientists.
Graduate students and postdoctoral trainees are the lifeblood of biomedical research. Supporting these young people committed to public service through research and health care is also an investment in medical advancements and public health. But the uncertainty and instability resulting from the divestment of federally funded programs will likely severely deplete the biomedical workforce, crippling the United States’ ability to deliver future biomedical breakthroughs.
By cutting biomedical research funding, Americans and the rest of the world stand to lose new cures, new treatments and an entire generation of researchers.

Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Health insurance for millions could vanish as states put Medicaid expansion on chopping block

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Sammy Smith/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska voters should be confident their Xs go where they are intended and are counted in the right pile. We know this from the state’s previous elections being free and fair. Yet, despite the results and the facts and the accurate tabulation of votes, tinkerers remain — those who insist a sky full of hanging chads, “2,000 Mules” and bus loads of immigrants is falling.
The hallmark of that body of nonbelievers (or true believers, whichever you prefer) is its lack of proof that elections in Nebraska — or anywhere else for that matter — are fraught with fraud when their candidate doesn’t win. No amount of verification, substantiation or confirmation convinces them. No number of losing court cases deters them.
Still, we have instances of new voter restrictions based on their beliefs.
For example, without evidence, some argued the possibility of hordes of fraudulent voters would overrun our state system, leading to a new requirement of voter ID with photos. Fair enough. Although the new requirement created very few hitches in our electoral getalongs, as we’ve noted in this space before, if a photo ID requirement disenfranchised one voter, that’s one voter too many.
Changes proposed
Apparently, Nebraska’s outstanding and secure election systems still need tweaking if one believes the basis for Legislative Bill 541. If passed, LB 542 would erect further barriers to register and vote while also somehow denying the science and data on counting votes by hand, which finds hand counts less accurate than machines. The good news is that as of this writing the bill has yet to go anywhere. Nevertheless, its introduction alone is rooted in lies that the 2020 election was peppered with improprieties and, more damaging, calls into question the integrity of county election offices, local election officials and the Secretary of State’s Office. Enough already.
Into this miasmic mix now comes a presidential executive order unnecessarily injecting the federal government into elections. Its first section, “Purpose and Policy,” relies on unproven assertions and outright conspiracy theories that the nation’s ballot boxes are being sullied with the votes of the ineligible, especially non-citizens. Those numbers are infinitesimal if at all. 
Nevertheless, the order says as a country we have failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections.” Not according to the metrics we use to measure such things.
The order came shortly after an unprecedented national security breach was uncovered, involving the administration, and the denial fiasco that followed, calling the timing into question. More problematic, however, is that the action seemed to move the federal government into a space previously reserved for states and local municipalities, countermanding or diluting their power to hold elections. 
That’s a constitutionally bad look.
Requirements clear
In case the feds are asking, here’s what it takes to register to vote in Nebraska:

Be a United States citizen.
Be at least 18 years of age on or before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
Live in the State of Nebraska.
Have not been convicted of a felony, or if convicted, have completed your sentence for the felony, including any parole term.
Have not been officially found to be mentally incompetent.

What remains to be seen is whether the order moves Nebraska or any other state to alter how it runs its elections, including the registration process, the actual voting, the processes used to tabulate the votes and the reporting of the results. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evenen recently spoke in favor of the order, if only to help election officials better identify who is a citizen. But executive orders come and go as presidents come and go. Not so acts of state legislatures and Congress, which write laws.
In the 2024 general election, 156,302,318 of us showed up to vote. That was 63.9 percent of those eligible to vote. If you’re keeping score at home, Wisconsin led the league with nearly 77 percent turnout, while in beautiful Hawaii only half of eligible voters marked their X. Nebraska was well-represented in the turnout sweepstakes with 73.9 percent. Its 934,188 was the second-most ballots ever cast in a state election.
But before we thump our chests, remember that more than a quarter of the eligibles in Nebraska stayed home. Nationally the number was more than a third. Turnout here and across the country was historically high but did nothing to dispel the usual math that a good portion of eligible voters continue to disenfranchise themselves by failing to register or to vote.
Which is why, rather than littering the voting process with hurdles and hoops and questionable executive orders, we should be spending more time, money and political capital on increasing the number of voters exercising their civic duty.

Safe storage incentive spliced with sales tax holiday for guns, accessories
A House bill that would have created a $300 income tax break for firearm safes and other safe storage devices now only applies to gun safety training.
And the bill – which had passed overwhelmingly in the House and with bipartisan support – has been spliced together with a Senate bill creating a sales tax holiday in October for the purchase of firearms, ammunition and other accessories, like scopes and magazines – as well as gun safes.
The Senate Finance Committee advanced the measure Friday.

A similar version of the Senate bill, sponsored by Dallas Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte, passed in the Senate this session with a party-line vote. The proposal originally called for an 11-day tax holiday, but it has been shrunk to a four-day window under the compromise.
The House proposal stalled largely over concerns among Second Amendment advocates that the tax incentive would create a registry or a record of who benefited from it. 
Rep. Mark Newton, an Augusta Republican who is the bill’s sponsor, said Friday that the proposal is a way to promote gun safety training in a “Second Amendment-friendly way” while also saving taxpayers money.
Democrats immediately objected.
“We took a responsible gun ownership bill and turned it into a gun proliferation bill,” Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, said after the committee vote Friday.
Republicans dismissed those concerns.
“Isn’t true if you’re going to buy a safe that you need to buy a gun to put in it,” said Sen. Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican who serves as Senate majority leader.
Not all Democrats opposed the bill, though. Sen. Michael “Doc” Rhett, a Marietta Democrat, voted for it because he said sees it as “a start.”
“Anything that will promote gun safety is a good start,” Rhett said.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, told reporters Friday that he still thought “the larger picture is being accomplished, and that’s to ensure that we have gun storage, gun safety devices that are available to Georgians.”
“I just want to see us get something done,” Burns said.
Gun safety advocates who spoke at an already-planned press conference at the state Capitol Friday blasted the compromise. Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat who has pushed for gun storage requirements, said HB 79 has been “essentially completely neutered.”
“I’m not exactly sure what this bill aims to do at this point,” Au said Friday. “I don’t know if they think that the activists who are here and the students and the families that are listening are stupid enough to think that this is action on gun safety.”
Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety, said the House measure went from a promotion of safe storage to “a tax bill related to guns and related gun products.”
“We have a problem with safe storage (in Georgia) and the fact that our Legislature, after the worst school shooting in Georgia’s history, cannot unequivocally take up some legislation to say Georgians should adopt safe storage practices – that’s a real statement of where our Legislature stands on gun safety,” Hallett said. 
House Republicans have also revived a controversial Senate proposal that targets a Savannah ordinance penalizing gun owners who leave their firearms in unlocked vehicles. If passed, someone facing a fine would be able to sue the city for as much as $25,000 in damages. That measure was added to Senate Bill 204 last week.
Database cut from high-priority school safety bill
Burns’ signature school safety bill passed unanimously through a Senate committee Thursday, but with some key elements stripped out.
One of the most controversial aspects of House Bill 268 was the creation of a statewide database of information on students who might pose a threat to school safety. That provision was removed after an outcry from parents and child advocates who worried that youthful mistakes or behaviors caused by disabilities could follow a student and harm their future opportunities.
  Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“An amazing number of parents, particularly of teenage boys, who, by definition, they are immature and compulsive and do dumb things were fearful that their child might end up having a stigma attached to them of having a record that would go with them permanently about some stupid comment, threat, or behavior they had done as a teenager when, in fact, they were really not criminal, never engaged in criminal behavior, just immature behavior,” said Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, who is sponsoring the bill in the Senate.
The bill, which is 57 pages long, still touches myriad aspects of school safety. It would require public schools to implement a panic button system and share data with local law enforcement including school maps.
It would also require schools to more quickly share data when a student transfers, a response to the Apalachee shooting in which the accused gunman had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at a different school in another district more than a year before the attack.
“You can see this is an extraordinarily comprehensive approach to addressing the known problems we have with school violence,” Cowsert said Thursday to his Senate colleagues. “And hopefully, with God’s help, we won’t have another Apalachee in this state.” 
The bill will have to go back to both the House and Senate by April 4 if it is to become law this year.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Burns was comfortable with the bill’s chances and about the database being removed from the bill.
“This is a great process we have up here,” he said. “I think we all come together, we deal with the facts, sometimes we have a little different viewpoints, and final passage of anything is never the final statement on it. So, we look forward to working with the Senate next week, and I believe they’ll get school safety across the finish line, and I know that it will offer protections for our students in Georgia for a safe learning place.”
Though the measure passed the Senate committee unanimously, some still hope to see the bill changed before it heads to the chambers.
  Rep. Michelle Au speaks at a press conference Friday. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Some child advocates say parts of the bill calling for trial as an adult for teenagers charged with making terroristic threats against a school could sweep children, especially children of color, into the justice system for youthful behavior.
Au said she is grateful that Burns is prioritizing safety in schools, but she’s disappointed the bill makes no mention of firearms despite concerns about the danger of shootings. 
“When we talked about the cell phone bans in schools, which was presented as a bill to increase student performance and concentration and reduce distractions in schools, most of the objections I heard about that bill reverted back to the argument about school safety and how are kids going to call us if there’s a school shooting?” she said.
Au was referring to House Bill 340, a ban on personal devices for students through middle school, which passed both chambers and is awaiting Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature. Several lawmakers indicated that they agree with the principle of removing cell phones in schools to increase student focus but said the idea of a child not being able to call 911 or text loved ones in case of an emergency gave them pause.
“Everyone’s thinking about it,” Au said. “I it’s a really conspicuous omission therefore to have any legislative push, an omnibus bill that has many different aspects to it addressing school safety, but to leave out the most obvious piece of it that any parent or any student will tell you is top of mind.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderUnless something out of the ordinary happens, the Georgia Legislature only meets for 40 days each year over the course of about three months.
The last day of the session is called sine die, which is Latin for “without a day,” because the lawmakers adjourn without a date set for their next meeting. The final day for this year’s session is April 4.
The buildup to sine die is always dramatic, with legislators scrambling to get their bills heard and passed. Sometimes, they can even get a little sneaky by reviving legislation that, based on procedure, should not be able to pass.
Issues important to Georgians like gun storage and school safety as well as whether diversity, equity and inclusion should be taught in schools could be decided this week. Lawmakers also still have to hash out an agreement on a spending plan for next year.
Here are some of the other major pieces of legislation to watch out for as the Gold Dome’s final countdown begins.
RFRA
Republican lawmakers have been trying for a decade to pass a statewide religious freedom bill, but those efforts have fallen short amid outcry from LGBTQ advocates.
This year, a RFRA bill – short for Religious Freedom Restoration Act – is just about as close to navigating the Legislature as it’s ever been.
  Sen. Ed Setzler presents his RFRA bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler has shepherded the RFRA bill, Senate Bill 36, through the senate as well as a couple of contentious House committee hearings. A successful vote in the House would put the bill on Kemp’s desk.
Setzler says the bill would give religious Georgians the same protections from state and local governments that they get from the First Amendment on the federal level.
Opponents say that because Georgia does not have a comprehensive civil rights law, a RFRA bill would allow business owners who have faith-based beef with LGBTQ people to refuse to serve them.
Transgender bills
Depending on how the week goes, transgender Georgians could lose the rights to play on girls’ school sports teams, obtain puberty blockers or receive gender affirming care from the state health care plan.
The session began with competing House and Senate bills aimed at protecting women’s sports by keeping transgender women out of them.
Senate Bill 1 now seems to be the more likely bill to pass. It would prevent students designated male at birth from playing on teams for girls or women from K-12 through college in both public and private schools. It would also impose gender-based restrictions on locker rooms, changing facilities and restrooms. It does not include additional measures that were originally part of the House plan that remove references to gender from state code.
  Sen. Blake Tillery. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Transgender adults who work for the state government or their dependents could lose the ability to get gender-affirming care like surgeries or hormone treatments through the state health insurance plan.
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery’s Senate Bill 39 would shut that off starting next year.
Tillery said taxpayer dollars should not go to transgender medical services.
Transgender advocates call the bill a mean-spirited attempt to gin up political support that could end up costing more money in lawsuits than it saves.
Whether or not you’re on the state health insurance plan, a specific set of drugs that block sex hormones and can delay puberty could become harder to get next year.
Savannah Republican Sen. Ben Watson’s Senate Bill 30 originally banned puberty-blocking medications outright for transgender minors but was amended in committee to make them more difficult to get. If the bill passes and is signed into law, the drugs could not be prescribed without seeing multiple specialized medical providers.
Because they were amended, SB 30 and SB 1 will need to pass both chambers to have a shot at becoming law. The state House could vote on SB 39 any time before Sine Die, which would set it up for Kemp’s pen.
Pro-LGBTQ advocacy groups have called on supporters to visit the Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to oppose RFRA and the transgender bill, which they are calling the “slate of hate”

Among them were Dianne Canales and Anna Kabir, who work at Druid Hills Primary Care, which provides gender-affirming care.
“Basically, we’re here to advocate for our transgender patients and make sure that the laws that they’re planning to pass are not gonna prohibit them from getting access to health care,” Canales said.
Canales said both SB 39 and SB 30 would affect the patients in their practice.
“We have patients both on that type of insurance and taking the hormones,” she said. “And so passing something that’s going to prevent them from getting coverage, is gonna affect our practice tremendously, but not just our practice, but our community, and our patients. It’s going to have a detrimental impact on their mental health needs.”
Sanctuary cities
Another Tillery bill, Senate Bill 21, targets so-called sanctuary cities by allowing them to be held civilly liable for crimes committed by undocumented migrants.
This has long been a goal of Republican state lawmakers, but last year’s killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia ignited calls to emphasize deporting undocumented immigrants. A Venezuelan man immigration authorities say crossed into the country illegally was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for Riley’s murder.
A bill passed last year in the wake of Riley’s death allows the state to strip funding from cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, and soon after he took office in January, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping immigration bill into law named after Riley.
Senate Democrats argued that the bill is cruel and could result in overcrowded jails and lawsuits against cities.
The House can cast a final vote for SB 21 to send the legislation to the governor’s desk.
Elections

Before the session is scheduled to wrap up Friday, lawmakers could likely pass legislation changing state election rulemaking procedures, ban the state from being a member of a multi-state voter list accuracy system and implement other voting law changes.
Last week, Republican legislators advanced this session’s most extensive election bills out of House and Senate committees, after some significant last minute changes were made that its sponsors said should alleviate some criticisms heard during public meetings.
The most sweeping measures were House Bill 397 and Senate Bill 197, which have the same proposals for restricting the State Election Board from rulemaking within 60 days of an election and banning voters from dropping off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day.
The bills also began the state’s  transition from participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, an organization that currently provides two dozen states a database to help maintain accurate voter rolls.

Brad Little vetoed a bill to ban Idaho businesses, local and state governments, private and public schools, and colleges and universities from requiring medical interventions, such as vaccines, treatment or medication.
Senate Bill 1023, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act, would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Little vetoed the bill Saturday — the first bill the Idaho governor has vetoed this year.

“Medical freedom is an Idaho value. However, this bill removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions including measles, lice, ringworm, pink eye, strep throat, stomach viruses, the flu, and other illnesses that disrupt families’ lives,” Little wrote in a transmittal letter explaining his veto.
This year, Little signed into law a bill to let Idaho doctors and health care entities refuse care that violates their beliefs. He cited that bill as one of several examples of his support of “true medical freedom in Idaho.”
“We are proud that Idaho already boasts the freest laws in the country when it comes to personal medical decisions, and we need to keep it that way,” Little wrote. “Parents already have enough to worry about while raising their children. They do not need government imposing more limitations on keeping children safe and healthy from contagious illnesses at school.”
 Bill would’ve expanded on businesses COVID vaccine requirement ban

In 2022, Little vetoed a bill that would ban Idaho businesses from requiring COVID vaccines.
“I have been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operations and employees with limited interference from government,” Little wrote in his transmittal letter explaining his veto. 
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
 Citing Idaho doctor who spread COVID disinformation, Idaho GOP chairwoman pushed for governor to sign bill

In a column published Thursday, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill. 
She referenced support for the bill by Dr. Ryan Cole, an Idaho pathologist whose Washington medical license has been restricted after state regulators found he shared COVID disinformation and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients, against medical practice, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
“In 2020 and 2021, it felt like the whole world had gone mad,” Moon wrote. “Many of us feared for the future of freedom in America. But this is 2025, and much has changed since those dark days. The American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House with a mandate to set things right. He, in turn, appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead Health & Human Services. Like Dr. Cole, RFK Jr. has long been skeptical of Big Pharma’s rhetoric and the government overreach that enabled it.”
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, in an email alert Saturday said the governor “betrayed Idaho,” arguing Little “chose special interests” over “the interests of Idaho’s families.” The group asked supporters to send form emails to Idaho state lawmakers requesting they override the governor’s veto. 
Overriding a gubernatorial veto requires two-thirds support in each chamber of the Idaho Legislature. The bill narrowly passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote, and the House passage barely cleared that two-third threshold on a 47-23 vote. 
 Bill allows limited medical intervention mandates

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.

Overlapping ‘Dental Deserts’ and Fluoride-Free Zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.
Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride Seen as a Great Public Health Achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.

Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and States Rethink Fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
 



Methodology: How We Counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)SALT LAKE CITY — Saying Utahns are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature.
Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.
“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased.

Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags.

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version.
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it.
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.”
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote.
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances.
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance.
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said.
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill.
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.”
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.”
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said.
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.”
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments.
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides.

“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground.
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.”
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”
