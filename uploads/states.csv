At Easterseals Midwest, we support people with disabilities to live independently, find meaningful employment, get support in their everyday lives, and more.
The families we support are doing everything right—showing up for work, caring for loved ones, and making sure their children get the support they need. For many of them, Medicaid is the foundation that makes it all possible.
That foundation is now under threat.
Last week, Senate Republicans introduced a reconciliation bill that proposes deep and dangerous cuts to Medicaid –  a vital lifeline for Missourians with disabilities and the people who take care of them. Rather than improving on the already harmful House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Senate proposal goes even further, jeopardizing services that help people live independently and access critical care.
If passed, this legislation would devastate Missouri’s ability to deliver home and community-based services. It would increase waitlists, reduce access to care, and leave thousands of individuals and families without the support they need. Any federal funding cut would force Missouri to reduce its Medicaid investment, placing even more strain on an already overburdened system.
At Easterseals, we support more than 20,000 people and families across the Midwest every year. We see the power of consistent care and know how fragile the progress becomes when families face bureaucratic red tape and unaffordable costs.
Let’s be clear: Medicaid is essential. It supports more than just people with disabilities. It is a lifeline for parents, caregivers, therapists, educators, and direct care workers. In rural areas and regions with limited healthcare options, Medicaid is often the only access point for critical services. When it becomes harder to access, the consequences ripple across entire communities.
The proposed federal changes would cut off care for millions. It’s projected that 576,000 children and 110,000 people with disabilities could lose coverage. That doesn’t include caregivers, undiagnosed individuals, and others who depend on the system. And while some lawmakers argue for “work requirements,” the reality is most Medicaid recipients who can work already do. These proposals add red tape that causes people to lose care. Ironically, the Medicaid work requirement could cost the economy up to 449,000 jobs.
Beyond individual lives, Medicaid supports the broader health and stability of our communities. It helps prevent costly emergency room visits, reduces hospitalizations, and supports a vital workforce of healthcare professionals and caregivers.
Missouri’s senators Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt now face a critical decision that will directly affect the health, safety, and dignity of people with disabilities and the strength of Missouri families.
Instead of making Medicaid harder to access, Congress should invest in the systems that keep families healthy, employed, and hopeful.
Medicaid is one of the most effective tools we have to strengthen families and communities. It helps children grow and learn, allows caregivers to stay employed, and gives older adults and people with disabilities the chance to live independently. Weakening that system threatens the progress we’ve made toward opportunity for all.
Missouri deserves better. Our families deserve better. Senators Hawley and Schmitt must vote NO on any legislation that cuts Medicaid.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states, including Michigan, are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm. 
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads. 
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint. 
To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects. 
In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock. 
While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill. 
The project’s public comment window came to an end on Monday. 
The states other than Michigan filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2194990747-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

(Getty Images)Six of Indiana’s public colleges and universities are cutting or consolidating more than 400 academic degree programs ahead of a new state law that takes effect this week, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE) announced Monday.
Officials said the “voluntary” changes target degree programs with low student participation. The cuts are intended to help students focus on more in-demand fields and to comply early with the new state budget, which now sets minimum enrollment and completion thresholds for all degree programs offered at public institutions.
Nearly one in five degree programs will be eliminated, suspended or merged across six institutions: Ball State University, Indiana State University, Indiana University, Ivy Tech Community College, Purdue University and the University of Southern Indiana.
Currently, the schools collectively offer about 3,400 academic programs, according to CHE. Of those, roughly 2,200 are degree programs at the associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral level. As of Monday, 408 degree programs are on the chopping block.

Gov. Mike Braun praised the move as a way to modernize Indiana’s higher education system.
“In just the past month, our state institutions have taken bold, proactive steps to increase the value of higher education for both students and families,” Braun said in a Monday afternoon statement. “This will help students make more informed decisions about the degree they want to pursue and ensure there is a direct connection between the skills students are gaining through higher education and the skills they need most.”
Examples of impacted programs include:


Indiana University Bloomington: Several undergraduate and graduate degrees in foreign languages — such as French, German, and Russian — will be suspended or consolidated.


Purdue University West Lafayette: Low-enrollment master’s and Ph.D. programs in areas like literature, microbiology and mathematics were merged or will phase out.


Ball State University: Suspended programs include an English Ph.D. program and bachelor’s in international business. exercise psychology. Multiple undergraduate education programs are also on track for consolidation.


Indiana State University: Eliminated programs include the M.A. in history and M.S. in political science.


Ivy Tech: Impacted programs include associate degrees in public safety, nanotechnology and machine repair.


University of Southern Indiana: Among the affected programs were an associate’s degree in early childhood education, the M.A. in liberal studies and an undergraduate electronic business degree.


Programs were evaluated based on enrollment and completion data. According to CHE’s latest degree reduction report, 75 programs were eliminated outright, including 68 with zero students currently enrolled. Another 101 were suspended, and 232 were consolidated or merged into other academic offerings.
The bulk of the cuts were reported at Indiana University, where 249 degree programs will be affected. Purdue University followed with 83 programs. Ball State submitted 51 programs, and Indiana State reported 11. Ivy Tech, the state’s two-year community college system, is taking action on 10 programs. The University of Southern Indiana reported four.
Students currently enrolled in any of the eliminated or suspended programs will be allowed to finish their degrees through a teach-out process, officials said.
After July 1, colleges must seek commission approval to continue offering underperforming programs that fall below statutory benchmarks.

Bob Ferguson, center, met with several statewide elected officials in June to discuss how federal funding cuts under discussion in Congress and by the Trump administration could impact the state. (Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Traditionally, most new laws passed by the Idaho Legislature would have taken effect on July 1, when the new fiscal year kicks in. However, over the past five years, legislators have increasingly been attaching so-called “emergency clauses” to bills that make them take effect as soon as they are signed into law by the governor.
Now there are a mix of laws that take effect when they are signed into law in the spring and laws that take effect July 1.
 State of Idaho prepares for new budget year to begin as revenue lags behind projections

State officials will closely monitor the process for closing the books on the current fiscal year 2025 budget. As of May, state revenue was running $141 million below the revenue projection Idaho legislators built into the budget. The state was still projected to end fiscal year 2025 with a positive ending cash balance, but that projected ending balance has shrunk from $420 million to an estimated $278 million since the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Although state officials say Idaho’s economy is healthy, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s budget office asked state agencies to internally prepare for potential midyear budget holdbacks of up to 6%, Idaho Education News reported. 
Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said that even though revenue came in below forecast, Idaho is still seeing year-over-year growth in revenue, which signals a healthy economy.
“Idaho also has 22% of general fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state,” Wolff said in a written statement June 12. “While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
After year-end budget transfers and reconciliation procedures are complete, state officials should have a better understanding of the final fiscal year 2025 budget numbers later in July or in August. 
 



 Here’s a look at five new laws taking effect this week in Idaho

House Bill 7: This bill creates a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for adults convicted of possessing less than three ounces of marijuana. Republican legislators who supported the law said it is a way to be tough on marijuana and distinguish Idaho from neighboring states like Washington, Montana, Oregon and Nevada where recreational cannabis is legal. 
House Bill 322: This bill increases the salaries for judges in Idaho. Before the 2025 legislative session, Idaho Supreme Court justices encouraged the Idaho Legislature to raise pay for judges, saying that pay for Idaho judges was among the lowest in the nation and pay was so low that many judges who announced their retirement returned to practice law as attorneys, where they could make more money. The new law raises the pay for each judicial position in Idaho by $17,000 per year. 
House Bill 205: This bill allows drivers to exceed the speed limit when they are using the passing lane to pass another vehicle on roads and highways outside of city limits with a speed limit of at least 55 mph. The law does not apply to vehicles passing on the right side.
Previously, state law allowed drivers to exceed the speed limit when they were passing on a two-lane road. The new bill adds passing lanes to that section of law. 
Senate Bill 1099: This bill provides for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for a person who has previously been found guilty of driving under the influence and is again found guilty of DUI, along with vehicular manslaughter.
Senate Bill 1141: This bill establishes a statewide ban on sleeping in public places. The law bans public camping and sleeping on public property in Idaho cities with a population of at least 100,000 people. Some nonprofit organizations are concerned the law will create additional hardships for people experiencing homelessness in Idaho.
“There’s a lot of ambiguity about how this law will be enforced locally,” said Connor O’Hora, outreach team lead for the Boise-based housing nonprofit CATCH, in a written statement. “But what we do know is that it will disproportionately affect those who have no other place to go. Our immediate focus is getting people emergency supplies and protecting their health and safety in the heat.”
Senate Bill 1144: This bill adds a new section to state law that requires that, for new and existing highway projects, existing or new bicycle and pedestrian facilities may only be improved as a secondary or collateral benefit to any highway project, or to improve safety near schools, parks or other areas designated for bicycles and pedestrians.
 One notable Idaho law takes effect a year from now

One law, House Bill 37, takes effect in a year on July 1, 2026. That law makes it so that that firing squad will become the primary method of execution in Idaho, not lethal injection. 
Idaho Department of Correction officials have previously said they have had a difficult time obtaining chemicals to carry out a lethal injection. And in 2024, the state was unable to carry out the scheduled execution of death row inmate Thomas Creech after officials were unable to establish an IV line, the Sun previously reported.

(Getty Images)Participation in Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program grew by about 8.5% in the 2024-25 school year — marking a slowdown after record-setting enrollment growth in prior years. 
Even so, state spending reached nearly half a billion dollars on the private school voucher program, according to a new report released by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE). That’s up from $439 million spent on the program during the 2023-24 school year. 
The latest round of taxpayer-funded scholarships totaled roughly $497.2 million, representing a 13.2% increase compared to what the state paid the previous year. And despite an enrollment slowdown, more Hoosier students than ever before are participating — and more schools are accepting vouchers, too.
In total, 76,067 students received a Choice Scholarship during the 2024-25 school year, up from 70,095 in 2023-24. The number of private schools participating in the program also rose, from 357 to 373.
Voucher student breakdown
The average award in 2024-25 was $6,536. Vouchers are calculated as either 90% of a student’s local public school funding or the full amount of their private school tuition and fees, whichever is less. 
But participating schools reported an average tuition of $8,369 — meaning most families still paid out-of-pocket beyond the voucher amount.
More than 54,700 students received the 90% public-funding amount, per the IDOE report. Roughly 21,300 students received scholarships that covered their full tuition.
Story continues below.
2024-2025-Annual-Choice-Report
 
More than 45% of participating private schools now charge over $7,000 per year in tuition and fees, while fewer schools offer tuition below $5,000, according to the state report.
As a result, scholarships did not cover the full cost of tuition for 54,767 students enrolled in the voucher program, meaning families were responsible for paying a combined $133.9 million out-of-pocket for school costs. That amounts to an average of $2,447 per student.
The report additionally noted that if all voucher recipients had instead attended their traditional public public schools, the state would have spent approximately $567.8 million on their education. That’s because vouchers are paid at a lower amount than public school funding.
But many students have never attended public school, meaning the state obligation is new.
The majority of voucher users in the last school year — nearly 70% — had no record of attending a public school in Indiana, an increase of about three percentage points from 2023-24. The IDOE report said the rise was likely attributed to “students who were already enrolled at their Choice school now qualifying without prior attendance at an Indiana public school.”
Retention rates are up. About 76.8% of students who used a voucher in 2023-24 returned to the program this year, compared to 64.3% the year before.


Data shows white students make up the majority of voucher users at 64.29%. Hispanic students account for 17.53% of voucher participants, while Black students make up just shy of 8.82%. Those demographics are similar to the prior school year.
The latest data further reported that the average family income among voucher recipients was $102,843 — well below the income ceiling of roughly $230,000 for a family of four, but 50% higher than the annual income for an average Hoosier family, which is estimated to be about $70,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
State spending goes up — but so do school costs
Indiana lawmakers have steadily expanded the program since it launched in 2011, making it one of the largest voucher systems in the nation — and among the first to go fully universal. 
Ahead of the 2023-24 school year, participation surged by more than 30% after state lawmakers lifted income caps to include nearly all Indiana families. 
The expansion boosted funding from $311 million to $439 million in a single year and made vouchers are available to Hoosiers earning up to 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the free or reduced-price lunch program, or roughly $230,000. Only 3.5% of Indiana families were estimated to have annual incomes above those eligibility guidelines.
The incoming ceiling was removed entirely during the most recent legislative session and allows all Hoosier families to tap into private school voucher dollars beginning with the 2025-26 academic year.
The previous two-year state budget passed in 2023 allocated more than $1 billion for Choice Scholarships. The new biennial budget, which takes effect Tuesday, earmarked more than $1.2 billion. Voucher enrollment for the upcoming school year, along with total program costs, are still to be determined, however.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Feeding images to those monitors are 160-plus cameras overlooking the central village area, less than one square mile of the reservation, including tribal administrative and commercial businesses.
There’s a good chance there isn’t another northern Wisconsin public space with such a high concentration of cameras or a staff to monitor the live images that are also recorded and stored for a minimum of 30 days.
A post on the tribe’s Facebook page by Clinton D. Isham, first revealed the extent of the tribe’s surveillance capabilities to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
“Bro, all those cameras that the Tribal police put up better pay off. Police want to do surveillance on Indians to lock us up, but can’t use them to protect us,” Isham wrote.
Isham’s comment was directed at why those 160-plus cameras at LDF didn’t record any image of Melissa Beson, 37, a tribal member who was last seen on the reservation on March 17 – the site where Beson was last seen was just outside the area of the cameras.
LDF Tribal Police Chief T.J. Bill said there’s another tribe in the Midwest interested in replicating what LDF has created as a way to improve safety for tribal members.
The significant investment at LDF in surveillance prompted the question of whether other Wisconsin tribes have also secured surveillance systems to address safety concerns and whether they are considering acquiring additional surveillance technology.
The Examiner reached  out to most of the other 11 federally recognized Wisconsin tribes about their surveillance, and along with LDF, three others responded: Oneida, Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO), and St. Croix.
Police chiefs of the four tribes said it appears that there is a high interest in using surveillance technology among the tribes, particularly a technology called Flock. 
Overall, the police chiefs said tribal members are supportive of using surveillance technology, including a reported survey by one tribe that tallied over 80% support by its members.
While law enforcement officials said the use of surveillance technology and implementation of the Flock system was broadly popular among tribal members, the expansion of surveillance capabilities has drawn controversy elsewhere in Wisconsin. 
The Milwaukee Police Department and Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department have recently been at the center of a debate about the use of surveillance cameras and Flock. 
“It is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the ACLU of Wisconsin wrote in a May letter to the Milwaukee Common Council. 
Lac du Flambeau
Bill, the LDF tribal police chief, who began working with the tribe in 2013, stated that the surveillance system was already in place when he joined the department. He said that employees of the tribe’s IT department did the wiring and placement of the cameras, mostly between 2010 and 2011.
“It was directed by the tribal government, the tribal council, who wanted it for the protection of the people, for the safety of the public,” said Bill.
Bill said he didn’t know the motivation behind the creation of the surveillance system but noted that the LDF police department has been at the forefront of using technology and was one of the first law enforcement agencies in the area that had officers wearing body cameras.
“We don’t have 24/7 coverage,” he said of the cameras being monitored by staff, “but we strategically place them (staff) during the busy times, so it all depends on what’s going on, what our crime statistics tell us.”
Besides the 160 cameras, the tribe’s casino has its own internal surveillance system, which the casino monitors, a typical feature for casinos. The nearby LDF K-12 school also has its own surveillance system, which the police department can access and monitor.
With all the cameras in the LDF police department’s inventory, Beson wasn’t recorded because she was last seen in an area where there are no cameras. Bill said there have been efforts to put up remote cameras to monitor using cellular coverage, but cellular coverage is poor in the reservation and the county.
“We can’t rely on cellular-based equipment, especially during the summertime when our population goes from 4,000 individuals to 50,000 (including tourists and seasonal residents) because everyone is on their cell phones,” he said. “The cell service is horrible here in the Northwoods, so we have to rely on something else because we tried cameras in remote locations outside of the community where we can’t hook up electricity or fiber, and it doesn’t work.”
The Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) helped LDF set up a surveillance camera on Highway 70 near a former hotel that was being used for drug sales and possible human trafficking, but because that camera used a cellular connection, it wasn’t reliable.
Bill said the tribe has used recorded surveillance video to prosecute several offenses, including a string of burglaries.
“We went through the surveillance cameras and we found a couple of different vehicles, and we located one vehicle of interest and were able to track that vehicle through town, even though it was nighttime, and we were able to make an arrest for the burglaries,” he said.
They’ve also made several drug arrests using surveillance images.
“We’re able to watch individuals who make transactions,” he said. “The cameras are so good that we’re able to see into the cars where they’re doing the deals and catch them. We see the money exchanged in the car and a package delivered to the other person.”
A live feed from the convenience store showed a man lifting his wallet out of his pants and a small baggie with a white substance falling out, which alerted one of the monitors.
“He walked out of there and didn’t realize he had dropped it,” said Bill. “We went over there and we picked it up and it was a bag of cocaine.” Later, the man was charged with possession.
The big question is, do all the cameras make people safer, and do they deter crime?
Bill said the serious drug dealers know about the cameras and stay out of that area, but there are still some who forget about the cameras or think they hide their actions, but that’s pretty difficult when there are 160-plus cameras in such a concentrated area.
“For the most part, in my opinion, it is a deterrent,” he said. “To those we have arrested and interviewed, they’ll say they are doing the crimes, the transactions, outside the area of the cameras because they are everywhere, so it is a deterrent for them not to do their activity directly in the community, so they take their criminal activity outside that area.”
Having recorded digital evidence, said Bill, helps prosecute offenses.
“You go to court and you provide the evidence, that’s a huge part, not only to help with the investigation but also to protect the officer from allegations.”
Bill said there is support for expanding the surveillance system. This summer, the tribe is looking at using recently laid fiber optic lines to expand the system, allowing cameras to provide coverage of the more rural areas of the reservation such as where Beson was last seen.
Bill said there haven’t been complaints from tribal members over a lack of privacy or a “Big Brother” complaint about being observed by authorities when they are in the village area of the reservation.
“You get a complaint here and there, but it’s very few,” he said. “We don’t get the Big Brother concern. Overall, the community is in support of it.”
Oneida Nation
Eric Boulanger is the chief of police for the Oneida Nation in Northeast Wisconsin near Green Bay.
According to Boulanger, Oneida has a Security Department that is part of the tribe’s gaming commission that monitors cameras in parking lots outside the casino and several different businesses and buildings, and the school has a security department that monitors cameras within the school that the police also have the ability to access.
Over two years ago, Oneida also invested in four Flock cameras for use by the police department, which uses cameras and computers to record and track license plates. With Flock, Oneida has also integrated with the larger Flock system, which allows for searching and tracking vehicles in other communities.
Boulanger said what drove the investment in Flock is the positive reports from other local law enforcement.
“It’s a great law enforcement tool in general, not just for Oneida but any community that uses them,” said Boulanger. “It’s a fairly advanced system, and you’re able to search for vehicles and plates and that sort of thing. It lets you know if what you’re looking for is in your area.”
He added, “If you have an incident and you have any sort of vehicle description or if you have a suspect and you know their vehicle information, you can enter that into the system and then it’ll give you feedback on whether or not that vehicle was in your area.”
He added, “If you’re looking for a white Ford Bronco, you can put those parameters in there, and then they’ll show you pictures of those vehicles in a particular area.”
He was asked if the four Flock cameras are sufficient to cover the reservation.
“In the future, we may expand it,” he said. “Everything comes with a cost. They’re not real affordable, but you know where we have them placed, and with the other agencies in the area and the ability to use theirs, there’s pretty good coverage right now of our main thoroughfares, and highly trafficked areas.”
Asked if the surveillance cameras and Flock cameras help deter crime at Oneida, he said, “Well, you would think they would, but there are still plenty of people doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing.” 
“The cameras aren’t hidden, so it’s quite obvious and it’s posted, the areas under surveillance, “but people still do what they’re going to do. So, I mean, I would imagine it would deter some people, but obviously, it doesn’t deter everybody.”
He noted that recorded footage is very useful in the prosecution of a crime.
“Jurors and judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys like to have video,” he said. “It’s kind of hard to dispute a claim on either side if there is video.”
Boulanger hasn’t heard objections to the surveillance cameras or Flock.
“I haven’t heard any specific comments, nobody has directly addressed concerns with me about it, but I feel our community is pretty public safety cautious, so I think they’re probably more on the side of in favor of it than anybody would be against,” he said.
Lac Courte Oreilles
The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indian Tribal Chief Susie Taylor said the tribal police doesn’t have a surveillance system of cameras operated by the police department or a special security department. Still, police have used footage from the casino for investigations, and the K-12 school does have its own surveillance system of cameras.
She notes that former chief of police Tim DeBrot was instrumental in securing Flock cameras for the tribe, which were placed earlier this year.
Taylor said the Flock cameras record and track information about vehicles, but they will not be used for speeding violations. She said the primary use is in the investigation of crimes.
In March, Taylor put out a press release about the Flock cameras that was printed in the Lac Courte Oreilles News:
“Flock cameras are designed to enhance public safety by capturing objective evidence, including license plate information, to help law enforcement prevent and solve crimes. These cameras do not use facial recognition and are not intended for traffic enforcement. Instead, they serve as a valuable investigative tool to identify stolen vehicles, locate missing children and adults, and deter criminal activity.”
In the press release, Taylor noted that the data from the cameras is stored and then deleted after a certain number of days if it is not being used in an investigation, and access to the information is limited to “authorized personnel” and not used for “surveillance or tracking individuals without cause.”
She also noted to the Wisconsin Examiner that the Flock cameras, by tying into the larger network of cameras, allow for the sharing of information across jurisdictional boundaries.
“Many other law enforcement agencies across the country have implemented Flock cameras due to their effectiveness in reducing crime and enhancing community safety,” she said.
She noted there are Flock cameras off the region’s major highway, Highway 53, located in Washburn County, that would be very effective in helping track a vehicle that had been on the reservation in Sawyer County.
Joe Morey, public relations director for LCO, said a survey of tribal members had been conducted regarding the use of surveillance technology, and over 80% of respondents were in support.
St. Croix
Of the four tribes, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians has the least investment and deployment of surveillance equipment.
According to police chief Donnie Holmes, in 2014-15, the St. Croix Tribal Police Department began using body cameras.
Holmes said his office will place stand-alone cameras to address individual complaints or for investigations.  As an example, he mentioned that there were complaints at the Sand Lake basketball court and parking area, where robberies had occurred, so cameras were installed on the assumption that the criminals might return.
Individual tribal businesses have their own security system for recording video that could be used for an investigation or prosecution.
“Super expensive,” Holmes said of the cost of implementing a surveillance system for St. Croix similar to LDF’s or even Oneida’s. He said for St. Croix it would be even more of a challenge in that the reservation is located in pockets of land over four different counties: Burnett, Barron, Douglas and Polk.
However, St. Croix is exploring the acquisition of Flock cameras. The biggest factor against proceeding is the cost.
Holmes appreciates the capability of Flock cameras, especially for integrating with other Flock cameras to track a suspect’s vehicle. If a vehicle can be identified, Holmes believes Flock cameras would be helpful locating a missing person.
“The nice thing about Flock is they can alert to car movements with other cameras tied to the system,” he said.
Holmes was asked if tribal members would have any objections to having a more advanced surveillance system, and he noted that there is some interest in investing in technology, but he also wonders if there would be objections over privacy rights if a surveillance system became too expansive.
Flock
Holly Beilin, director of communication for Flock, said in Wisconsin three tribes are using Flock cameras and in the United States 24 tribes have it, but because of confidentiality, she cannot identify which tribes have it.
Boulanger, the Oneida Nation chief, was asked why he thinks tribes are showing an interest in Flock cameras.
“With technology it’s a useful investigative tool,” he said, “And if you know any tribal agencies or tribal nations that have independent police departments and can fiscally handle the cost, it is probably going to look towards some sort of Flock or surveillance system just because that’s the trend right now in law enforcement, using technology.”
Beilin objected when told that at least two of the police chiefs said the Flock system is pricey.
“We typically hear it is much more cost-effective than other solutions,” she responded.
One of the big issues across Indian Country is missing and murdered indigenous women and relatives. The Flock cameras can be especially helpful for missing persons because they are automatically tied to Amber Alerts for children and Silver Alerts for seniors.
Beilin said Flock is working on incorporating the new federal alert for Native Americans, called Missing and Endangered Persons (MEP), which will be implemented later in 2025 and will be known as Turquoise Alerts.
“If a vehicle is associated with an Amber Alert, the license plate passes a camera in real time and will alert local law enforcement, so that law enforcement know, like, OK, that vehicle just passed this camera and is going in this direction, so it’ll be, you know, at this location, in five minutes,’” she said, “and they can actually go, hopefully, and apprehend that person.”
However, she noted that those who use the Flock system don’t have to tie into the larger network of Flock cameras and instead can  just use them locally. She also noted the local user is responsible for how long information is stored.
“No customer has to share,” she said. “So if a tribe wanted to share with local law enforcement nearby, they could, and if they wanted to just have their own police get those alerts and use it for investigations. That would also be fine,”
She was asked what is Flock’s appeal for tribes.
“It actually works,” she said. “It solves crime, and it helps find missing persons. I mean, we just really see that as soon as the cameras are installed, it starts to actually help these agencies or these tribes. You know, the vast majority of crime has some kind of a vehicle involved, right? Which makes sense. We all literally drive daily, and as do folks who commit crime.”
As for whether the Flock system infringes upon privacy rights,“We don’t own the data, the agencies or the tribes do, so they can choose what to do with it,” she said. “We can never sell it or share it without their permission. They can set or legislate their own retention period, so maybe they only want to keep the data for. Our default (to erase data collected) is 30 days, but it could be even less.”
Cameras in the Southwest 
Sergio DeSoto is a consultant from Arizona who works with tribes in the Southwestern areas of the United States on surveillance systems. He said that most tribes he has worked with invest in camera security after an incident has raised safety concerns.
“We hear, ‘we want to make sure our people are safe,’” he said.
DeSoto said surveillance cameras are typically requested for housing, administration, courts, and border security, and most tribes have staff who live-monitor cameras.
The safety concern can be over external issues like sex trafficking on the reservation, or internal issues of domestic disputes or alcohol or drug-related issues.
He said the No. 1  motivation for the tribal nation he deals with is personal safety.
“They’re not interested in the assets; they’re more interested in the people,” he said.
Typically, he said, there is an issue or an incident that drives a discussion about how to raise safety at a particular location, such as a homicide in tribal housing. Once the surveillance system has been in place for a while, the tribe often requests help focusing on other areas on the reservation.
DeSota said the tribal councils are also learning the importance of educating tribal members before implementing a new surveillance system.
“With the elder center in Quechan (Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe in Yuma, Arizona), the tribal council did a super good job communicating with them that we want to make sure everybody’s safe,” he said.
Regarding the question of whether surveillance cameras help deter crime and increase safety, DeSota said he doesn’t have any data to support that contention. However, he noted that when tribes consistently seek to expand their systems, it would indicate that they are receiving positive feedback.

He's staying -- for now -- but, like many business owners, is worried about the impact of the law.","Victor Bencomo, an IT specialist at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow in California, updates a desktop in this 2017 file photo. Critics of Maryland's new tech tax worry about its impact on small firms wonking on Defense conrtracts, among others. (Photo by Keith Hayes/U.S. Marine Corps)When Maryland first announced its new 3% sales and use tax on data and information technology services this spring, Jake Stokes felt his business had no choice but to leave the state.
But after the Maryland Comptroller’s Office issued more guidance on the new regulations, including that pre-existing contracts would be exempt from the tax, he decided to stay. For the time being.
“We started to feel good — or at least that we bought time,” said Stokes, president of the Maryland-based government subcontractor Belay Technologies.
Depending on what regulatory decisions the state makes regarding the implementation of the tax, though, Stokes said he is ready to move the company to Texas — where he already has several employees.
Stokes is one of many Maryland business leaders expressing concern over the impact of the state’s new tax on data and information technology services and software publishing. Some said the tax will hurt Maryland’s economy more than any revenue it will generate.
The new tax, which took effect Tuesday, is expected to generate about $480 million in revenue for the state in its first year, with the amount approaching $750 million by fiscal 2030. The tax will apply to a range of businesses, including computer systems design, software publishing, data processing and hosting, and other services from news to libraries, internet publishing to web search portals.
New ‘tech tax’ dominates list of laws that take effect July 1, start of fiscal 2026

In a statement Monday, Gov. Wes Moore’s office defended the taxes, saying the governor worked with the Maryland General Assembly this session to turn the projected $3 billion budget deficit into a $315 million budget surplus, while still providing 94% of Maryland residents with a tax cut or no change in their income taxes.
Moore said that after “years of economic stagnation … Maryland’s economy is finally moving again. In just two years, Maryland has added over 100,000 jobs, more jobs than the previous eight years—which has recently been driven by private sector growth.”
That progress is “only possible” because Moore and other state and local leaders passed legislation that “will grow Maryland’s economy and ensure the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” the statement read.
Grason Wiggins, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s vice president of government affairs, agreed that the state needs more economic growth. But he said the tech tax will only serve to make the state less economically competitive with its neighboring states.
“This tax is going to make it more difficult for us to attract businesses,” Wiggins said. “It’s going to make doing business more costly here in the state of Maryland.”
The tax won’t just affect business owners, Wiggins added. Because of the broad range of services included under the tax, the cost will be passed down to consumers through increased prices of services and goods, he said.
Wiggins added that he has seen some companies indicating they are planning to leave Maryland, and has spent the last two months pleading with them to stay.
The only way to solve a budget deficit, Wiggins said, is to generate more economic growth.
“This may have plugged a hole,” he said. “But from a long-term perspective, if it drives businesses away, if it reduces job creation and limits spending, then from a long-term perspective, it’s really just moving the issue down the road and not really solving the problem.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some politicians, such as Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), have also voiced their concerns over the tax. Crosby, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, said it will have a “heavy impact” on defense contracting, one of the state’s emerging sectors.
It’s not an abstract concept to Crosby, the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense Department IT contracts: At the height of the debate over the tech tax this year, he acknowledged that he moved his business to Virginia because he did not think it could survive if he had to pay the tech tax in Maryland.
He added that he is worried about the impact it will have on other small businesses, particularly minority-owned, women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Larger contractors will have no incentive to work with smaller businesses outside of “set aside” contracts, he said.
Karen Syrylo, a Maryland-based certified public accountant, said she has heard complaints with the new tax for two main reasons: complicated legislative wording and complicated implementation.
The tax’s legislative wording is too confusing as it uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), a standard used by the federal government to classify types of businesses, to define services that fall under the tax, rather than creating its own definitions, she said.
Syrylo added that it has also been complicated for businesses to install the systems necessary to ensure that the vendor and purchaser are subject to tax.
She said tax will affect an “entire universe of purchasers.”
“Every business and every individual who buys any of these dozens and dozens of services are going to be paying more tax to their vendors,” Syrylo said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3705942-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, less than half know that most of their neighbors feel the same.
The post Wyoming warming to climate change reality and worried about water, UW poll finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming residents are feeling the heat, and they’re more concerned than ever about what it means, particularly for water — a scarce commodity in the arid state.
The state is historically among the most skeptical in the nation when it comes to embracing climate change, but a new University of Wyoming survey reveals that attitudes are changing even with an economy heavily reliant on fossil fuel extraction.
The vast majority of residents, 86%, “believe that climate change is happening,” according to the Wyoming Survey on Climate, Water, and People. Though they’re split on the reasons for it, with 47% believing it’s natural and 39% acknowledging humans are the cause, the survey helps confirm that Wyomingites are increasingly concerned. Back in 2014, for example, just 55% of Equality State residents believed climate change was happening, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. 
This graph depicts support for various water conservation policies. (University of Wyoming)
“That’s a huge change in 10 years,” said Kristen Landreville, lead author of the survey. Despite being split on the cause, “there is concern,” she added. “There is worry and there is a desire for action.”
Water concerns
It’s difficult to determine exactly why more Wyomingites are acknowledging climate change these days, Landreville said. Though the topic is constantly in the news, it likely has more to do with personal observations and local issues — particularly when it comes to water and past experiences with drought.

A University of Wyoming survey found that 39% respondents believe climate change is due to humans. (University of Wyoming)
In fact, the survey purposely led with questions about water before asking about climate, Landreville said. Whether it’s those in agriculture who rely on water or recreationalists who fish and boat, people notice variations in Wyoming’s seasonal pulse of water, which has been changing.
The survey found that 82% of respondents agreed that “Wyoming is at risk of changing water resources,” and 75% believe “it is wise and necessary to adapt to these water changes.”
It also showed broad support for various water conservation measures, including water reuse, voluntary water conservation in agriculture and a close look at industrial use. Respondents also said they trust their neighbors in agriculture more than industry officials when it comes to a clear-eyed view of Wyoming’s water risks, according to Landreville.
“Only 7% of our respondents trusted industry to tell them the truth about what’s going on with water in the state,” she said. “What’s interesting is that Wyoming ranchers and farmers were the second most-trusted group.”
Feeling alone, but not actually alone
Perhaps the most exciting results of the survey — at least for a social and communication researcher like Landreville, she admitted — is that Wyomingites vastly underestimate how much they agree on their growing climate-related water concerns, as well as a desire to do something about it. 
Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, fewer than half believe their neighbors feel the same way, according to the survey.
That massive disconnect, Landreville said, can drive a “spiral of silence” that leads to inaction and less pressure on elected officials to implement solutions. However, knowing there’s more agreement than residents previously realized is a huge opportunity to spur action at the local and state levels, she added.
“There’s more support [than understood] for creating community response plans,” Landreville said. “There’s more support for addressing water changes than Wyoming residents think. An implication of these findings, I think, is that it’s really important to share with people, ‘You know what? You’re not that different than your own community.'”
The survey, conducted by the University of Wyoming’s Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation, was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. You can view an interactive report on the survey here and read the full report here.
The Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation will be conducting more focus groups and community discussions around these issues in the near future, Landreville said.

The federal lawsuit fails to demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters, attorneys for Gray argue. 
The post Gray asks court to toss case challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Secretary of State Chuck Gray asked a federal court Friday to dismiss a lawsuit against Wyoming’s new voter registration law, arguing in two filings that the complaint does not sufficiently demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters. 
Once the law goes into effect Tuesday, proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship will be required to register to vote in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group made up of several nonprofits, filed a lawsuit in May after the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications” during the 2025 session. 
The complaint alleges the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written and will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters. 
The harms described in the complaint, however, are speculative and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court, Gray’s attorneys argued in Friday’s filings. 
“Plaintiffs liberally assert these broad, sweeping claims, without bothering to submit supporting evidence,” attorneys with Dhillon Law Group argue. 
“For example, they have not identified even one woman, one Hispanic citizen, one impoverished individual, one transgender citizen, or one person with epilepsy who cannot vote because Wyoming wishes to enforce the citizenship requirement embodied in both federal and state law. Nor can the plaintiff offer any method to reliably measure the likelihood or extent, if any, of such hypothetical difficulties in Wyoming.”
The law was a key priority for the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Gray, whom the complaint names as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks. 
“Wyomingites deserve fair, transparent elections and that’s why we are fighting tooth and nail to protect these election integrity measures,” Gray said in a Monday press release. 
The case’s profile has risen considerably since it was first filed, attracting high-profile attorneys who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage. Ahead of Gray’s filings on Friday, the Republican National Committee filed a motion to intervene in the case while a coalition of 25 states plus Guam filed a proposed amicus brief, urging the court to allow the law to go into effect.

Legal fight
Shortly after Equality State Policy Center filed its complaint, attorneys for the group sought a preliminary injunction, asking the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
Gray responded with two motions — one asking the court to allow the law to go into effect, another asking that the complaint be dismissed entirely. 
In the first filing, attorneys for Gray argue that ESPC has not demonstrated that the law will impose a severe burden on the right to vote, and that Wyoming has a compelling interest in enforcing current federal and state laws that limit voting to U.S. citizens. 
“Plaintiff’s request to preliminarily enjoin HB 156 — without evidence of actual harm, and well in advance of any election — is both premature and legally unfounded. Therefore, the motion [for a preliminary injunction] should be denied,” the filing states. 
Attorneys for Gray fleshed out their argument further in a motion to dismiss, arguing the plaintiff does not have standing, or the right to bring the lawsuit,   for three reasons.
The first centers on a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
ESPC argued in its complaint that the new law will impede its “core work of encouraging voters to register and participate in their democracy” and would require the group “to redirect significant resources to increase its voter registration education efforts.”
But when several anti-abortion groups challenged the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and subsequent actions regarding mifepristone — arguing it forced them to conduct their own studies of the drug — the high court ruled that did not give them standing. 
“In short, increased educational efforts or advocacy efforts are not a concrete, particularized injury that establishes standing,” Gray’s filing argues.
Second, Gray’s attorneys say the plaintiffs failed to identify anyone who will be harmed by the law. 
As part of its legal strategy, ESPC included several affidavits from individuals explaining potential harms of the new law, including the organization’s executive director, Jennifer DeSarro, as well as representatives from both a homeless shelter and a food pantry, both in Cheyenne. 
“Despite Plaintiff’s claims of widespread harm, it has only identified one member organization that claims harm to its members,” Gray’s filings state, pointing to an affidavit from the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. (Emphasis from the filing.)
“But this sole member has failed to meet the requirements” to have standing, the filing argues. 
“Third, to the extent Plaintiff argues its members’ members will face injury, such injuries are speculative, at best, and, thus, cannot serve as a basis for Plaintiff’s standing.”
Equality State Policy Center now has until July 9 to file a response.

USDA Secretary in Santa Fe announces agency intends to repeal Clinton-era ‘roadless’ rule

But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.

Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Public pushes back on land sell-off proposal from Utah senator

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”

But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role in managing public lands

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other Trump administration proposals slash environmental rules and expand logging, mining

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.













The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers





“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“If you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Caregivers for people with developmental disabilities may see boost to a living wage, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Even Freedom Caucus lawmaker sees need for supporting Wyoming’s developmental disabilities program appeared first on WyoFile .","I never dreamed I would hear a conservative Wyoming lawmaker boldly proclaim that a social safety net program is “one of the reasons why we have government.”

Opinion

Such enthusiasm in the Wyoming Legislature is generally reserved for subsidizing the fossil fuel industry or bringing an expensive project to a legislator’s district. A favorite tactic of far-right politicians is to portray themselves as budget hawks by railing about social programs that the state and federal government shouldn’t waste taxpayers’ money on.
So when Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, strongly came out in favor of the state significantly boosting the budget of the Medicaid developmental disabilities waiver program last week at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting in Gillette, it genuinely startled me. I’m on the opposite end of the political spectrum, but he’s spot on in his assessment that the program “is something that’s absolutely worthy of supporting and worthy of doing right.” 
A state study last year recommended adding $12 million to the Department of Health’s budget to increase the reimbursement rate for more than 570 providers who care for about 2,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or acquired brain injuries in home and community-based alternatives to an institution.
Unfortunately, while a steering committee published the report, it didn’t recommend forwarding the funding request to the Legislature. The committee said a low response rate to a provider survey resulted in the decision.
The Department of Health, the Legislative Service Office and many providers are correcting that problem, giving the Appropriations Committee stacks of white papers and promising to compile more.


The Legislature’s Management Council approved Appropriations’ request to make the issue a priority during the interim. The committee will meet Aug. 19-20 in Dubois, with a trip to a developmental disabilities provider tentatively on the agenda.
Pendergraft could have played it safe and tried to please the Freedom Caucus, which endorsed his candidacy last year. But he chose to speak his mind on an issue he obviously feels passionate about.
I don’t know if the Freedom Caucus will take an official position on the disability waiver program in 2026, but I do know that after it took control of the House earlier this year, the caucus killed a $2.4 million a year raise in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for maternity health care requested by Gov. Mark Gordon and the Department of Health. The proposed higher disability waiver reimbursement rate is a similar issue for a vulnerable population that’s about five times more expensive.
Pendergraft, like the majority of Republicans in the House, voted against the rate increase for maternity care.
Pendergraft has a very personal reason for his position on the waiver issue. He explained that a man who belonged to his church suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident when he stopped to help a stalled motorist. The family lost its income and had astronomical medical bills, he said, so about a dozen church families helped his wife start a business.
“[The congregation] made tremendous sacrifices,” he recalled. “We paid the bills, we provided care for this individual, who needed constant care day and night.”
Jaded from years of hearing lawmakers contend almost every social problem, from juvenile delinquency to teen pregnancies, can be solved by putting it in the hands of churches instead of throwing public money at it, I wondered if Pendergraft was going down that well-traveled road. But he didn’t.
The legislator told the committee he and his wife provided care for a relative at their home for several years until she moved to a group home, and a co-worker who had a developmentally disabled child needed more help than the state could provide.
Citing his experience working at a nursing home and the long hours he spent helping the three families, Pendergraft said that state and federal governments, which split the costs, should reimburse providers at a level that will help them pay private caregivers competitive wages.
Daryl Skinner, executive director of Lincoln Self Reliance, agreed. He said staff turnover hurts the quality of care.
“The average length of time for direct care staff is six months,” he said. “Can you imagine having to retrain employees every six months? It’s a revolving door.”
Skinner said caregivers have to pass a medication training program, and medication errors increase with staff turnover. He added it takes time for new workers to learn how to interact and communicate with individuals who may be nonverbal and aggressive.
“People say, ‘I love this work, it’s the most meaningful experience I’ve ever had, but I can’t afford to pay my living expenses,’” Skinner said. “We pay an average wage of $16.81 an hour. Fifty percent of our workforce commutes to Jackson Hole, where dishwashers are paid $25 an hour.”
Though Pendergraft said he definitely wants to see waiver reimbursement rates raised, he also showed he’s not above playing some political games to accomplish that goal. 
“Before I sit down and authorize a $20-or-$30-or-$40 million check, knowing that taxpayers are already sacrificing, I want to look across the breadth of the Department of Health,” Pendergraft said. “ If it considers this to be a high priority, what’s it willing to sacrifice to pay for it?”
Pendergraft said the state only has a limited amount of money. “If you’re going to fund [higher DD waiver rates] you do it right, and you pay people what they should be paid,” he said. “And when you run out of money, you stop the spending.”
Stefan Johansson, the Department of Health’s director, had a diplomatic response. While he said he’s always open to looking at places to trim, his department had three rounds of budget cuts in the past dozen years that were “all north of $100 million.”
The state has increased funds when it could, like in 2023, when the Legislature added $6.3 million for higher reimbursement rates for providers and $7.4 million to reduce wait times for people who need disability waivers. Currently, the average wait to obtain services is about 14 months.
Johansson didn’t spell it out directly, but I detected a clear message: The state has made a lot of budget cuts in main programs, including Medicaid waivers, developmental preschools, mental health and substance abuse services at community mental health centers, and 24/7 facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital and Wyoming’s Life Resource Center. 
These programs are either required to be offered under federal law or part of lawsuit settlements. They account for more than 90% of the department’s biennial budget. If someone wants to cut a lot of “fat,” there aren’t many places to look.
Appropriations Committee Co-chair Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, had some encouraging words for Johansson.
“I know the challenges you face with limited dollars. I believe you’re doing everything you possibly can on this issue, given the budget that you have, and so I appreciate your efforts; I appreciate your attention,” Salazar said. “I’m not positive, but I tend to think help is on the way.”
That’s not a promise, but given the Legislature’s desire to cut budgets, it’s about as hopeful a sign as can be expected six months before the next session.

It’s a sad commentary on the power of the right-wing misinformation machine in modern America that simple and enormously positive concepts like diversity, equity and inclusion have been twisted so that some perceive them in a negative light.
What’s next on the hit list? Words like love, tolerance and common ground?
Tragically, however, as North Carolina Republican legislators made clear last week, they’re serious about this perverse crusade – so serious that they recently passed legislation that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion in state government.
The bill is so ill-conceived and poorly written that it would likely prohibit state agencies from recruiting employees at women’s colleges and HBCU’s.
Even programs to help accommodate the needs of veterans and people with disabilities would likely be unlawful.
The bottom line: The sponsors of this legislation claim that their attacks on DEI are about promoting equal opportunity. In truth they’re about promoting three words that are the opposite of DEI – call it UIE: uniformity, inequity and exclusion.

As Anita Wolfe sat in the hallway of a Charleston, West Virginia, county courtroom, waiting to testify against the U.S. government, she thought of her dad, who first started working as a coal miner when he was around 12.
She remembered his wild stories about coal-loading contests and working as a mule boy. But she also remembered his death certificate, which listed black lung and silicosis, two pulmonary diseases related to dust in mines, as contributing factors.
Before she retired, Wolfe launched and ran a mobile clinic through the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that screened miners at their mines and tried to catch lung diseases early.

In April, as part of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, around 90% of NIOSH staff received layoff notices. Many were placed on administrative leave — including the mobile clinic crew, workers who review miners’ test results and researchers trying to prevent these lung diseases in the first place.
Wolfe was in the courthouse to try to get those jobs back. Now, her mobile clinic workers are back, along with all the other workers in the institute’s Respiratory Health Division. But researchers elsewhere in NIOSH who also work on prevention are still slated to be laid off. 
To Wolfe, that’s a problem. About a fifth of the coal miners in Central Appalachia have black lung, Wolfe said. And from 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 died. Nationally, a 2023 NIOSH study found that coal miners are twice as likely to die of lung diseases than nonminers. Wolfe called black lung and silicosis “entirely preventable.” 
“It comes down to how much is a life worth,” Wolfe said. “You want more coal, but you don’t care about the coal miners and what’s happening to them.”
*   *   *For some coal miners, pausing the black lung programs at the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health created an immediate problem, because without a stamp of approval from the institute, coal miners can’t access federal “Part 90” benefits that allow them to get reassigned to jobs with less dust exposure. 
Black lung has no cure, but avoiding dust can stop the disease from getting worse. With the pause, X-rays and medical records now sat in folders, unexamined. 
So Wolfe and others began campaigning, collaborating with public health workers and miners to try to get the NIOSH workers back. Wolfe enlisted the support of West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who successfully petitioned to get black lung workers off administrative leave in the short term. Still, that was just a temporary fix.
Sam Petsonk, a lawyer, and Harry Wiley, a coal miner, decided to sue the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIOSH. “To me, he was very courageous for doing that,” Wolfe said of Wiley. 
At trial, Wolfe and Wiley were both called to testify, and on May 7, they sat with other witnesses in the courthouse hallway. For hours, the group made small talk about kids and summer vacations, scrupulously following instructions to avoid any chatter about the department’s “reduction in force.”

One by one the witnesses entered the courtroom. Wolfe was last. “Everything was going through my head,” she said. She was nervous. But then, she remembered her dad. “I just felt like he was there with me, you know? Kinda egging me on, like, ‘You got this, baby girl.’”
When Wolfe took the stand, she was calm, and described the value of NIOSH’s programs. The defense, she said, “didn’t offer much defense at all.” 
After the trial, Wolfe joined Wiley and Petsonk for sandwiches. “They seemed fairly confident that it was gonna be found in favor of the miner,” she said. 
A few days later, the judge ruled in Wiley’s favor. Staff at the mobile clinic and the broader National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health Respiratory Health Division got their jobs back for now, although the program is still working to get back up and running. Staff at the institute’s National Personal Protective Technology Lab were also called back; they certify a variety of respirators that help keep miners and other workers safe.
But other institute researchers working to prevent mining-related lung diseases heard nothing. 
While researchers in the Respiratory Health Division focus primarily on tracking disease and helping individual miners, researchers at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh and Spokane Mining Research Divisions focus on innovation, developing new tools to prevent disease in the first place.  
The judge’s preliminary injunction said the law requires that kind of research. But the injunction did not explicitly put Pittsburgh and Spokane researchers back to work.
The Department of Health and Human Services did un-fire their boss, a statutorily required associate director overseeing the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research. But it did not bring back the hundreds of researchers who report to that administrator.
“He’s new. He hasn’t even met us yet!” said Cassandra Hoebbel, a NIOSH researcher in Pittsburgh and a union steward for the Association of Federal Government Employees. 
“A lot of people contacted me and were like, ‘Oh my God, you got your job restored!’” she said. “It’s like, no they’ve only restored a tiny part of it.”
Hoebbel said that mine health and safety research at the institute has been mostly on pause since January due to the Trump administration’s restrictions on funding and travel. For almost five months, researchers have been unable to visit mines to measure dust levels, test new equipment or improve software tools. 
That’s a long-term loss for miner health, but it’s a short-term loss as well: NIOSH field work often leads to quick-fix changes by the mine operators the researchers collaborate with. Now, those improvements aren’t happening. External grants for technology development and commercialization were also “terminated for convenience.”  
That’s despite the fact that, after a long decline, lung diseases in miners are again on the rise: Black lung cases have been increasing for two decades, according to a 2018 NIOSH study, and severe cases have caught back up to their all-time high. And it’s not just black lung. A 2023 study found that coal miners are dying of a variety of lung diseases at higher rates than in the past. Some are also dying younger.
*   *   *“It used to be that people said black lung was an old man’s disease, and that’s not true. We just buried a thirtysomething miner,” Wolfe said.
Many younger miners suffer from lung diseases caused not by coal dust but from quartz dust, officially called respirable crystalline silica. As coal deposits became tapped out, mines went after harder-to-reach coal, generating more quartz dust from the surrounding rock. Modern mining machines may also contribute to the dust. 
Silica dust exposure is not unique to coal miners, who represent a small sliver of miners in the U.S. Silicosis is common in miners at all sorts of mines. 
While coal workers are eligible for “Part 90” transfers and benefits based on dust exposure, those who mine for sand, rocks, precious metals and other material are not. 
For all miners, silica dust protections are decades out of date. After Wolfe’s mobile clinics helped identify new clusters of lung disease, a 2014 rule lowered allowable limits for coal dust exposure. Similar standards lowered limits for silica dust in industries like construction.

But a rule to lower by half the silica dust exposure limit in mines stalled for a decade. The rule finally passed in 2024 — then a 2025 start date was postponed, after pushback from mine operators, who said implementation would be too difficult.
Mine operators objected to a final version of the rule that said it was not enough to implement a check list of “good enough” dust control measures, to give miners masks or to rotate them in and out of dusty areas to reduce their exposure. Instead, the final rule says mines need to actually reduce the hazardous dust.
The rule also mandates silicosis monitoring programs, similar to Wolfe’s black lung monitoring work, but for non-coal miners.
However, the same day President Donald Trump held a press conference promoting the “abandoned” coal industry, the Department of Labor postponed the rule’s upcoming start date for coal mines from April to August. (Stone mines still have until April 2026 to comply.)
Earlier this year, the Department of Labor announced plans to close 34 of the mine enforcement offices that work to hold mine operators accountable for the current silica dust standard. In late May, those plans were reversed.
*   *   *Dust is a constant presence in mines, and it lurks in overlooked places. Currently paused National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health research has the potential to improve the dust problem. 
Decades ago, government mine safety researchers identified controls that could be used to reduce dust in mines, such as improving ventilation. 
But mines have been using those strategies for years, and lung diseases stubbornly persist.
Traditionally, mine inspectors check dust levels a few times a year to confirm compliance. But those checks don’t provide much actionable information about how to make things better. That’s frustrating for mines and for miners. So NIOSH has been working on ways to make dust easier to spot.
Their personal dust monitors already let miners view their own mine dust exposure in real time. Other projects are helping miners make sense of that kind of data.
In 2015, Hoebbel observed field work for an award-winning study by institute researcher Emily Haas that outfitted miners with both a dust monitor and a video camera and then compared the feeds to see why dust levels spiked.
“They had two guys walking side by side,” Hoebbel said. One of their dust monitors “kept going up, up, up — and the other guy was walking right next to him and his was fine.”
The researchers, curious, asked, “When’s the last time you washed your sweatshirt?” Hoebbel said. “He’s like, ‘Oh man, I can’t tell you the last time I washed this thing!’” 
Before the study, the participating miners felt confident that wearing masks and following established procedures would keep them safe. Afterwards, they were full of questions about silica exposure. The mine in the study, for its part, replaced cloth vehicle seats and gloves with leather, which is easier to wipe clean. 
But attaching monitors to miners, while good for sussing out dirty sweatshirts, is less effective for tracking dirty equipment or faulty ventilation, which may be getting dust on sweatshirts in the first place.

So another institute project used air quality monitors to help mines and miners better understand sources of exposure within mines. In a recently published pilot study, weekly reports of real-time data helped staff at sand mine notice minute by minute shifts in dust at key locations. 
As a result, the mine’s industrial hygienist turned some machines on before miners arrived for the day, so they wouldn’t be exposed to an extra burst of dust that spiked when machines were starting up. 
A foreman also noticed a dust hot spot near a particular conveyor belt and used parts they had on hand to come up with a fix, reducing dust in the area threefold.
The approach is promising, and NIOSH has a history of creating useful gadgets for miners that are now widely used and often legally required. From October to January, those researchers made several site visits. Then, nothing. 
That project is currently paused, along with much of NIOSH’s other research into silica exposure and impacts.
Many dust monitors test general dust levels; teasing out silica in particular means distinguishing one speck of dust from another. So researchers were working to make same-day infrared spectroscopy tests more accurate. Others were developing continuous, real-time silica monitoring tools. 
Mining researchers were also collaborating with the NIOSH chemistry team to understand exposures to silica in nano-clay, or particles of clay minerals. But the institute’s analytical chemists are all still facing layoffs. So are the researchers trying to address all the other hazards miners face. 
Federal mine safety and health research began in earnest in the 1910s, around the time Anita’s father was born. Back then, hundreds of coal miners died each year in mine explosions. 
NIOSH and its predecessors made those incidents rare. But mine risks keep evolving: As mines age, for example, massive sinkholes can appear, and institute researchers have been helping mine operators predict them. 
They are also studying ways to keep lithium batteries from exploding, working to understand if a growing number of natural gas wells could leak explosive methane into mines and devising ways to better prepare miners to survive accidents using virtual reality and to prevent accidents involving giant haul trucks. 
All of that work is now on pause. 
*   *   *
Wolfe hopes that the Department of Health and Human Services will restore NIOSH researchers voluntarily. A recent Health and Human Services draft budget for 2026 includes stable funding for mining research, even though researchers are not currently working.
In the meantime, the fate of their work could be determined by another court case, this one brought against the Trump administration by plaintiffs including Hoebbel’s union, the American Federation of Government Employees. 
It’s among several lawsuits that allege that by cutting funding and staff without authorization, the administration’s DOGE initiative has usurped the powers of Congress. 
Many institute layoffs were previously scheduled for June 2. But several days before, a judge issued an injunction putting the layoffs on pause until that case is adjudicated. The Trump administration has appealed that injunction to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
At issue is whether Congress has the right to commit to generational goals, like the health of miners, that require stability as executives come and go.
For Wolfe, the answer is obvious. “I always tell people: ‘I’m not gonna argue with you about whether coal is good or bad. But as long as it’s mined and there are coal miners, we need to take care of them.’”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments



But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In Colorado, 12.3 people died by gun suicide per 100,000 residents that year. In total, 27,300 people in the U.S. died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.

Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
In April, the Colorado governor signed into law Senate Bill 25-3, which sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.

Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
As USDA announces plans to repeal ‘roadless’ rule, ND has 250,000 acres that could be affected

Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Tony Evers delivers his 2025 state budget address. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers and Republican and Democratic legislative leaders have reached a tentative agreement on the 2025-27 state budget, agreeing to invest hundreds of millions in the University of Wisconsin system, to create new grant and payment programs for child care facilities, further boost investment in special education and cut $1.3 billion in taxes.
The deal comes after months of negotiations (and multiple breakdowns in communication) among Evers and Senate and Assembly leaders. Each leader highlighted pieces of the deal in statements.
Evers focused on the investments in education and child care, saying it is “a pro-kid budget that’s a win for Wisconsin’s kids, families, and our future.” 
“What was at stake is no secret — Republican lawmakers had long indicated this budget would not invest in child care providers, would provide no new increases for our K-12 schools, and would cut nearly $90 million from our UW System. But I never stopped believing we could work together to reach consensus and pass a bipartisan budget, and I’m proud of the months of work that went into getting to where we are today,” he said. 
Evers thanked Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) for coming to the table to get a deal done. 
“The people of Wisconsin expect their leaders to show up, work hard, and operate in good faith to get good things done,” Evers said. “We’ve shown we’ve been able to get good things done for Wisconsin when people put politics aside and decide to work together to do the right thing. I look forward to signing a bipartisan budget that makes these critical investments in our kids, families, and communities across our state,” Evers said. 
Evers has also agreed not to utilize his partial veto power — previous uses of which have been both limited and sustained by the state Supreme Court in recent weeks — on parts of the budget included in the deal.
Vos said in a statement that he appreciated Evers’ willingness to work with lawmakers to find a bipartisan agreement.
“This budget delivers on our two biggest priorities: tax relief for Wisconsin and reforms to make government more accountable,” Vos said. “This deal brings those investments and reforms together and creates a Wisconsin that works for everyone.” 
JFC co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said legislators worked hard to find compromise while staying “committed to our core principals.” 
“We are proud to have worked diligently to craft this budget, listened to the priorities of our constituents and look forward to sending the bill to [Evers] later this week,” Born said. 
LeMahieu and budget committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement that tax relief for middle-income Wisconsinites has been their top priority during the entire process.
“This compromise will provide meaningful tax relief for retirees and the middle class, stabilize the child care system without making pandemic-era subsidies permanent and strengthen our schools by reimbursing special education at a higher rate,” the Senate leaders said. 
Hesselbein  said she has “been at the table fighting hard on behalf of Senate Democrats to help hammer out a bipartisan budget agreement.” Her involvement in negotiations comes amid slim margins in the Senate. 
“Remember where we were a week ago: Republicans proposing $87 million in cuts to the UW, a mere 5% increase for special education and no direct payments to child care providers. Elections matter: the fact that Democrats gained four Senate seats and are close to taking the majority means that Senate Democrats were able to make this budget agreement better for the people of Wisconsin,” Hesselbein said.
Last session, the state Senate passed the budget bill with only Republican votes even after a couple of Republicans voted against the proposal. This session the Republican Senate caucus would only be able to lose one vote if it were going to pass the bill with only GOP support, yet, even prior to a deal announcement, a handful of Republican members had publicly expressed concerns about the spending in the bill. Among them was Sen. Steve Nass who, in a statement last week, laid out requirements for a budget that he could support, Sen. Rob Hutton who, in a Friday opinion piece, and Sen. Chris Kapenga who, in a post on Monday, drew their own lines in the sand.  
It is unclear how many Senate Democrats will vote for the budget when it comes to the floor this week. Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) earlier told WISN UpFront that the caucus was sticking together and members were “not willing to be picked off one by one.”
The Joint Finance Committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday to vote on the rest of the budget before sending it to the full Assembly and Senate. 
Child care funding 
Child care providers, who have dealt with staffing shortages, high costs and declining state support, will receive a $300 million investment under the deal.
Evers had proposed spending an additional $480 million to continue funding Child Care Counts, a program that was funded using federal pandemic relief. With that funding running out, Evers had said the state should pick up the costs to continue supporting child care providers, while Republican lawmakers said they were opposed to providing checks to facilities.
Under the deal, the Child Care Counts program will be phased out, but the state will invest $110 million to support direct monthly payments and monthly per-child investments to child care facilities for a bridge program. That will continue helping providers to remain in business, cut child care wait lists and lower costs for families. The money will come out of the state’s federal interest earnings. 
The state will also invest $66 million in general purpose revenue for a “Get Kids Ready” initiative, which will be targeted at supporting child care providers serving 4-year-olds. This will be the first child care program in state history to be funded solely by general purpose revenue. 
Another agreed-upon budget item creates a $28.6 million pilot program to help support child care capacity for infants and toddlers. 
Under the program, providers are to receive $200 per month for every infant under 18 months and $100 per month for every toddler between 18 and 30 months.
Other child care investments include a $123 million increase in the Wisconsin Shares program, $2 million over the biennium for the creation of a competitive grant program aimed at supporting child care facilities seeking to expand their capacity and $2 million in Wisconsin’s Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies to help parents find child care and provide training to providers.
The deal also makes changes inspired by solutions that Republican lawmakers have advocated for including creating “large family care centers” that will be allowed to serve up to 12 children and standardizing the minimum age for an assistant teacher in a child care facility at 16. 
No cuts for University of Wisconsin system 
The University of Wisconsin system will get an investment of more than $256 million in the state budget under the deal — a significant compromise as Evers and the system had requested an $855 million investment, while Republican leaders in recent weeks were considering an $87 million cut to the system. Evers had threatened to veto the budget if it came to his desk with a cut. 
The funding includes $100 million to support UW system campuses statewide. Some of the funding would be distributed to campuses according to a formula. Of this, $15.25 million each year would be distributed to campuses with declining enrollment over the last two years and $11.25 million each year through a formula dependent on the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
There will also be $7 million across the biennium to provide 24/7 virtual telehealth mental health services across UW system campuses, $54 million to support retainment and recruitment of faculty and staff, $94 million to increase wages by 3% in the first year and 2% in the second year for UW system employees and $1 million for UW-Green Bay’s Rising Phoenix Early College High School Program. 
The UW system will also be required to maintain the number of positions funded with general purpose revenue and program revenue at January 2024 levels. 
The system will also get over $840 million for capital projects. Other parts of the capital budget, including the Green Bay Correctional Institution, were addressed in the deal. 

$194 million for UW-La Crosse to complete the construction of the Prairie Springs Science Center and to demolish Crowley Hall 
$189 million for UW-Milwaukee to renovate the Health Sciences and Northwest Quadrant complex
$137 million for UW-Oshkosh to demolish a library facility, renovate and add a brand-new replacement addition 
$10 million for UW-Madison to renovate and build a new addition to Dejope Residence Hall 
$98 million for UW-Stevens Point to renovate and build a new addition to Sentry Hall
$800,000 for UW-Milwaukee to plan for renovations at Sandburg Hall East Tower 
Nearly $32 million for UW-Stout to renovate and build a new addition at its recreation complex
Nearly $19 million for UW-Madison to renovate the Chadbourne Residence Dining Hall, $5 million to plan for relocation and demolition of the UW-Madison Humanities Building and $160 million for renovation of UW-Madison’s Science Hall

K-12 special education funding up to 45% 
The deal also makes changes to the budget that Republican lawmakers on the budget committee passed in mid-June, boosting the special education reimbursement rate to 45% by the second year of the budget. 
The state’s special education rate was one of the crucial issues discussed by education advocates with many saying a significant investment would help alleviate some of the financial stress schools have faced and ease districts’ reliance on property taxes. 
Some advocates had called for a 90% investment, while Evers proposed a 60% rate. Republican lawmakers had initially approved raising the rate to 35% in the first year of the budget and 37.5% in the second year. 
Under the deal, the total investment in the special education reimbursement will be over $500 million. The rate will rise to 42% in the first half of the biennium and 45% in the second. It will remain at a sum certain rate, meaning the amount of money allocated is finite and will not increase based on expanding demand. 
The budget deal will also invest $30 million for comprehensive school-based mental health services.
Department of Health Services changes
The deal would also increase the hospital assessment rate to help maintain the state’s Medicaid costs. The Wisconsin Hospital Assessment is a levy from certain hospitals that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) uses to fund hospital access payments, hospital supplemental payments and reinvestment in the Wisconsin Medicaid program. 
Wisconsin hospitals currently pay an assessment rate of about 1.8% of their net patient revenue to the DHS. That would rise to 6% under the deal with 30% of the funds being retained in the Medical Assistance Trust Fund, which supports Wisconsin’s Medicaid program. The rest of the funds will be used to invest in hospital provider payments and is estimated to provide over $1.1 billion in additional investments in Wisconsin hospitals. 
The changes use federal funding to increase hospital reimbursement while decreasing the amount of general program revenue for the Medicaid program.
Evers’ office noted that federal reconciliation legislation proposals have included provisions that would prohibit or limit the policy change in the future, meaning that this budget could be the last for Wisconsin to make these types of changes.
The state will also fund the current Medicaid program under the deal. 
The budget will also increase investments in free and charitable clinics by $1.5 million.
The deal does not include Medicaid expansion, which Evers continued to advocate for in the budget but Republican leaders have fervently opposed. It also doesn’t include the smaller postpartum Medicaid extension, which would allow postpartum mothers to receive Medicaid coverage for up to a year after giving birth. 
Wisconsin is one of 10 states not to take the Medicaid expansion and one of two not to take the postpartum expansion. 
Roads improvement program gets additional investment 
A couple of projects created in the last budget to help with road improvement will get additional funding under the deal
The state will allocate $150 million in the Agricultural Roads Improvement Program, which was created in 2023 to support local agricultural road improvement projects statewide. Of the additional funding, $30 million will go towards improving and repairing deteriorating bridges across the state.
According to Evers’ office, the program has so far funded 92 projects across the state. 
The deal would also generate nearly $200 million in additional revenue to improve the sustainability of the transportation fund, allocate $14 million for municipal service payments, invest $50 million to continue the Local Projects Program (also created in the 2023 budget), which supports local communities with construction projects that serve statewide public purpose, allocate $15 million for repairs and modifications to the Echo Lake Dam, invest $5 million for the Browns Lake dredging project and invest $30 million for the De Pere railroad bridge.
$1.3 billion in tax cuts
Evers has also agreed to support the tax cuts that lawmakers approved in committee in mid-June. 
Under those changes, more people will qualify for the state’s second tax bracket with a rate of 4.4%. For single filers, the qualifying maximum income will increase from $29,370 to $50,480. For joint filers, the maximum will increase from $39,150 to $67,300 and for married separate filers, the maximum will increase from $19,580 to $33,650.
It’s estimated that this will reduce the state’s revenues by $323 million in 2025-26 and $320 million in 2026-27.
The cut will affect 1.6 million Wisconsin taxpayers and provide an average cut of $180. Under Wisconsin’s tax system, people pay the first-bracket tax rate on the portion of their income that falls into that bracket, the second-bracket rate on their income up to the maximum of the second bracket and so on. Thus even high-income earners will get a tax break through adjustments to the lower bracket rates.
The proposal also included an income tax exclusion for retirees. It is estimated to reduce Wisconsin’s revenues by $395 million in 2025-26 and $300 million in 2026-27. This will allow Wisconsinites 67 and older to exclude up to $24,000 for single-filers and $48,000 for married-joint filers of retirement income payments. Those filers will see an average cut of about $1,000 per filer.
The deal will also include the elimination of the sales tax on household utility bills, which is estimated to cost the state about $178 million over the biennium and create a film tax credit similar to one that Republican lawmakers have been advocating for.

Jay Reedy confirmed he is running for the 7th Congressional District seat set to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
Reedy, an Erin Republican, said he filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to enter the election and could announce his candidacy this week.
Green is planning to leave the post after voting on President Donald Trump’s spending plan, creating an opening for a host of candidates in a special election to be scheduled this year. 
Reedy is the latest Republican to say he will run for the seat, a position he said he wants to fill in an effort to cut federal bureaucracy and support Trump’s policies. Reedy testified for federal prosecutors in the April political corruption trial against former House Speaker Glen Casada and his top aide, Cade Cothren, who were convicted on nearly 20 counts of conspiracy, fraud and kickbacks.
In his sixth two-year House term, Reedy said he has been bothered by the federal government’s slow reaction to flood damage in Waverly in August 2021 where 20 people died and the community lost two school buildings. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $20 million to replace the schools, but FEMA required Waverly to resubmit paperwork, delaying work on the projects.
In addition, Reedy said the U.S. Department of Education should be eliminated because of its expense, roughly $268 billion, about $2.6 billion of which is sent to Tennessee. He also questioned environmental enforcement on farmland across the state.
“The federal government needs to stay out of Tennessee’s business,” Reedy said, adding he signed numerous lawsuits against the Obama and Biden administrations.
Other Republican candidates for the post are former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, and Springfield resident Jon Thorpe and Jason Knight of Clarksville.
Van Epps recently announced his leadership team with car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, serving as honorary co-chairs. Alex Joyner, who managed Green’s re-election campaigns in 2022 and 2024, will serve as campaign manager, and Rachel Barrett, another Green staffer, will lead finance operations. 
No Democratic candidates have announced yet they will run.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed the state’s massive operating budget, which includes funding for a new Cleveland Browns domed stadium and provides tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is a developing story and will be updated. The governor will have a press conference at 10 a.m. Tuesday on his decisions.
At 11:15 p.m. Monday, DeWine announced he approved the about $60-billion Republican spending bill. As of 1:30 a.m., he was only midway through scanning his 67 line-item vetoes, spokesperson Dan Tierney said.
So far, we know several items approved in the budget.
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium.
The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget will give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away — and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
The budget also changes a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Income tax
He also approved the GOP’s 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions.
Medicaid
Tierney confirmed that some aspects of the Medicaid cuts, ones that were set to cut about 800,000 Ohioans off of health care, have been signed into law. Other provisions were vetoed, he said.

Thom Tillis (R-NC) listens during a Senate Judiciary Hearing on June 18, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Republican Senate committee members held the hearing to discuss the alleged cover up of former U.S. President Joe Biden’s health and decline. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)From the beginning of his tenure in the North Carolina General Assembly, it’s always been evident that Thom Tillis was not a true right-wing, authoritarian extremist.
Arch-conservative – especially on matters of taxes and economic policy? Yes. Ready to pare the social safety net to the bone and “divide and conquer” the various groups of people who find themselves relying upon it to maintain a semblance of economic security? Certainly. Happy to ram through a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while forecasting that its demise was inevitable? Sure. Willing to swallow his pride and abandon basic personal values on a regular basis in order to assuage an above average case of political ambition? Absolutely.
But a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool, Trump and Putin-loving, immigrant-hating, LGBTQ-bashing, white/Christian nationalist MAGA-believer? No way.
Like a lot of modern conservative Republicans, Tillis has certainly blown with the winds that overtook his party the last couple of decades. And he’s probably embraced a number of positions and policies that he would have found surprising back in his early 40’s, when he commenced his political career by running for a local park board position in order to champion a public bike path.
But as he made clear on multiple occasions while serving in the North Carolina House and during his 10-plus years in Washington, Tillis’s political values and instincts were and are much more in line with the rapidly withering Bush/McCain/Romney branch of Republicanism than the Trump-as-flawless-Dear-Leader cult. While he regularly caved in to the demands of the bully-in-chief and his hench-people (on immigration, on foreign policy, on advancing unqualified buffoons to court seats and cabinet positions), you knew they were always moves of calculated – some would say cowardly — political expedience. The Trump people knew this too and clearly never trusted him.
This past weekend, Tillis finally reached his limit. Faced with voting for one of the most monstrously destructive legislative proposals in American history — a bill that will wreak havoc on his state and further empower a man who openly aspires to become a national dictator – Tillis made clear there was a limit to how far down the Trump cult rabbit hole he was ultimately willing be dragged. By voting against the president’s disastrous mega-bill and then quickly announcing his decision not to seek reelection next year, Tillis appears to have taken a big step in officially severing ties with the sect and recapturing a small sense of who he is and what he believes as he contemplates his final 18 months in office.
Of course, as mental health experts will attest, leaving a cult — like overcoming an addiction — can be a complicated, up-and-down process. This is especially true for disillusioned former true believers.
Fortunately, in this case, Tillis’s departure seems more akin to that of someone who knew all along that they needed to get away from a controlling and abusive leader, but just hated the thought of being ostracized by the community they so long inhabited and the ideals that many members of the group still nominally professed – not to mention giving up a position of political power.
But as other Republicans like former Congresswoman Liz Cheney have discovered, there can be life beyond the cult. What’s more, and this is important, unlike Cheney whose time in Congress almost immediately ended after she bravely dared to cross Trump, Tillis is now a free man with a full year-and-a-half left in office to do and say what he believes, and maybe just maybe, to convince other disaffected Republican lawmakers who know the emperor is naked to, at least occasionally, join him.
Indeed, with partisan margins so razor thin on Capitol Hill, Tillis now has the opportunity to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina since Sam Ervin helped spearhead the demise of Richard Nixon a half-century ago.
For instance, as University of Richmond law professor and judiciary watcher Carl Tobias told NC Newsline Sunday, now that he’s free from reelection concerns, Tillis is well-positioned to stymie some of Trump’s looniest court nominees from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee – a body in which the GOP holds only a 12-10 advantage.
If only Tillis had had his epiphany before caving on the execrable nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary.
Could all of this be wishful thinking? Maybe.
Blood runs thick and Tillis has already taken to social media to say that he wants a Republican to win his seat next year. But given the state of the North Carolina GOP, that will ultimately mean supporting a craven Trump toady who will be commanded to specifically condemn Tillis, so who knows how enthusiastically he’ll stick to that stance?
Whatever the state of Senator Tillis’s psyche at what is no doubt a difficult personal moment, he’s clearly come to a fork in the road on the overriding issue of our times: Trumpism. In one direction lies the rocky path of strength, honor, morality and making an important difference for the nation’s future that would be long remembered. Down the other lies the path of acquiescence, personal ease and comfort, and utter political and historical irrelevance.

At right is a copy by Mary Katherine Goddard printing, 1777. (Rhode Island State Archives)Honor the history behind Independence Day with a visit to the Rhode Island State Archives for a once-a-year showing of the state’s trio of copies of the Declaration of Independence.
The special holiday display will be open for visitors from 9 a.m. to noon on Friday, July 4, at the State Archives on Broad Street in Providence, Secretary of State Gregg Amore announced in a statement on Monday. 
“The State Archives are the keepers of three beautifully-preserved pieces of American history – Rhode Island’s copies of the Declaration of Independence,” Amore said in a statement. “I hope Rhode Islanders and visitors alike will take advantage of this opportunity to see our history up close.”
The event marks the only day of the year that all three documents will be publicly displayed in the state archives. During the rest of the year, the public can view the copies by making an appointment with archives staff, who can retrieve the documents from their storage space.
This year’s display also features a new, banner exhibit explaining the background of each of the copies of the country’s founding document. 
The oldest of the trio, the Southwick Printing, is one of roughly 200 copies printed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, immediately following the approval by Congress that same day. Then-Gov. Nicholas Cooke received Rhode Island’s copy two days later, according to the Department of State. A local printer for the Newport Mercury, Solomon Southwick, was also paid to reproduce the document to give to the state’s town clerks.
Six months later, in January 1777, a second printing of the Declaration was authorized through Connecticut printer Mary Goddard. Unlike the prior iteration, the second round publicly identified the names of each document signatory. A third, stone engraving of the same document was ordered in 1823, with 200 printings shared with surviving signers, government officials and departments, and higher education institutions.
Also part of the state’s July 4 exhibit: a newly authorized portrait reproduction of the First Rhode Island Regiment, a group of 130 Black soldiers who joined the Continental Army in 1778, and were immediately freed upon enlistment. The formation of the regiment marked the first and only time a state government offered freedom in exchange for service during the Revolutionary War, according to the Secretary of State’s office.  
The original “Brave Men as Ever Fought” portrait by Don Troiani was displayed at the Rhode Island State House from March to June, but is now en route back to its home at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. The state’s authorized copy will be traveling to various locations throughout the state in 2026, including the State House, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office, said in an email.
The State Archives houses more than 10 million letters, photographs and other important state documents in its home at 33 Broad St. in Providence. More information is available online at https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/state-archives.

Kelly Ayotte legalizes high stakes tournaments and slot machines such as these shown at a casino in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images)The two budget bills signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte Friday are sprawling — House Bill 2, the policy bills, has 162 pages of new laws. And many of the budget’s changes have already graced headlines, inspired protests, and set off debates in State House committees. 
Observers may know about the budget’s “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban for K-12 students, the end to New Hampshire’s yearly auto inspections mandate in January 2026, or the premiums added to Medicaid recipients that would charge $90 per month for a household of three. 
Other provisions,  however, may have fallen through the cracks. Here are eight changes in the budget that you might not have heard about.
Medicaid changes
In addition to the new premiums, the budget includes other changes to New Hampshire’s Medicaid program that will affect who can participate.
To start, it includes a renewed push for a work requirement. House Bill 2 requires that the Department of Health and Human Services apply for a waiver to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in order to impose a work requirement. 
That waiver application must first be approved by the state’s Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a powerful panel of senators and representatives — before DHHS can send it to the federal agency. Then, if the Trump administration approves, New Hampshire’s work requirement will take effect.
The budget also fully restores the income verification process for Medicaid that had been in effect before COVID-19. Those verifications, which required participants to provide annual income verification, were suspended from 2020 to 2023.
And it directs DHHS to apply for a federal waiver to increase the prescription drug copay for Medicaid recipients to $4. 
Aside from the cost and eligibility changes, the budget also directs Medicaid to pay for new services.
It allows the state to include name-brand drugs on its preferred drug list for Medicaid participants, allowing the program to pay for name-brand medication in the rare cases that it is cheaper than generic equivalents.
It instructs state officials to use Medicaid funds to “accelerate the implementation” of the state’s at-home dialysis program.
And it tells the state to implement an incentive program to encourage beneficiaries to receive outpatient procedures, such as ambulatory care, in a “lower cost” setting.
The “Momnibus 2.0” bill
The budget delivered one victory for health care advocates by including a bill known as “Momnibus 2.0.” The bill seeks to improve maternal health by targeting maternal depression and common health problems that follow giving birth. 
The goal: to reduce the prevalence of deaths of new mothers caused by postpartum substance use disorder and mental health crises.
Momnibus 2.0 requires health insurers in New Hampshire, including Medicaid, to cover maternal mental health screenings during well-child visits after pregnancy. Those screenings would occur at the child’s 1-month, 2-month, 4-month and 6-month check-ups.
The bill requires insurance and Medicaid to cover home visiting services for pregnant and postpartum women. It also mandates that employers provide those people at least 25 hours of leave from work in the first year of the child’s life to attend such appointments. And it sets up and funds a state psychiatric hotline for pregnant and postpartum women, beginning in July 2027. 
Betting and gambling changes
Throughout the budget, there are some provisions that expand gambling and betting in the state. But there are also portions that seek to help mitigate its effects.
For instance, the budget legalizes both video lottery terminals and high-stakes tournaments, a move that has provided a key revenue source for the rest of the budget. 
Video lottery terminals are machines that allow players to wager cash, credits, vouchers or tokens for games of chance, such as digital slot machines. And high-stakes tournaments are games of chance in which the required buy-in is $2,500 or more. The latter may be used by licensed operators under the state’s charitable gaming law. 
The expansion has prompted lawmakers to grow the scope of the agency overseeing these games: Under the budget, the New Hampshire Lottery Commission will be renamed to New Hampshire Lottery and Gaming Commission, and will oversee the new games.
At the same time, the budget includes some provisions designed to address gambling addiction. It directs the Lottery and Gaming Commission to contract with an organization to create a “voluntary statewide self-exclusion database.” That would allow people to choose to bar themselves from all forms of legal gambling in the state; the budget directs the commission to design specific rules for how it would work.
A fix for special education funding
After New Hampshire’s state special education fund ran out of money in 2024, prompting Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut to warn schools about potential cost increases, lawmakers have been attempting to prevent future shortfalls.
One example can be seen in House Bill 2. The budget bill holds that if the special education fund falls short of fully funding the amount that school districts are owed, the fund will be required to fund at least 80% of what school districts were owed. The budget also empowers the governor to request additional money from the general fund to fill that special education fund and meet that 80% requirement. 
But not all special education funding fixes were added. During the budget writing process, the Senate took out an increase in per-pupil state funding for public school students receiving special education that had been passed by the House, drawing criticism from some advocates.

A state film agency?
New Hampshire has been the backdrop to a handful of successful movies, including the 1995 Robin Williams movie “Jumanji” to the 1981 Katherine Hepburn film “On Golden Pond.” Some lawmakers are interested in bringing the state further onto the silver screen. 
Currently, the New Hampshire’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs runs a web page with resources for studios looking to film in the state. That website includes information on how to obtain a permit to film on local roads and highways, how to shoot in the White Mountain National Forest, and how to connect to location scouts for specific needs.
But the budget would contemplate whether to create an entire office dedicated to film and creative media — as well as whether to pass a tax credit to incentivize more films to be set here. House Bill 2 requires that a panel of one senator and two representatives meet between now and Nov. 1 to produce recommendations.
A number of states have passed similar tax credits or enticements, such as Georgia, New Mexico, Illinois, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and California. 
Court-appointed attorneys for involuntary admissions hearings
House Bill 2 increases the state’s obligation to provide legal counsel to people who are fighting their involuntary commitments to hospitals and psychiatric facilities. 
Previously, state law held that a person being involuntary committed is entitled to an attorney to represent them in a hearing to overturn that commitment, and may be provided a public defender if they are unable to pay for one.
The budget updates that language to require the state to provide an attorney for anyone who is in that position and does not have a lawyer, regardless of whether they can pay for it. And it states that the funds for those attorneys — as well as any investigators or experts needed to help with that person’s case — should be paid for out of the state’s indigent defense fund. 
Year-round emergency services for substance abuse
Included in the budget is $10 million over the next two years that will allow DHHS to provide year-round emergency shelter to people suffering from opioid use disorder. That money will come from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund, which contains money the state won in settlements against opioid producers such as Purdue Pharma. 
Mobile driver’s licenses
House Bill 2 instructs the Division of Motor Vehicles to create a mobile driver’s license in New Hampshire. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, the agency will begin offering the “electronic credentials” to those who have attained physical driver’s licenses; it will also set a fee for them. 
Even with the new credentials, a driver will still need to have their physical license on their person while driving a vehicle, the statute clarifies. But the mobile licenses could potentially be used to verify identity or age in other environments, such as bars. 
The budget also requires the DMV to begin offering non-driver’s identification cards to residents who qualify.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)University of Virginia president Jim Ryan’s abrupt resignation in the midst of federal pressure on the school to end its DEI initiatives set off a firestorm of controversy, with Virginia Democratic lawmakers now pledging that they will find ways to prevent further politicization of higher education. The lawmakers said they’re reconsidering legislation to support governing boards and reevaluating the gubernatorial appointments process.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

Democratic legislators started speaking against the impetus of Ryan’s resignation soon after he announced the news Friday.
“It’s just outrageous,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville. “I don’t know that this sort of thing has ever happened before, where the federal government has reached down, totally around the governing structure that a sovereign state has set up for governance of its universities, and has forced this sort of change.”

On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell said his colleagues are exploring all options to navigate what they framed as questionable higher education decisions made by President Donald Trump, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and their administrations, including reviewing the governor’s multiple appointments to college governing boards.
“We’ve been getting calls to stand up from people all around the commonwealth, and we have to look at these people very carefully and decide where to confirm them,” Surovell said. “When we come back in January, reform is going to be on the table, because we cannot afford to ever let this happen again,” Surrovell added, in reference to the upcoming legislative session.
The New York Times first reported that the Department of Justice claimed that UVA had merely rebranded its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts instead of eliminating them as mandated by Trump’s executive order, which warned of federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
UVA’s governing board was the first in the commonwealth to dissolve its DEI initiatives and Virginia’s efforts to challenge DEI efforts ramped up under the Youngkin administration.. 
In January 2022, Youngkin renamed the state Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion through an executive order by replacing“equity” with “opportunity,” contrary to state code. Then in April 2023, Martin Brown, the office director appointed by Youngkin, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the Virginia Military Institute.
“Let’s take a moment right now to kill that cow. DEI is dead,” Brown said. “We’re not going to bring that cow up anymore. It’s dead. It was mandated by the General Assembly, but this governor has a different philosophy of civil discourse, civility … living the golden rule, right?”
In January 2022, the governor also eliminated DEI-driven education programs at the Virginia Department of Education through an executive order by striking down “divisive concepts” in school curriculum.
Ryan’s resignation marked an unprecedented development for university leaders, a coalition of whom condemned the “Trump administration’s political pressure campaign” leading to Ryan’s exit.
“We view this campaign as an egregious attack on the independence and integrity of public higher education in Virginia,” Timothy Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement Monday.
Also on Monday, Ross Mugler, acting president & CEO of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and a governing board member at Old Dominion University, said in a statement that the incident at UVA is not an isolated one; but a growing threat for all institutions.
“Governing boards and institutional leaders across the country must treat this moment as a wake-up call,” Mugler wrote. “Now is the time to reaffirm your board’s unwavering commitment to institutional autonomy, academic freedom and governance integrity. Boards must stand united with their presidents in the face of politicization, external interference, and efforts to erode public trust.”
In a letter to the UVA community on Friday, Ryan wrote that his resignation was “an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.” 
 Response from Republicans

Republican leaders have largely stayed quiet following Ryan’s resignation, except for John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
“Good. That’s what happens when you stick your middle finger up at the elected governor and the voters of Virginia and then play a game of chicken with the president of the United States on an issue that’s overtly reverse racist like DEI,” Reid wrote on social media Saturday.
He also claimed that Ryan has “presided over the decline of the honor system” at the institution.
“The great University of Virginia deserves leadership that will help it to regain its reputation as a place of high personal standards and robust intellectual curiosity and debate instead of a standard issue incubator of biased and emotional anti-American thought,” he wrote, warning other university leaders to take note that “DEI is dead” and they “better start being honest and fair with students and taxpayers if you want to keep your job.”

Ryan had faced recent criticism about his leadership and calls for him to step down from some segments of the UVA community.
On May 15, the Jefferson Council, a UVA alumni organization, urged UVA’s Board of Visitors to find new leadership at the institution, taking out a full-page advertisement in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
“The damage to UVA’s values and traditions is not theoretical—it is palpable and measurable, and is the result of leadership that has failed the entire University community,” said Joel Gardner, president of The Jefferson Council, in a May 15 statement.
The advertisement alleged there were multiple leadership failures under Ryan’s tenure, which “undermined the University’s integrity and founding ideals.”
The council said a deadly shooting in 2022 that took the lives of three students and wounded two others was mishandled under Ryan’s watch, and that his administration enabled the “worst outbreak of antisemitism” in UVA’s history. 
However, Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, refuted the Jefferson Council’s claims in a public letter, saying the alumni group compromises the institution’s leadership and reputation through partisan attacks.
“They say they want to restore Jefferson’s vision, but their approach undermines the very ideals of free inquiry, reasoned debate, and honor that Jefferson championed. Their tactics — lies, personal attacks, and public disrespect — stand in direct opposition to the honor code and the values that define UVA,” the group wrote. “We want to set the record straight: UVA is thriving — and the overwhelming majority of alumni are proud of the progress being made under President Ryan’s leadership.”
 Looking ahead

Senate Democrats have fought against Youngkin’s influence over governing boards at Virginia’s institutions by rejecting some of his appointments from confirmation. However, the governor’s administration contends that until the General Assembly confirms the appointments in January, they can still serve.
Democrats are now challenging that in court, in a case they hope will determine if leaders at three of Virginia’s universities broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees to remain in their governing boards.
The lawsuit targets the leadership of the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia and George Mason University.
Surovell said the Senate may also reconsider a proposal from last year’s session that Youngkin vetoed, which would have redefined the authority of governing boards within public universities regarding their legal affairs. The proposal would have given the boards the authority to manage independent legal counsel. It also clarified that the state attorney general’s involvement in legal matters would be limited to instances where their services are specifically requested.
Deeds said another idea would be to amend the state code, which specifies that gubernatorial appointments cannot take effect until they are confirmed by the General Assembly, typically in January. Currently, once the governor agrees, a gubernatorial appointment can be allowed to serve immediately on boards including on governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions.

Recently, the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was permitted to take up the appointments because lawmakers have not recessed from the 2024 Special Session.
Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, said one of the areas lawmakers need to work on is ensuring the confirmation process for gubernatorial appointments is transparent and people understand how it works. She said even some of the new and seasoned legislators are uncertain of the process. 
“I think there absolutely can be ways to clarify so that we don’t have to take legal action in the future if someone does not step out of the role,” Callsen said.
Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, said she plans to introduce a legislative proposal that would require all public colleges and universities to elect nonvoting faculty and staff representatives to their boards. Most institutions allow nonvoting faculty representatives; the proposed bill would make it a requirement.
Lawmakers and supporters have advocated for similar efforts to give faculty and staff a voice in decision-making, aiming to improve policies on retention, recruitment, and overall workplace confidence.
The proposal has died in back-to-back sessions. Youngkin vetoed the bill in 2024, citing cost concerns and a lack of oversight. Deeds’ similarly unsuccessful proposal in 2023 focused solely on the University of Virginia’s governing board.
“I think it’s a great way to get more opinions and actual people that are interacting on the campus, to have their voices at the Board of Visitors,” Laufer said. “I think it’s crucial.”
Democratic lawmakers also haven’t ruled out the possibility of taking legal action against the federal government, as public concerns mount in the wake of Ryan’s resignation.
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, called for a stand against the Trump administration’s attempts to interfere in Virginia’s higher education landscape, which she said are exemplified by threats to take federal funds from universities and leaders who don’t align with the administration’s educational ideology.
“They do not want an informed citizenry. They want folks to learn what they want them to learn, and in doing so, they are again undermining civil rights, civil liberties and higher education, because the fear is — as it was in antebellum days (by) not teaching slaves how to read and write — that if you have an informed citizenry, then one will begin to question and raise questions.”

It was an outcome of congressional legislation that passed with bipartisan support, based on the recognition that medicine alone isn’t adequate for people living with a serious medical condition if their other needs aren’t met. The program is implemented in the commonwealth with its grant funding distributed to various organizations by the Virginia Department of Health.
If someone can’t afford food or housing, or doesn’t have transportation, he or she will have difficulty accessing necessary medical care. If someone with HIV has another medical issue that goes untreated, he or she will be more vulnerable to the virus. These are issues the Ryan White Program was designed to help patients navigate.
As of 2022, there were about 25,000 people living with HIV in Virginia. Community organizations funded through the Ryan White Program serve a significant number of these individuals. Part of the reason why the amount of people living with HIV in Virginia isn’t larger is due to the success of these organizations in testing, treatment, and support. 
Despite a long track record of success, the Ryan White funding allocated to community organizations is being severely undercut across Virginia, and it doesn’t seem to be entirely due to DOGE (or the “Department of Government Efficiency”) at the federal level. These cuts are a first test in how the Virginia state government may respond if Congress reduces access to the Affordable Care Act and eliminates Medicaid benefits for tens of thousands of low-income state residents. In a word: shamefully.
In the Hampton Roads region, Minority Aids Support Services recently lost $500,000 in funding to support individuals with HIV/AIDS. In Richmond, Nationz Foundation lost almost half of its funding, and the Capital Area Health Network lost all of its Ryan White program money to provide comprehensive care to individuals with HIV/AIDS, and was subsequently forced to close its wellness program.
Fredericksburg Area Health and Support Services (FAHASS) — which serves a region stretching from from the Blue Ridge to the Northern Neck — experienced an $850,000 funding cut. This translated to the loss of six professionals and broad cuts to important services that were previously provided to individuals with HIV. The discontinued programs include: rental and housing assistance, mental health services for the uninsured, financial support for non-HIV prescription medicine, dental health services and medical transportation.
Taken together as part of a holistic program, these were life-saving services that will be much less accessible for many low-income individuals with HIV. Stacy Wells, CEO of the LGBT Life Center in Norfolk put it this way: “The reality is after the 25 years we’ve been building these programs, they’ve now been dismantled in just months.” 
It’s uncertain why these cuts were made. Ryan White funding is allocated by the federal government to states, which then distributes the money to local care providers. While the federal government under the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce funding for health and human services in other areas, news stories across Virginia indicate that these recent cuts  were the outcome, at least at some level, of decisions made within state government.
I emailed a Virginia Department of Health spokesperson three weeks ago with a request for more information about the genesis and rationale for the funding cuts, and to learn more about the scope of Ryan White funding reductions across the commonwealth. Despite following up several times and receiving assurances that the information would be coming, I have not yet received it.
‘Care is resistance.’ Va. free health clinics strategize survival after state, federal funding cuts

For now, it is an open question about why the service providers that care for some of Virginia’s most vulnerable residents are being targeted for budget cuts, especially in a year when the state’s total revenue is more than $200 million dollars over earlier projections.
Maybe low-income people are an easy target? Members of Congress certainly seem to think so as they contemplate measures to reduce access to the Affordable Care Act and add new requirements and restrictions that will cut medical assistance to millions of Americans on Medicaid. 
How will our state respond if these cuts are enacted? Will state leaders fight to preserve healthcare access? Will they act with compassion to help those losing the treatments and services that they depend on? The current cuts to HIV/AIDS programs across the commonwealth, happening in a year with a budget surplus, do not bode well. 
These cuts have real-life impacts. People will lose access to medical care. Lives will become more difficult, and some lives will be lost prematurely. We are at risk of becoming a more harsh and uncaring society.
It doesn’t need to be this way. Virginia can stand up for its residents and ensure that everyone has access to the lifesaving medical care and support that they deserve. A good place to start would be by restoring funding to the community organizations across the commonwealth that serve individuals with HIV/AIDS.

Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions, including one from Pennsylvania, have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.

Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.
$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions includes the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence; California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault; DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence; End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence; Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Jane Doe Inc.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– – Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance)Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.
Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Ned Lamont last week vetoed House Bill 5002, which was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross his desk since he became governor in 2019. 
Lawmakers will now spend the coming weeks reworking the housing omnibus bill, with negotiations likely focused on changes to policies that mandate towns to plan for more housing, changes to parking requirements and potentially reviving a measure dropped during the session that would tie school construction money to affordable housing.
Lamont vetoed the bill, which his staff negotiated, amid objections from some groups largely centering around provisions on parking reform and a requirement for towns to plan and zone for a set number of units. Opponents feared the bill would dilute local control and put unrealistic expectations on towns for building more housing.
Now, lawmakers are pushing forward with more negotiations on the bill ahead of a special session that will likely be held either next month or in the fall. Democratic leadership said they’re focused on preserving as much of the bill as possible, and Senate Democrats have additional measures they want to add into the omnibus bill.
“I think we can make it better. I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities,” Lamont said last week.
[RELATED: What to know about H.B. 5002, the omnibus housing bill]
Democrats responded with disappointment and frustration about the decision, but said they were pushing forward with crafting the best possible bill.
“All the politics of the last couple of weeks I’m less concerned with and remain focused on the actual outcome, which is housing for people and families,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
“Housing remains a huge issue for so many people, and to do nothing lets many, many people down in our state,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk.
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he fears by vetoing the bill instead of signing it and asking for specific adjustments, Lamont may have opened the floodgates to more widespread changes to the bill.
“It seems like this veto is really geared towards one particular area in our state, and it was short-sighted,” Felipe said, referring to much of the opposition, which centered in Fairfield County. “It was a mistake, and I really hope that we have the wherewithal to stick together and put together another good bill, because the more time comes off the clock, the harder it is for us to start addressing the housing crisis.”
Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, said House Republicans haven’t been involved in negotiations on the new version of the housing bill, which he views as part of the problem. He has ideas, he said, but hasn’t had a meeting with Lamont to talk about them.
Lamont wasn’t clear last Monday, when he vetoed H.B. 5002, about what specific changes he wanted to see, although he said he wanted to push for policy that got town leadership more on board. Later in the week, details still weren’t available from his office.
“The Governor continues to meet with legislative and policy staff on developing aspects of a housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement Thursday. “He then hopes to meet with legislative leaders and engage with local officials on a draft proposal that helps to address the housing crisis while also ensuring towns and cities are partners in the process.”
Lawmakers said they have tried for years to get local leadership on board with housing policy change, particularly through a roundtable group on affordable housing convened in 2023. They questioned how realistic it is that the governor could come up with a meaningful policy that got people on board.
“It’s been very tough up until this point, but if he has a secret sauce, then more power to him,” Duff said.
Lamont said at a press conference to announce the veto that much of the opposition he heard, some of which he classified as misinformation, was around a policy known as fair share. The policy, which has been used in New Jersey for decades, would have required that towns plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing.
The numbers were based on a formula that divided up the regional housing need among towns. Felipe said there might be some adjustments to that approach to add more consideration for how much land is available to build housing in a municipality.
Rojas said there may also be adjustments to create a more robust process for towns to appeal their assigned numbers, although that process was already established in the bill Lamont vetoed.
“What is particularly troubling is that the governor’s decision seems to have been made in large part based on objections that were coming from misinformation-fueled objections,” said Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, which advocated for and helped craft the fair share portion. “We really can’t be a state that grounds its public policy on misinformation.”
Lamont also indicated he wanted to make changes to a policy that would ban formulaic parking requirements for smaller residential developments. The idea sparked opposition from local leadership who said it might result in not enough parking for residents, particularly those with mobility issues.
Casey Moran, a founder of CT Parking Reform, said these formulaic requirements are widespread. In Naugatuck, for example, studio apartments require at least three parking spaces. In Trumbull, accessory dwelling units require four parking spaces.
Adding parking makes building housing more expensive and takes up more land. Parking lots also create runoff that can hurt the environment.
Rojas said there may be changes to be made to the parking portion, although he didn’t get into detail.
Duff said that negotiations on the bill “can’t just be one-sided,” and that Senate Democrats want to add in a provision of the bill that would increase school construction reimbursement rates for towns that have at least 10% designated affordable housing. 
They’d removed that provision because they’d been told the governor would veto the bill if it was present, Duff said.
Lawmakers and advocates said it’s unlikely that there will be changes to a policy known as “Work, Live, Ride,” which prioritizes certain state infrastructure funding for towns that increase residential density near public transit.
Lamont last week also mentioned opposition to a measure that would have required towns to allow commercial properties to be turned into smaller housing complexes without a special hearing before planning and zoning boards.
Rojas said there may be changes to that policy.
Despite potential changes, he said he doesn’t think there’s a policy that will get everyone on board and significantly increase housing in Connecticut.
“Sometimes leaders using the authority and the power that they have, just need to lead, and that’s the way I feel about us at the state level and certainly at the executive branch level,” Rojas said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)Ohio lawmakers are trying once more to pass a controversial firearms measure building a wall between local officers and federal agencies.
To supporters, the bill is an expression of the anti-commandeering doctrine found in the Tenth Amendment. Opponents argue it’s a new attempt at nullification and its restrictions on federal cooperation will kneecap cops and prosecutors.
What’s in the bill
At the heart of Ohio House Bill 382, known as the Second Amendment Preservation Act, is a prohibition on state and local law enforcement agencies working with federal counterparts to enforce federal laws or regulations.
The bill allows ordinary citizens to sue Ohio agencies over alleged violations and imposes a $50,000 civil penalty per occurrence.

The driving idea behind the proposal is that states have the right and obligation to uphold firearms rights against any threat — notably, “foreign or domestic.”
Backers believe agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have instituted regulations that violate Second Amendment rights, and that those restrictions are unconstitutional given the Tenth Amendment’s constraints on federal authority.
“This bill is a serious and necessary response to very real threats,” Ohio Gun Owners Executive Director Chris Dorr argued in a press release. He bragged that already 35 lawmakers have signed on to the proposal, “standing shoulder-to-shoulder with gun owners and making it clear: Ohio will not be a tool for federal tyranny.”
Although Dorr and other supporters reach for lofty arguments, the proposal’s inciting incident was relatively banal. The ATF under former President Joe Biden moved to restrict pistol braces.
Historically, it’s an accessory helping people with disabilities steady their aim, but in more recent years the braces have morphed into an attachment that allows a shooter to brace a weapon against their shoulder like a rifle.
Backers voice support for bill keeping Ohio cops from enforcing federal gun laws

The ATF’s final rule left out the former but required gun owners with the latter to register the weapon, alter it (removing the brace or elongating the barrel), or destroy the weapon.
The latest bill includes a provision meant to hamper enforcement of pistol brace regulations in Ohio, but Courts have since put the rule on hold. The current Trump administration also seems unlikely to defend it, but Dorr insists that’s no reason not to act.
“Pro-gun momentum like we are seeing under President Trump doesn’t last forever,” Dorr argued. “We have the votes. We have the people. We have the support. Now is the time to act — not next year, not after the next election — now.”
Where things get murky
The latest iteration of the proposal also brings back a section of legislative findings — essentially a statement of purpose written into statute. Among its assertions, federal powers not explicitly granted in the Constitution “are unauthoritative and of no force;” the supremacy clause does not extend to firearm restrictions “within the borders of Ohio;” and federal authority over commerce and taxes “merely identify” the government’s “limited powers,” rather than allowing it to “diminish” the right to bear arms.
Because the separation of powers doctrine generally places that kind of legal interpretation under the court’s purview, that section was quickly removed the last time lawmakers debated the bill.
Still, the new proposal attempts to distance itself from some of the more controversial provisions in the previous version. For instance, a prohibition on state and local agencies hiring people who previously worked for the federal government does not appear in the latest draft.
And for all the bill’s bright line assertions about where federal authorities ends, several carveouts underscore that it’s just not that simple.
State and local agencies rely on federal support on a daily basis — the national ballistics database, which helps draw links between firearms used in multiple crimes, offers just one example. Interagency task forces are crucial in drug and human trafficking investigations.
“This bill is a stinker.” Opponents bash Ohio Second Amendment ‘sanctuary’ legislation

Both examples were leveled by opponents last time the bill was offered, and sponsors amended the bill to allow them. However, critics argue those tweaks can’t redeem a flawed proposal.
Lou Tobin heads up the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association. In an email he said he appreciates the sponsor “trying to address” problems that came up before. In practice, though, he doesn’t think the changes will make a difference.
Pointing to the ballistics database, Tobin said, “it only allows that ‘to enforce the laws of the state or a political subdivision’ when entering information into a national database necessarily assists federal law enforcement, too.”
“Allowing us to refer violent felonies to federal prosecutors when there are ‘ancillary’ weapons violations sounds like a compromise,” Tobin added, “but what ‘ancillary’ means in this context remains unclear. The bill says explicitly that it ‘shall be construed strictly against the state.’ So the bill is still going to have a chilling effect on law enforcement efforts to address violent crime in this state because people aren’t going to want to be sued.”
Erick Bellomy’s father was shot and killed in a botched robbery in 2017.
He now heads up the Ohio chapter of Brady United Against Gun Violence and said he’s “appalled” at lawmakers continuing to advance legislation like the Second Amendment Preservation Act.
“Law enforcement officers and police chiefs across the state have warned this bill makes it harder—not easier—to keep our communities safe,” he added. “When law enforcement and public safety leaders oppose a bill, we should listen.”
Bellomy criticized the legislation’s carveouts as “confusing and contradictory,” warning they “threaten to paralyze law enforcement.”
Like Tobin, he criticized provisions limiting cooperation with federal prosecutors unless gun charges are only “ancillary” to the case. The restriction is “so vague that it may prevent prosecutors from pursuing justice in violent cases involving guns,” Bellomy argued.
If lawmakers want to protect Ohioans, Bellomy said, they should focus on safe storage, extreme risk protection orders and community violence intervention efforts.
“These are real, evidence-based strategies that reduce gun deaths—without infringing on anyone’s Second Amendment rights,” he argued.
“Let me be clear: no one wants to take guns away from law-abiding citizens,” Bellomy added. “What we want is to ensure that guns are stored safely, used responsibly, and kept out of the hands of those with malicious intent or a history of violence.”

So can consumers in surrounding states, it said.
Tariffs — which are taxes on imports — affect various sectors of the economy differently. Retailers who participated in the survey were the group that said it was most likely to pass on increased costs from Trump’s tariffs. 
A full 90% said they expected to raise prices in the next six months. Seventy two percent of manufacturers and 71% of construction businesses said the same. Minorities of professional-services firms (43%), financial-services firms (38%), and freight carriers (20%) said the tariffs would increase their costs enough to force them to raise prices.
After taking office, Trump announced tariffs on almost all of the country’s trading partners. Then in early April, he said he would delay most for 90 days to give time to negotiate what he saw as more equitable deals. Very few deals have been completed with the 90-day deadline set to expire next week.
Trump said that even without deals in place, he’s not interested in extending the deadline beyond July 9.

“We’ll look at how a country treats us — are they good, are they not so good — some countries we don’t care, we’ll just send a high (tariff) number out,” the Associated Press quoted Trump as saying on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” 
For businesses and customers in the region represented by the Cleveland Fed, tariffs are a serious matter, the report shows. The Cleveland Fed represents Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. 
Eight times a year, the agency conducts its Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations. The great majority of respondents to the May survey didn’t see Trump’s tariffs as helping their businesses.
Seventy percent said they’d have a negative impact on their businesses over the next six months and 20% said they’d have no impact. Just 9% of businesses said the Trump tariffs would be good for them over the short term.
How negative businesses were about Trump’s tariffs was related to how dependent they are on imports.
Retail, the sector that overwhelmingly said it would raise prices, said it got 27% of its inputs from overseas. That was followed by manufacturing, at 18%, construction, at 14%, freight, at 8%, businesses and professional services, at 6%, and financial services, at 2%.
Even though businesses in the financial services sector aren’t worried that the Trump tariffs will push their input costs up, they have another worry: that people will have less money for them to manage. Ninety percent of firms that responded said the tariffs would decrease demand for their services over the coming six months. 
More than half of businesses in every sector said they expected demand for their goods and services to decrease. And, compared to the February survey, the businesses seem more pessimistic generally.
“More firms were expecting to decrease employment, capital spending, and inventory levels than increase them because of higher tariffs. The share of firms expecting to decrease employment rose to 32 percent compared to 22 percent in our February survey,” the report said.

(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom.)The proposals to overturn legislation overhauling higher education, eliminate property taxes, and end qualified immunity will not be on the November ballot, despite advocates trying to get the question to Ohio voters.
Public education advocates have fallen short 50,000 signatures of the needed 250,000 to put a referendum on the Ohio ballot, Youngstown State University Professor Dr. Cryshanna Jackson Leftwich said. She was aiming to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 1, a controversial college overhaul bill.
The effort was led by a small grassroots organization made up of mainly Youngstown State professors like Jackson Leftwich. The group had no money, no backing from statewide or national education groups or paid canvassers — which she said was a problem.
Typically, successful coalitions submit hundreds of thousands more signatures, because oftentimes they are invalid.
When Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the group putting an amendment on the ballot to protect abortion, IVF and contraception, they submitted 300,000 more signatures than needed as cushion room. The group needed around 415,000, submitted 710,000 and ended with about 500,000 valid.
“It shouldn’t take millions of dollars to fight [for] democracy,” she said. “It shouldn’t take millions of dollars for consultants and lawyers for average voting citizens to say, ‘Hey, this is an unjust bill.'”
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, the top Republican on the influential Finance Committee, introduced the legislation.
“It provides for a policy to be established for what I call intellectual diversity, which is very important,” Cirino said. “It means openness to all various thoughts about various issues, which is the opposite of indoctrination — indoctrination is when you expose students to only one train of thought, so a monolithic thought environment. That is not good for students.”
This massive bill focuses on what the Republican calls “free speech,” banning public universities in Ohio from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, or having “bias” in the classroom, and limiting how “controversial topics” can and can’t be taught. Eliminating DEI would mean no diversity offices, training, or scholarships.
“I believe that will benefit students greatly and produce better students who know how to think and analyze and come to their own conclusions,” he added.
Students and professors from across the state have continued to argue that there is nothing wrong with their education, and they are furious that lawmakers are trying to interrupt their classes.
This is one of the most protested-against bills in recent Ohio history. There were roughly 1,500 people who submitted opponent testimony against S.B. 1, and there were about 30 who submitted in support. Which is why Amanda Fehlbaum, a YSU professor, was shocked when no larger organizations “stepped up” to help them, she said.
The group raised $45,000 in six weeks and collected the signatures without any paid assistance, which was very challenging, Fehlbaum added, emphasizing that larger groups said that a referendum would be “too expensive,” she said.
Cirino said Thursday that he isn’t surprised that the effort failed, because he said the bill is good policy.
“I think their biggest problem was that this was a group of disgruntled faculty members, mostly from Youngstown State, who are satisfied with the status quo in higher education,” he said. “They couldn’t be more detached from reality in terms of what needs to be done to make Ohio’s Higher Ed the very best we can be.”
But the S.B. 1 repeal wasn’t the only “everyday” group that couldn’t get on the ballot.
The Citizens for Property Tax Reform didn’t submit the signatures they gathered.
“It’s such a huge undertaking,” organizer Beth Blackmarr said Thursday.
Blackmarr helped create a coalition of homeowners in Cuyahoga County, hoping to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would eliminate property taxes.
Her team, Citizens for Property Tax Reform, knew they weren’t near the 415,000 they needed. She didn’t have an estimate of how many they collected, nor how much money they raised.
“As naive as we are, we may have underestimated, just a little bit, how big the response was really going to be,” she said. “That’s been quite rewarding, so we’ve asked everybody to keep on trucking and keep going.”
Despite both being grassroots, her situation is different from Jackson Leftwich’s for two main reasons: constitutional amendment proposals can be pushed back to future elections, and she told us a month ago that her proposal didn’t even have to reach the ballot.
“Hopefully, what legislators will do is counter with some legislation of their own,” she told me in May.
And it has worked.
“I’m hoping this does help to push us,” State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said when asked about the tax amendment.
Thomas leads property tax relief discussions in the House and said that he and the other members heard Blackmarr. Since her amendment, lawmakers have been proposing more property tax relief bills and have passed several in the budget.
“This is a win-win for Ohio,” Blackmarr said.
Strategy has to come into play when getting an issue proposed statewide, she added.
“Ohio makes it as difficult as possible,” YSU’s Education Association President Mark Vopat said, detailing all of the work that must be done to go through the extensive collection process. “I believe that the state has made it as onerous as possible for individual citizens like us, — we’re doing this as a voluntary effort — to actually get some sort of referendum passed.”
For all ballot proposals, campaigns need valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
For referendums, the total signatures must be 6% of the total votes cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 248,092 valid signatures.
For initiated statutes, the total signatures must be 3% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 124,046 valid signatures.
For constitutional amendments, the total signatures must be 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 413,487 valid signatures.
There have been efforts to make this harder, though.
Republican leaders in Columbus are floating the idea of attempting to make it more difficult to amend the state constitution, a proposal that was defeated in 2023 by Ohioans across the political spectrum.
Issue 1 in 2023 would have taken away majority rule in Ohio. The proposed constitutional amendment would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass from 50%+1, a simple majority, to 60%. It was defeated 57-43%.
The following year, 2024, the Senate GOP moved to increase the amount of counties campaigns must collect from and put more bureaucratic layers on advocates. They wanted to require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a political action committee (PAC).
This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.
Other challenges campaigns can face deal with the political offices they must go through.
Ohio activists are starting to gather signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would end qualified immunity — a protection for police and other government officials that prevents citizens from suing them.
State law prevents government officials from being held liable for civil damages unless the victim can prove that the officer violated their constitutional rights, which can be an uphill battle, advocates say.
The Ohio Coalition to End Qualified Immunity has been battling Attorney General Dave Yost to get their summary language approved so that they can collect signatures. He has rejected it eight times, and recently, in short, courts have required him to allow them to move forward.
From their approval, they would have only had two months at most to collect signatures. Although initially hopeful for November, their team told us Thursday that they are now aiming for 2026.
But when it comes to S.B. 1, Jackson Leftwich said this isn’t the end for them, either.
“If we got this on the ballot, we would have overturned it,” she said.
The group didn’t specify if and how they would try again, or just rely on the larger groups in future years.

Medicaid recipients fear potentially devastating cuts,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-medicaid-recipients-fear-potentially-devastating-cuts/,"“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life. I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”","Lauren Stuparitz and her son (photo courtesy of Stuparitz)It wasn’t until she was 20 years old and pregnant with her son that Brittany Groover first applied for Medicaid. Growing up in a working class, western Pennsylvania household before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, Groover’s father was insured through work, but she and her mom weren’t.
“My parents were the people that made just a little too much money to qualify for assistance,” she said. “I don’t recall going to the doctors for checkups. We would only go to urgent care if I had an ear infection or something.”
Once she was covered, the safety net allowed her peace of mind during her pregnancy. And six years later, in 2021, it allowed her to get treatment when she was diagnosed with stage 3a melanoma that spread to her lymph nodes. 
“I looked this up recently, because this has been a big, hot topic,” she said. “One immunotherapy treatment was $42,000. I had to do 18 of them.”

After 18 sessions of immunotherapy and three surgeries, Groover is in remission. And the experience led her to take up advocacy. Last year, she began working with the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network, where she encourages healthy habits and tries to educate people on the importance of Medicaid.
But now, Groover, 31, is worried about what could come next.
She is one of more than three million Pennsylvanians — over one in five people — who are insured through Medicaid. According to the Cancer Action Network she is also among the one in 10 Americans with a history of cancer who are insured through the program, including one in three children newly diagnosed. So, she is paying close attention to whether Congress moves forward with steep cuts to the programs being pushed by the Trump administration.
“I’ve been thinking about this non-stop,” Groover said. “If I lose my Medicaid, and my appointment comes up for a PET scan, I would genuinely be thinking, ‘If I go to that and put myself in debt, then how am I going to pay for food, or put a roof over my head or take care of my son?’ That’s what every single person on Medicaid is dealing with.”
The proposed cuts are part of a sweeping budget bill that will enact many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities. The proposal, which only needs a simple majority vote, has already passed the U.S. House along partisan lines.
As it stands, senate Republicans spent Monday voting on a series of amendments in an attempt to unite divided factions of their party, with some concerned about the bill’s overall price tag, and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance. If passed, the bill will be returned to the House for a final vote or additional changes
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the bill could result in nearly 12 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2034. 
At the state level, the commonwealth’s Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Another 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases, Val Arkoosh, the department’s head, has said.
Pennsylvania’s 10 Republican congressmen unanimously voted in support of the House version of the bill that passed last month. In a recent town hall, Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s only Republican in the Senate, also signaled support for reining in Medicaid spending. 
McCormick said the aim was not to reduce Medicaid spending from current levels, but to curb the program’s growth and refocus it on helping children, the elderly, the mentally ill and the disabled.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said. “We want to ensure that Medicaid protects the vulnerable people for whom it was designed”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As the bill stands, this is primarily accomplished through new work requirements that would mandate most Medicaid recipients prove they work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. McCormick said the goal is to ensure that healthy, able-bodied adults are not using the service. Critics say it’s a disguised effort to decrease spending by throwing up bureaucratic red tape for people who would otherwise be covered.
The next largest source of cuts would stem from a provision forcing states to lower taxes on health care providers like hospitals and nursing homes that help raise additional funding for Medicaid. The bill would require states to incrementally lower those provider taxes from a maximum of 6% down to 3.5% by 2032. 
Critics of provider taxes say they’re an accounting trick that allows the state to get additional Medicaid match funds from the federal government, with the revenue often returning to the health care providers that paid them in the first place. But defenders say they’ve become a critical source of funding.
The state Department of Human Services said the change could result in $2.7 billion in lost funds when they take full effect in 2032. That includes both the state revenue from the taxes as well as the federal Medicaid matching funds.
‘I felt so helpless’
Patrick Keenan, the director of policy at the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, an advocacy group, says a large majority of people on Medicaid who can work already do.
“Our analysis shows that 4% of folks on Medicaid aren’t working or qualified for an exemption to work requirements,” Keenan said. It’s a number that’s roughly in line with the national unemployment rate.
Moreover, Keenan said that, in practice, work requirements primarily result in a lot of people who should qualify for Medicaid not receiving it. 
“A lot of folks that are working and eligible get cut from the program, because it’s very difficult to get all the documentation, on one hand,” he said. “On another hand, it’s very difficult for all that documentation to be processed correctly, and there’s no additional funding for that — or very little — from Congress.”

Keenan pointed to Arkansas and Georgia, the only two states that have implemented Medicaid work requirements. In Arkansas, the requirement led to thousands losing insurance who previously qualified for Medicaid expansion, an Affordable Care Act program that allowed states to offer Medicaid to low-income adults. Arkansas’ work requirement program ultimately ended in 2019, after a judge declared it “arbitrary and capricious.”  In Georgia, the rollout of a program to offer expanded Medicaid coverage to a small group who could prove they met work requirements resulted in far fewer than expected actually enrolled. While the state estimated 246,000 people would be eligible, only 6,500 ended up actually enrolled, and it ultimately cost more per person to enroll them than it would have in other states that offered blanked Medicaid expansions.
For context, the U.S. House bill’s work requirements would apply to an even larger share of the Medicaid population than Georgia’s.
The CBO estimated that the proposed work requirements alone will result in five million fewer Americans receiving Medicaid by 2034. The report added only a few would likely be able to get insurance through an employer afterward.
The bill would also make it harder for anyone who can’t meet work requirements to get a plan through the federally funded health care marketplace. That’s because they would become ineligible for premium tax credits. Those tax credits are a mechanism in the Affordable Care Act that keeps marketplace prices down for low- and middle-income families. They can be paid directly to an insurance provider to lower monthly costs, and often lower premiums by hundreds of dollars.
But, the burden of ensuring Medicaid recipients all qualify for the program will ultimately fall on the state officials who oversee it. The bill would require Medicaid administrators to ensure enrollees are meeting work requirements at least every six months.
Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services, said the new reporting requirements could “create an unprecedented and unfunded increase in the administrative burden on DHS that will strain existing operations and divert resources from mission-critical service delivery across the Medicaid and SNAP Programs.”
Even without that added strain, administrative errors can already lead to people losing health care.
In 2010, Lauren Stuparitz, a Pittsburgh native, was assaulted and suffered a head injury. For years, she struggled to read and concentrate, and was regularly in pain.
After three years, she gave up her teaching job and qualified for Medicaid, which she said helped her receive treatment that otherwise would have been unattainable. While she still suffers side effects, it was an enormous help.
“It’s been lifesaving,” Stuparitz, 40, said of Medicaid. “I feel like people use that word a lot, but I’m not actually sure what else to use because I don’t know if I’d have much of a quality of life without it.”
When her first son was born in 2020, he also received insurance through Medicaid. The safety net has been essential, especially since he was diagnosed with autism.
But, last year, Stuparitz hit a roadblock when she tried to recertify her Medicaid eligibility. 
At the time, she was doing temp work for the U.S. Census Bureau and making more money than usual. She says the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services incorrectly used that temporary pay to determine her annual income. 
As a result, she was told she no longer qualified and that her son was being switched to CHIP, a program for children in households that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.

“I felt so helpless, honestly,” she said. “If I have to lose my insurance, that’s fine, but I need my son to be able to get what he needs.”
Her son had come to rely on regular appointments with early development specialists, who she learned didn’t accept his new insurance.
“For kids who are on the spectrum, having the routine is a critical thing,” Stuparitz said. “When things are in flux, it throws them off. It was probably one of the most stressful things I’ve ever had to deal with in my life.”
So for weeks, Stuparitz built up medical debt while she tried to get the situation rectified. She struggled to get through to a person in the Medicaid office who could help, and when she did, she said she was usually told to resubmit documents online.
Eventually, Stuparitz said she was able to prove she qualified for Medicaid, and was also able to bill the insurance for her son’s unpaid appointments.
While Stuparitz doesn’t blame the Department of Human Services or hold a grudge, she worries that what happened to her may become far more common if the amount of bureaucracy for people on Medicaid is increased.
“It’s just something that happens when you have a large system,” Stuparitz said. “But if your income’s not very cut and dry, I think it’s easier to happen. I feel like it has to be common, especially if you’re dealing with people who have a health condition that prevents them from working steady hours.”
A spokesperson for the department did not comment on the specifics of Stuparitz’s case when asked, but said “DHS works diligently to ensure the benefits DHS administers get to the eligible Pennsylvanians who need and qualify for them.”
“If it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
Jennifer Rabe-Coulibaly, 42, has lived her life between Middletown, in Dauphin County, and west Africa. Her parents were missionaries, and she followed in their footsteps. That means traveling back and forth every few months or years. 
Rabe-Coulibaly asked that the specific country not be named because of threats emanating from conflict there.
In 2021, Rabe-Coulibaly married a west African man, Emmanuel Coulibaly. In 2023, after he got a green card, they flew to Pennsylvania, where they’ve been living since. 
Overseas, both can be insured through the mission, but when they came to the U.S., they were unable to afford the premiums themselves. They both applied for Pennie, Pennsylvania’s marketplace option that provides more affordable insurance for low- and middle-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid.
Almost immediately, they put their plans to use.

For Coulibaly, it meant receiving care for an issue he dealt with almost his entire life. As a child in west Africa, he was injured and his two legs developed to be different sizes. In America, with insurance, he was finally able to get treatment.
Coulibaly’s leg required major surgery and a hip replacement. When he failed to recover properly, he needed another operation.
“Without Pennie, my husband wouldn’t have been able to go through these operations,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “One of the doctors said if he didn’t, in 10, 20 years, he’d be in a wheelchair.”
Meanwhile, Rabe-Coulibaly had become pregnant, which qualified her for Medicaid.
At 40, this meant more frequent doctor’s visits. At the same time, she was helping her husband recover, and had to go to his doctor’s appointments to translate. He speaks French and is still learning English.
“My (obstetrician), she’s like, ‘You need to take it easy,’” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “I said, ‘I wish, but I can’t.’ It was a lot.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At eight months, Rabe-Coulibaly developed preeclampsia, and her baby was delivered with a cesarean-section. While both she and her baby are now healthy, things seemed so bad initially, Coulibaly later told her he thought she or the baby was going to die.
“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life,” Coulibaly said. “I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
The experience has informed her perspective on Medicaid, Pennie and the potential impacts of Congress’ budget bill.
To start with, Rabe-Coulibaly isn’t sure that she’d be able to prove she meets work requirements, given the nature of her job. While in Pennsylvania, Coulibaly works for the mission, answering phone calls and emails, and making presentations at churches.She logs hours and files her taxes as self-employed, but is paid different amounts monthly, depending entirely on donations.
“It would depend on what Medicaid wants as far as documentation,” she said. “What I’ve been doing is just writing down on a piece of notebook paper what I’m doing.”
It’s also opened her eyes to how tenuous health care can be. 
In a previous version of the bill, many legal migrants, like Coulibaly, would have been barred from receiving premium tax credits that help pay for Affordable Care Act plans like Pennie, until they’ve been in the country for five years.
Without the additional funds, Rabe-Coulibaly said, her husband would not have been able to afford insurance.
That part, however, was struck down by the Senate parliamentarian on the grounds that such a move would require 60 votes, and not the 51 allowed by the reconciliation process.
A number of Republicans, as well as Trump, called for the parliamentarian to be overruled, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and others said they had no intention to do so.
Still, the attempt has been on Rabe-Coulibaly’s mind.
Rabe-Coulibaly understands why people think non-citizens shouldn’t have access to social services generally, but she worries about what the future may hold for legal immigrants like her husband.
“The U.S. has a reputation of welcoming people from other cultures,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “Part of that welcoming is to help them out in times of need. I’m not talking about taking advantage of the system, because I know there’s that out there, but I’m talking about in times of need, letting people like my husband benefit from some of these programs.”
It’s been another concern that’s kept her watching, like Brittany Groover and Lauren Stuparitz, as Congress debates the fate of health care programs that all three described as life saving.
“I was never a political person before all this,” Groover said about how she was affected by threats to Medicaid. “I wasn’t even registered to vote until last year.”
It’s one reason Groover wants to share her story, which she does on a YouTube channel and with the Cancer Action Network.
“All these people, they keep saying people are fraudulently on medicaid.” she said. “That is not a real thing that’s happening. I’m the person you’re talking about. I’m not abusing the system. I’m using the system exactly how it was designed, because it’s a lifeline for me.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7930.HEIC-769x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

Thousands of Ohio jobs are at risk as Republicans in Congress decide the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, according to two new reports.


The 2022 federal climate law spurred announcements of more than $7 billion in clean energy projects in Ohio. An analysis by the nonpartisan business group E2 links those investments to nearly 5,000 announced jobs.


A separate research paper published this month by the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, used broader criteria to conclude that Republicans’ ​“One Big Beautiful Bill Act” puts more than 17,000 direct manufacturing jobs at risk in the state. The ripple effect on other sectors that work with clean energy companies could bring the number to more than 91,000.


Cleveland, Ohio-based solar company YellowLite is among the firms already pausing hiring in response to federal policy uncertainty. The company said it had planned to bring on 20 to 25 more workers this year to keep up with growing business. Those plans are now on hold.


If the threatened cuts happen, the company fears business will ​“decline dramatically,” said Al Frasz, YellowLite’s commercial business manager. ​“We will probably be in a mode of having to lay off 35% to 40% of our employees.”


Frasz is one of dozens of business, labor, civic, and other leaders in Ohio calling upon Congress to revise the current reconciliation budget bill to preserve the IRA tax credits and other clean energy provisions.


Ohio is among the top states to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. As of last summer, its 9th Congressional District had eight announced projects — more than any other district nationwide, according to E2, which advocates for policies that benefit the economy and the environment. Ohio also ranked among the top 10 states nationwide for announced projects.


“Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal, like the House’s, that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director, when the group released its data on May 29.




















Part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s success in spurring clean energy investments stems from its 10-year time frame for tax credits, noted Joe Flarida, executive director of Power a Clean Future Ohio, which works with local governments on clean energy. That signaled to businesses and communities that there would be some stability, which is important for business planning.


“What we saw was this massive movement and response to use and leverage those tax credits in a productive way,” Flarida said. Pulling the rug out from under organizations that planned or broke ground on projects expecting those tax credits ​“is going to be a wasteful-government-spending dilemma,” he continued. ​“What we’re going to see is a ton of investment that’s taken place over the past couple of years completely vanish overnight. And this is just bad policymaking.”


The Ohio Chamber of Commerce would like the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits to continue through 2035, said Tony Long, the organization’s general counsel and director of energy policy. The state needs more energy generation, he added, noting that Ohio imports about a quarter of its electricity from other states.


“These credits will help continue to drive new development of energy sources,” Long said, noting that IRA tax credits have helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.


Private businesses won’t be the only ones impacted if Congress cuts or severely curtails the clean energy credits. ​“Direct-pay” provisions allow local governments and schools to access incentives after completing qualifying projects. Cities and counties in Ohio are already counting on more than $160 million in savings from those credits, 30 local government leaders told the state’s congressional delegation this spring.


Consumers also can expect higher electricity prices in the absence of clean energy credits, since less incentive to build new power plants means less energy in the marketplace. Full repeal of the tax credits could cost U.S. households an average of more than $110 per year, and businesses could expect a 10% increase in electricity costs, the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimated in February.


Debates continue on the federal reconciliation bill, which Republicans aim to pass in July. Impacts on businesses, workers, and communities will depend on the final provisions.


“This is in the politicians’ hands — if they’re going to continue these credits or they won’t,” said David Green, director of the United Auto Workers’ Region 2B office, which covers Indiana and Ohio. The labor union’s members have benefited from IRA-spurred growth in the automobile industry’s electric vehicle sector. ​“The reconciliation bill threatens to upend all the positive stuff we have worked towards building good manufacturing jobs, working with companies throughout Ohio and Indiana. … Good union jobs are on the line, and we need to do everything we can to protect the middle class of this country.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2208147809.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

(Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In coming weeks, our news feeds will be loaded with stories on the Trump administration’s plan to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the nation’s Medicaid program.
Already, we’ve heard stories about non-U.S. citizens being on the rolls, able-bodied adults not having to work, and — of course — widespread fraud and abuse.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
Before we go down this road, as Kansans, we need to get a few things straight.
Medicaid and Medicare are not the same thing. Medicare is designed to ensure health care for those of us over 65; Medicaid tries to do the same for the poor, our elders and people with disabilities.
Because Medicaid is underwritten by a mix of state and federal funds, states have a say in how their programs are administered. Since 2012, the Kansas Legislature has balked at taking advantage of federal incentives meant to close post-Obamacare gaps in Medicaid eligibility. Consequently, Kansas’ Medicaid program — known as KanCare — is one of the most restrictive in the nation.
Depending on your politics, you may think this is a good thing. But it doesn’t stop uninsured people from going to the emergency room. Hospitals just won’t be paid for treating them.
Other Kansas-specific facts to consider:

Childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid.
A parent caring for children is not eligible for Medicaid if their income exceeds 38% of the “federal poverty level,” which, for a parent with two kids, comes to about $843 a month.
The kids are most likely eligible, but the parents are not. Still, 70 percent of parents on Medicaid are working. Typically, the remaining 30 percent are either enrolled in a job training program or at home caring for a frail elder or child who should not be left alone.
Between 30 and 40% of all births are covered by Medicaid. About half of Medicaid recipients in Kansas are children.
In dire emergencies involving patients who aren’t U.S. citizens — complicated childbirths, for example — doctors and hospitals might be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. The billing process, however, is ill-defined, restrictive and often not worth the hassle.

In Kansas, Medicaid does not pay for non-emergent care for non-citizens. Other states’ programs are not as restrictive.
In its latest annual report, the Kansas Attorney General’s Office notes that from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, its Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Unit “obtained judgements” for more than $308,000. During the same period, Medicaid spending in Kansas came in around $5.5 billion. That’s not a lot. The unit’s 2024 report isn’t out yet.
Forty percent of Kansas nursing home residents’ stays are covered by Medicaid.
To be clear, Medicaid does not give money to poor people. Instead, it pays KanCare providers — three giant, for-profit managed care organizations — to provide care. These providers also are charged with helping frail elders and people with disabilities live in community-based settings because it’s a lot cheaper than paying for nursing homes to care for them.
Nevertheless, nursing homes are loaded with Medicaid patients and community-based options have long waiting lists.
Cutting Medicaid won’t help.
Analysts who have studied the contents of the “big, beautiful bill” working its way through Congress are telling advocates to be on the lookout for three scenarios.
First, Supporters will insist they don’t want to cut Medicaid; instead, they will say we need to increase accountability because there’s so much fraud and abuse. And for this to happen, current and would-be recipients will need to jump through additional documentation hoops. Those who stumble won’t be eligible. Fewer recipients will result in less spending.
Second, The bill calls for rescinding a Biden-era regulation that required nursing homes to hire more nurses and nurse aids. Shelving the requirement would trim billions of dollars in proposed Medicaid spending. The nursing home industry supports the change, arguing its profit margins wouldn’t cover the costs and even if they did, there aren’t enough nurses and aids available for hire.
Finally, Medicaid has long allowed states to collect a “surcharge” from hospitals with the understanding that the revenues would be used to draw down additional federal dollars. Hospitals welcomed the arrangement, knowing that for every dollar put in, they would get back roughly $1.50. The bill’s supporters, however, call this “money laundering.” Lawmakers hope to either freeze or significantly reduce the federal payments, ignoring repeated warnings that many rural hospitals would be forced to close or downsize.
A recent survey by the REACH Healthcare Foundation and the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund found that 26 rural hospitals in Kansas are already in “immediate risk of closure,” and another 63 are teetering.
A review commissioned by the Kansas Hospital Association found that “over half” of the state’s hospitals are “operating at a loss.”
None of this is good for Kansas, and no one knows this better than our own senators and representatives.

It was at the height of the eugenics movement and growing nativism in the U.S. after WWI. Congress had passed increasingly restrictive immigration laws that put a new emphasis on “desirables” and “undesirables” in deciding who was allowed to emigrate from where. 
The Senate sponsor of the 1924 Immigration Act, Republican David Reed of Pennsylvania, wrote that the law’s goal was to make the United States a more “homogenous” country.  
Mass immigration threatened to “dilute” that uniformity (sound familiar?) so national origins quotas were introduced to greatly curb or ban any group deemed not American enough or not expected to readily fuse with the native-born population. 
The xenophobic policies of the early 20th century — making a toxic resurgence in 2025 — slammed the door on Slavic immigrants who spoke strange languages and didn’t easily assimilate. 
The only reason a Slovak teenager with a basket trunk of belongings could find her way to Cleveland, Ohio was because she had been born in America. 
Years earlier, her parents had filed through Ellis Island with thousands of other immigrants bound for jobs in the industrial Midwest. They settled in Pa. but did not became U.S. citizens. Eventually the tug of familial ties in Sačurov drug the family back home to their rural village.  
Years later, my grandmother, prodded by her Slovak mother, would return to redeem her birthright citizenship.  
It was all she had to start a new life in Ohio but more than the rest of her foreign-born family, save a younger brother, to come to the U.S. The young woman who couldn’t speak a lick of English was an American citizen by birth — same as every other Ohioan who came into the world on American soil. 
The Constitution affirms that unconditional right even if Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost doesn’t.
Yost signed on to a brief supporting Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship. He was running for governor at the time and angling for a Trump endorsement that went to Vivek Ramaswamy. 
But Yost joined 16 GOP attorneys general to defend the indefensible; excluding babies born to undocumented immigrants and people with temporary status in the U.S. from the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause.  
In essence, the Republican AGs endorsed the power of one man to decide who, among those born in this country, is worthy of citizenship. It was grotesque sycophancy in service to a lawless megalomaniac high on his own supply of unchecked tyranny.  
Under the Trump criteria — abolishing 150 years of precedent and a longtime policy of unrestricted birthright citizenship — any baby born in the U.S. after his executive order would need to have at least one parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident to qualify as a citizen. 
That would exclude my grandmother today as a U.S.-born citizen to noncitizen parents and probably the grandparents of many other Ohioans born in America were they to be judged by the same standards Yost advocated in court. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
His brief argued that, despite plain text to the contrary, the Constitution “did not confer citizenship to children born to individuals who were not lawfully and permanently present in the United States.” 
Moreover, Yost and the others asserted, states like Ohio are being harmed because babies who “likely would have been born in a different country” if it weren’t for birthright citizenship, may “participate in state welfare programs…and receive state healthcare…and obtain a driver’s license.” 
Because they are American citizens “born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” 
Whether a U.S.-born child’s parents are U.S citizens, stressed the ACLU, “does not impact whether that child is a citizen.” 
That principle, upheld in a Supreme Court case more than 100 years ago, confirmed that “a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who at the time were prohibited from becoming U.S. citizens — was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.” 
But the Supreme Court in 2025, stacked with Trump-appointed justices bent on giving him free reign to ignore the rule of law, just slapped down federal courts who had issued nationwide injunctions to stop Trump from implementing his clearly unconstitutional executive order.
The court’s right-wing majority basically made birthright citizenship a state by state, case by case, class-action or individual plaintiff patchwork of litigation destined to wind through lower courts for who-knows-how-long. 
In the meantime, Trump is free to roll out orders on which U.S.-born child will be denied the citizenship guaranteed to them by law in states that don’t object. 
Yost won’t object to natural-born Americans in Ohio being deprived of their rights under the 14th Amendment. The Trump bootlicker applauded those efforts and derided the judges who dared block them.  
“Democratically enacted laws (which executive orders are not) cannot be put on hold by judges who think they are kings,” said Yost with blind irony, considering the self-described king in the White House. “Americans’ freedom depends on each part of the government staying in its lane,” he puffed. 
But apparently not on fealty to the Constitution from Ohio’s chief law enforcement officer.

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Georgia kids can continue liking, commenting and subscribing without notifying their parents this summer after a federal judge put a temporary hold on the state’s new social media age verification law while the case moves forward – but the bill’s author says a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling bodes well for the ban.
Senate Bill 351, which was set to go into effect July 1, would require social media companies to get a parent’s permission before they allowed a minor to create an account. All Georgians would also have to verify their age before accessing websites with material deemed harmful to minors.
On Thursday, Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of NetChoice, a coalition of social media companies, who argued that the law as written would likely violate free speech protections.
“The Court does not doubt the dangers posed by young people’s overwhelming exposure to social media,” Totenberg wrote. “But, in its effort to aid parents, the Act’s solution creates serious obstacles for all Georgians, including teenagers, to engage in protected speech activities and would highly likely be unconstitutional.”
Totenberg said the law would curb the speech rights of young people, impose a burden on all Georgians to participate in online speech, potentially put Georgians’ private data at risk and step into parents’ decisions on how to raise their children.
But Totenberg said the law’s biggest downfall comes in its long list of exemptions, which include news, sports, and entertainment sites, interactive gaming platforms, streaming services and more.
“For example, SB 351 would presumably apply to the Georgia Bulldogs Reddit forum, which features user-generated content. But it would exempt Barstool Sports, which features provider-generated content. It would apply to news coverage posted by users on X, but not news coverage posted by The New York Times to its own liveblog.”
Totenberg found that amounts to a content-based restriction on speech, which triggers a higher level of scrutiny – which she said Georgia’s law doesn’t meet.
“Because of the enormous burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of children, adults, and social media platforms — along with the significant tailoring issues inherent in the law — even the State’s serious interest here cannot justify SB 351 under the First Amendment’s rigorous standards,” she said.
NetChoice celebrated the win in a statement.
“This is a major victory for free speech, constitutional clarity and the rights of all Georgians to engage in public discourse without intrusive government overreach,” said Chris Marchese, NetChoice director of litigation. “We are grateful the court recognized what we’ve long argued: SB 351 isn’t just poorly crafted — it’s profoundly unconstitutional.”
But the bill’s author, state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader, said their victory is likely to be short-lived.
In a statement, Anavitarte pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed a Texas state law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.
“One day after liberal Obama Appointee, US District Court Judge, Amy Totenberg, issued an injunction preventing Georgia’s age verification law from taking effect, The Supreme Court found that laws like SB 351 ‘have only an incidental effect on protected speech and that The First Amendment leaves undisturbed States’ traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective….Requiring proof of age is an ordinary and appropriate means of enforcing an age-based limit on obscenity to minors,’” Anavitarte said.
“Based on Friday’s ruling at The Supreme Court, Judge Totenberg should be left with no choice but to allow SB 351 to go into effect,” he added. “I am immensely grateful for Justice Clarence Thomas’ well written opinion and remain optimistic that SB 351 will go into effect in its entirety.”
Attorney General Chris Carr’s said Carr intends to appeal the ruling.
“We will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,” said Carr spokesperson Kara Murray.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 00:58:30.823918

It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.","The bombs have stopped—for now. After two weeks of missiles, threats, and the terrifying drumbeat of war, a ceasefire has arrived. Tel Aviv exhales. Washington strategizes. Tehran recalculates. 
But in Iran, the silence feels different. It isn’t peace. It’s a pause. And in that pause, another battle rages —quieter, older, far more consequential. Because Iran’s most dangerous war isn’t with Israel or the United States. It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.
Every time Tehran fires missiles abroad, it’s also tightening the noose at home. While international cameras track explosions over airbases, Iran’s gallows work overtime. Protesters disappear. Students vanish. Women are dragged into courtrooms for removing a scarf. This regime thrives on crisis. It builds legitimacy on chaos. But that strategy is fraying. The Iranian people are done being afraid.
The movement inside Iran today is not a flash in the pan. It is not a hashtag moment. It is a generation that has risen, again and again, from the bloodied pavements of 1988 massacre of 30,000 political prisoners, from labor strikes, from underground classrooms and shuttered newspapers.
This is a citizenry refusing to kneel. They are not asking the world to save them. They are demanding that we stop strengthening the boot that crushes them.
Why does Tehran escalate abroad? Because it is desperate at home. This isn’t strength. It’s survival mode. And the regime knows its greatest threat doesn’t come from warplanes or sanctions —it comes from Iranians who no longer buy the lie.
In Tehran’s prisons sit poets, teachers, students, workers. They have no missiles. But they are more dangerous to the regime than any foreign power —because they carry a vision — a vision of a secular, democratic Iran. One without executions. One where women are free, where religion is a choice, not a weapon, and where leadership is earned, not inherited through violence. 
That vision is not vague. It has a framework. It has a leader. It has a name: the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). Led by Maryam Rajavi, the NCRI offers more than protest —it offers policy. Her 10-point plan lays out a future secular democratic republic built on rule of law, gender equality, religious liberty, and peace.
It is not abstract. It is not exiled into irrelevance. It is organized, global, and growing. Inside Iran, it inspires courage. Abroad, it is gaining bipartisan support —from the U.S. House Resolution 166 to lawmakers in over 40 countries who know appeasement has failed.
This ceasefire will tempt many leaders to breathe easy, to return to familiar calculations: sanctions relief, backchannel deals, polite diplomacy with a government that kills children for chanting slogans. But history will not be kind to that strategy. If the world fails to act now, it risks turning this pause into a permission slip—for more executions, more repression, more lies.
So what can be done?  First, designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization across Europe. They are the regime’s mafia, both in Iran and abroad. Pretending they are a legitimate military force is a diplomatic fantasy.
Second, freeze the assets of regime elites and their families. There is no moral logic in letting torturers send their children to London prep schools while they hang teenagers in Mashhad.
Third, expose and dismantle the regime’s propaganda and influence networks in Western capitals. These aren’t think tanks—they are front groups that shield tyranny.
Finally, engage the alternative. The Iranian resistance has done the hard part: they’ve survived, organized, and laid out a democratic path forward. What they need now is recognition and solidarity —not weapons, not war. Just the truth, spoken clearly.
Regimes like Iran’s rely on one illusion: that they are eternal. But they are not.  They are loud, cruel, and brittle. And they fall —when the world stops looking away.
The Iranian people are already doing the hard work of history. The question is whether the rest of us will pretend this ceasefire is peace —or finally recognize that real peace only begins when dictatorships end.
Let us not mistake this moment for stability. Let us not waste the silence. Let us help turn this pause into a pivot—toward freedom, toward justice, toward an Iran reborn.

Antonio Felipe,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/connecticut-needs-to-be-more-affordable-lets-start-with-housing/,"The veto of HB5002 was a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to its hard-working families.","Connecticut did not meet the moment in 2025. Despite the outcry of our residents and the glaring reality of a housing and affordability crisis in our state, we didn’t do nearly enough to support our hard-working families.
This year, as co-chair of the state’s housing committee, I, along with many of mycolleagues, championed House Bill 5002. Ensuring access to quality housing is a foundational responsibility of the entire Connecticut legislature and yet I spent almost 12 hours debating House Republicans who were determined to sink the bill under false claims of eliminating local control.

Antonio Felipe
The bill passed both chambers after receiving strong public support from Gov. Ned Lamont. Then on June 23, the governor conceded and announced that he planned to veto the bill — even though he still stated support for most of the policies. In essence the governor capitulated to what he acknowledged was false information.
If that’s how decisions are made going forward our state is in deep trouble. A veto of this bill is a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to the hard working families and the most cost-burdened of us. I’d like to tell you why.
In 5002 we saw an opportunity for significant progress in housing, taking necessary steps while ensuring that local decisions were protected and local control was minimally impacted. One section of this bill simply requires that cities and towns submit affordable housing plans. The towns themselves create and submit these plans and zoning must only be changed if it is required to fit the plan that theysubmitted. 
Municipalities also have the opportunity to submit reasons why they cannot attain the goals set in their plan. We can use those reasons to help address the needs and barriers for local zoning.
This would allow towns to individually plan to meet these goals, maintaining local control over their plan on how to achieve more affordable housing. Another section called Work Live Ride is an optional program that incentivizes development near transportation hubs to ensure a vibrant workforce and that the current hardworking Connecticut residents can easily get where they need to go.
What are we doing about the actual building of affordable or multifamily housing in HB 5002?
There is over $100 million specifically prescribed for affordable housing projects, matching funds for our building trades to leverage their own capital to build housing, and a pilot program for housing authorities to buy properties and keep them affordable long term. 
There are fully optional partnerships with neighboring housing authorities for communities that struggle to build affordable housing., The bill would also grant the  ability to redevelop vacant commercial units, as of right, into much needed urban housing in downtowns and in areas closer to the services that many people living in our community need every day. Additionally we aimed to assist our most vulnerable residents with mobile showers and laundry for homeless persons, direct cash assistance for families eligible for Rental Assistance Program (R.A.P) Vouchers and make sure there are R.A.P vouchers available for families who have students in the Open Choice Program.
In 2025 we, the governor and the legislature, nibbled around the edges and were content with the status quo ruling the day under the guise of “fiscal responsibility.” I fully endorse smart fiscal policies aimed at improving our state’s financial position, lowering our debt, and protecting our taxpayers. What I don’t agree with is that we can’t pursue a more robust and forward thinking agenda that is fiscally responsible, while still acknowledging the moment that we are in and the residents who are struggling everyday with a rising cost of living.
We create these policies to build the resources necessary to invest in all people, especially our hard-working residents. What is the point of building a rainy day fund totaling $4.1 billion when a working family can’t find decent housing that fits their budget, or a young professional has no clear path towards owning a home?
House Bill 5002 was an opportunity to show hard-working families that we have their needs at heart and a veto by Governor Lamont ensured that once again we are missing the moment.
What was a large step in a progressive direction that hard-working families need us to move in became a false flag to anyone with hopes that Connecticut will begin to address the housing crisis we face. We are 46th in the United States in building permits per capita. We have the ninth highest cost of living. Our average rent inConnecticut is $2,071, the national average is $1,761 while our average apartment size is smaller than the national average.
We cannot continue to follow this administration’s current blueprint to build a rainy day fund by any means necessary while not acknowledging that for many families in our state the rain started years ago. 
We must address the many challenges that families and hard-working residents face as the cost of living soars. Connecticut is too expensive, too constrained and too segregated, but when faced with the opportunity to take a progressive step, we missed the moment.

Multiple firefighters shot, killed while responding to North Idaho brush fire; suspect found dead

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as Battalion Chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing.
Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.

Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened
The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday night had nearly completed hand lines around the fire, the department reported.
“The fire is burning through steep terrain in timber fuels,” the Department of Lands said in a press release. “Safety remains a top priority for the crews, with an abundance of snags on site, as well as the possibility of rolling logs and falling rocks.”
The department reminded the public that it’s dangerous to fly drones while emergency personnel are responding to a wildfire.
“A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place and remains in effect over the Canfield Mountain area,” the press release said. “Unauthorized drone and aircraft pose a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities. If you fly, we can’t. For firefighter safety we also ask the public to remain clear of the Canfield Mountain area.”

The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff
Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.

The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words — please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers
Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.

(Courtesy of OHA)OMAHA — The Omaha Housing Authority, Nebraska’s largest provider of government-subsidized housing, has filed a lawsuit challenging part of a new state law requiring it to cover the costs of a court-appointed attorney for tenants it seeks to evict.
The law, passed by the Nebraska Legislature and signed by Gov. Jim Pillen in 2024, takes effect Tuesday.
It targets OHA, which oversees more than 2,500 dwellings and 5,000 housing vouchers for low-income residents, but came with no additional funding, the agency’s leadership noted in a statement Monday about the lawsuit filed June 27 in Douglas County District Court.

OHA asserts that the new provision — which it estimates could cost nearly $1 million annually — is unconstitutional and preempted by federal law.
Joanie Balk, OHA chief executive, said her agency is funded through federal sources that explicitly bar the use of program funds to pay legal expenses on behalf of tenants. 
She said the unfunded mandate puts the OHA “at direct odds” with federal regulations and “threatens the integrity” of its programs, as the agency is required by federal law to take action against tenants who break its rules or are engaged in criminal activity. 
 ‘Last resort’

The lawsuit says OHA would effectively be unable to bring actions to evict tenants who fail to pay rent, commit crimes or otherwise violate terms of their lease agreement.
“Our organization is fully supportive of tenants having access to legal representation and in fact they already do through the Tenant Assistance Project (TAP),” said Balk. 
TAP is run by volunteer attorneys and law students who offer free services for people who appear for eviction hearings at Douglas and Lancaster County courthouses.

Balk said the lawsuit was “a last resort” made after repeated unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with state lawmakers and after attempts to identify resources to cover the required cost of attorney fees. 
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a frequent critic of OHA, said he wasn’t surprised by the lawsuit and said the agency was “run by horrible people.” He challenged the assertion that OHA leaders tried to resolve the issue, saying he hasn’t talked to an OHA manager since December.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha originally introduced the provision, amended into the broader Legislative Bill 840, requiring the housing authority to cover court-appointed counsel for Omahans it wants to evict. 
 Levels playing field 

Legal Aid of Nebraska applauded the new state law that guarantees legal representation for certain tenants facing eviction or lease termination. The law also covers tenants living in public housing units operated in Omaha by the Douglas County Housing Authority.

“With housing authorities regularly represented by attorneys, ensuring tenants have legal representation helps level the playing field,” Scott Mertz, director of Legal Aid’s Justice Project, said in a statement. “For many tenants, having a lawyer can mean the difference between staying housed or being evicted.
The OHA lawsuit included a statement from HUD that said the agency could not use public housing funds to pay for the court-appointed legal fees as called for in the new law. 
Earlier this year, the Legislature passed — but Pillen successfully vetoed — a McKinney-led attempt to seek potential remedies to a persistent bed bug infestation in OHA towers occupied by low-income residents.
In January, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Douglas County District Court seeking relief from the bed bugs. Former Omaha State Sen. Justin Wayne is on the legal team representing OHA plaintiffs in that lawsuit.

,California,2025-07-01 02:20:33+00:00,CalMatters,One of the biggest obstacles to building new CA housing has now vanished,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/06/ceqa-urban-development-infill-budget/,"In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.","In summary
In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.


A decade-spanning political battle between housing developers and defenders of California’s preeminent environmental law likely came to an end this afternoon with only a smattering of “no” votes. 
The forces of housing won. 
With the passage of a state budget-related housing bill, the California Environmental Quality Act will be a non-issue for a decisive swath of urban residential development in California. 
In practice, that means most new apartment buildings will no longer face the open threat of environmental litigation. 
It also means most urban developers will no longer have to study, predict and mitigate the ways that new housing might affect local traffic, air pollution, flora and fauna, noise levels, groundwater quality and objects of historic or archeological significance.
And it means that when housing advocates argue that the state isn’t doing enough to build more homes amid crippling rents and stratospheric prices, they won’t — with a few exceptions — have CEQA to blame anymore.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who introduced the CEQA law as a separate bill in March. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
Unlike most environmental laws, which explicitly mandate, monitor or ban certain environmental behavior, CEQA is just a public disclosure requirement. The 54-year-old statute requires state and local governments to study and publicize the likely environmental impact of any decisions they make. That includes the permitting of new housing. 
But for years, the building industry and “Yes in my backyard” activists have identified the law as a key culprit behind California’s housing shortage. That’s because the law allows any individual or group to sue if they argue that a required environmental study isn’t accurate, expansive or detailed enough. Such lawsuits — and even the mere threat of them —add a degree of delay, cost and uncertainty that make it impossible for the state to build its way to affordability, CEQA’s critics argue.
With today’s vote, the Legislature will be putting that argument to the test. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spent much of last week cajoling the Legislature to pass the bill as part of his budget package, is all but certain to sign it.
Now the question is whether this monumental political and policy shift will actually result in more homes getting built in California’s cities.
Many of the bill’s backers are optimistic.
“I think when we look back on what hopefully is California finally beginning to confront this housing crisis, this year — 2025 — and this bill will be viewed as a turning point,” said Matt Haney, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the Assembly where he chairs the housing committee.
On paper, the new law, unlike most that deal with housing approvals and environmental regulation, is actually pretty straightforward.
Urban “infill” housing developments — housing built in and around existing development — are no longer subject to CEQA.
There are some exceptions and qualifiers, but development boosters say they are relatively minor. 
The exemption is“the most significant change to the California Environmental Quality Act’s effect on housing production since CEQA was passed,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist for the Bay Area Council, a business coalition that regularly pushes for legislation that makes it easier to build.
The bill is limited to projects under 20 acres, but that cap is only relevant to the biggest multi-block-spanning mega developments.
A certain level of density is required, but it really only precludes using the policy for single-family home construction.
Before any project can move forward, any affiliated tribal government will have to be notified first, but the consultation is put on a short timeline.
In order to qualify for the exemption, a proposed project must also be consistent with local zoning, the regulations that determine what types of buildings can be constructed where. But thanks to another CEQA-chopping bill authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener that exempts many changes to zoning rules from CEQA and which is also packed into the budget, that appears less likely to be a real constraint. 
To buy off the ferocious opposition of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a construction union umbrella group, the bill also includes some higher wage requirements. 
But those rules are not likely to apply to most potential residential development projects. “The lion share of housing being built” in California will no longer be governed by CEQA, said Mark Rhoades, a planning and development consultant in Berkeley.
Take a massive five-story apartment building spanning a full city block, said Bill Fulton, a longtime urban planner and professor at UC San Diego. 
“You don’t have to worry about labor and you don’t have to worry about CEQA? That’s a big deal,” he said.
CEQA seachange
What a difference nine years make.
Consider how things went back in 2016 when then-Gov. Jerry Brown tried to ram a CEQA fix for California’s rising housing costs through the state budget process. Brown’s big idea was to “streamline” the housing approval process, allowing developers to make an end-run around the California Environmental Quality Act, so long as they set aside a certain share of units for lower-income residents.
A coalition of construction labor unions, environmental interests and local government groups torched the idea. The proposal didn’t even get a vote.
Nearly a decade later, once again a Democratic governor opted to stuff a CEQA-trimming policy package through the budget process in the name of cheaper housing. 
The measure passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and Assembly — and this time it didn’t even include an affordability requirement.

 Democrat, State Assembly, District 14 (Oakland)



Wicks’ proposal is somewhat narrower than the 2016 version, exempting only infill. New suburban-style subdivisions carved from farmland or undeveloped sagebrush will not qualify. 
That infill focus has made it easier for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to swallow such a significant scaling back of California’s signature environmental law. Promoting denser urban development generally means using less land, constructing new housing that uses less energy and setting up new residents to do a lot less driving. 
“When you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,” Wiener said on the Senate floor on Monday just prior to the vote, when the measure passed 28 to 5.
Even so, Wicks’ proposal always looked like a long shot. 
Since Brown’s failed gambit, lawmakers have managed to pass a raft of bills giving housing developers an escape route around CEQA. But those laws have always contained a trade-off. Developers get to skip CEQA, but in exchange they have to pay state-set “prevailing wages” (which typically work out to union-level pay), hire union workers outright, set aside a certain share of units for lower income residents, or some combination of the three. 
These conditions were born of political necessity. A CEQA lawsuit — or even the suggestion of one — makes for a powerful negotiating tool. Organized labor groups, mostly especially the building trades council, have not been keen to give up that leverage without getting something in return.
As housing developers proved less willing to use the new streamlining laws than those bills’ sponsors and supporters had hoped, many pro-building advocates, academics and commentators began calling for environmental streamlining with no strings attached.
Wicks answered that call earlier this year. Under her proposal, infill developers would be allowed to ignore CEQA, full stop. That marked a major break from recent legislative precedent, and one that seemed a stretch, even with so many Democratic lawmakers carting around copies of Abundance.
The deal that almost wasn’t
Just last week, Wicks’ proposal seemed on the verge of collapse.
A version of the bill introduced last week included what amounted to a minor wage hike for the lowest paid construction workers, who are virtually all non-union. While the state’s carpenters’ union supported it, the trades council emphatically did not — with one of the groups’ associated lobbyists likening it to Jim Crow. The trades objected so strenuously — arguing that it set dangerous precedent and undercut apprenticeship programs — that lawmakers removed the proposed wage change. 
Instead, developers working on projects that are entirely designated to be affordable would now be required to pay prevailing wages in order to take advantage of the new law. 
Developers of any projects over 85 feet tall would be required to hire a certain share of union workers. There are added restrictions for construction in San Francisco specifically.
By the standards of prior housing streamlining bills, those are relatively modest concessions. Most developments over 85 feet use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway.
Most entirely income-restricted housing projects make use of public subsidies that require paying union-level wages.
“Affordable housing is forced to play by different rules because the state has decided that if you are receiving public funds a certain wage should be attached to it,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing construction. The addition of a prevailing wage requirement for affordable housing “is a head scratcher,” he said. “But it really is reaffirming existing policy.”
That leaves every other type of housing project: Market rate and mixed-income apartment buildings under seven-or-so stories. For that type of construction, which defines the bulk of urban development in California, CEQA is soon to be entirely optional — no string attached.
That this is the new trades-endorsed deal has been met with a perplexed kind of glee from some corners of the “yes in my backyard” movement. The new version of the bill “is now *even better,*” UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf marveled on Twitter.
Will it matter?
What will urban housing construction look like in California without CEQA?
There are no shortage of reasons not to build housing in California. Labor costs, even without regulatory requirements, are high. So are interest rates. Tariffs and aggressive immigration enforcement are more recent sources of uncertainty. Developers are always happy to complain about slow permitting, high local fees and inflexible building codes. 
“It’s not the CEQA costs that are holding up housing,” said Rhoades, the Berkeley consultant. 
“I don’t think this is going to make more development happen,” he said of the budget bill. “It’s going to make development that is already happening a little easier.”
Critics of the law can and do point to specific projects — housing for students, housing near public transit, affordable housing built upon city-owned parking lots — that have been sued in the name of the environment as examples of “CEQA abuse.”
Under the new laws, such litigation will largely go away in California’s cities.
“The one thing we do know is that CEQA is a time suck,” said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation and the former head of the state’s housing agency under Brown. “If you can just get out of that six months, nine months, twelfth months of delay, that takes a whole cohort of projects and gets them in the ground sooner. In a state that’s facing a housing crisis, that’s not for nothing.”
But the more important consequence of CEQA, many of its critics regularly argue, has been its chilling effect. 
How many new units of housing would have been built, but for concerns that they might become ensnared in environmental litigation? How many developers, anticipating a possible legal challenge, have preemptively pared back their plans? How many financiers of housing projects pulled out or demanded higher interest rates over such concerns?

The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.","In summary
Major changes to the California Environmental Quality Act include an exemption for high-tech industrial plants and other projects. The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.



California lawmakers today approved one of the most substantial rollbacks of the state’s signature environmental review law in decades, including a controversial exemption that would allow high-tech manufacturing plants to be built in industrial zones with no environmental review.
The changes to the California Environmental Quality Act were embedded in a last-minute budget bill that sailed through the Senate and the Assembly. The new law exempts nine types of projects from environmental reviews: child care centers, health clinics, food banks, farmworker housing, broadband, wildfire prevention, water infrastructure, public parks or trails and, notably, advanced manufacturing.
Aiming to streamline and lower the cost of construction in California, the new law also restricts legal challenges under CEQA by narrowing which documents courts can consider. It also allows limited environmental reviews of projects that don’ t have an array of impacts. 
The changes in the 54-year-old law were forced by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who told legislators last week that he would not approve the state’s $321 billion spending plan without them. A provision in the budget act approved last week stated the spending plan “shall be inoperative and repealed” if changes to the state’s environmental review process were not final by midnight tonight.
Newsom signed the bill tonight, after it passed with overwhelming votes in the Senate and Assembly.
For decades, business and building groups have railed against what they call “CEQA abuse,” saying the environmental reviews drag out projects for years. But supporters say the law requires developers and others to examine and correct an array of environmental impacts, from air pollution to water use to traffic.
Recently, with climate change front and center, some liberals have joined calls for overhauling the environmental law, arguing that California must build faster and at scale to decarbonize its electric grid and construct housing and transportation systems.
The new exemption for “advanced manufacturing” facilities in areas already zoned for industrial use — including plants that build semiconductors and nanotech — drew some of the fiercest criticism. State law defines the category as processes that improve or create new materials, products or technologies. 
The changes were met with vehement opposition from more than 100 environmental and community groups, which said industrial plants will be more easily built in low-income communities. They also say the exemptions will advantage developers by limiting public oversight and could create legal confusion.
“This bill is the worst anti-environmental bill in California in recent memory,” a coalition of opponents, including the California Environmental Justice Alliance and the Western Center on Law and Poverty, wrote in a letter to Newsom and legislators.
“This law would not harm all California communities equally. This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”ASHA SHARMA, LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
At the over three-hour hearing preceding the vote, dozens of members of the public spoke in opposition, with some holding signs saying “When CEQA is silenced, polluters speak louder.”  
Asha Sharma, state policy manager with Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability, called the changes “a back-room, last-minute deal” that made the state budget “dependent on gutting environmental review for resource-intensive and polluting industrial projects.”
“This law would not harm all California communities equally,” Sharma said. “This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”
The Assembly approved the bill with a 50 to 3 vote, and the Senate, 33 to 1. 
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance who voted against it, raised concerns on the Assembly floor about the bill’s exemption for advanced manufacturing plants, citing the environmental opposition and urged the measure to be revisited. 
The lone senator to stand against it was Republican Roger Niello from Roseville. However, several who voiced concerns about the bill in an earlier hearing today did not vote, including Democratic state Sen. Catherine Blakespear from Encinitas and Sen. John Laird from Santa Cruz. 
Newsom said his budget maneuver was necessary and thanked the leaders of the two houses of the Legislature.
“This was too important to play chance. It was too urgent, too important to allow the (legislative) process to unfold as it has for the last generation, invariably falling prey to all kinds of pratfall,” Newsom said.
The governor’s public comments were limited as the fierce debate broke out in recent days. But his press office account posted on social media last week that “the Legislature has a chance to deliver the most significant housing and infrastructure reforms in decades.”
“This is our moment to build the California Dream for a new generation,” his office said. “We’re done with the roadblocks and delays — let’s get this done.”
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California.”STATE SEN. SCOTT WIENER
A major proponent of the exemptions, State Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said in an interview with CalMatters today that criticisms by environmentalists were  “extreme, unfounded, melodramatic statements.” 
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California,” Wiener said. “And to suggest that that kind of bill is bad for the environment — or the worst environmental bill in decades — or whatever it is they said, that’s just over the top.”
Wiener said the changes exempt manufacturing projects only on land that is already zoned as industrial. The goal is to make it easier for high-tech industries to build, with Wiener arguing that California risks losing out on major private-sector investment because it’s too costly and difficult to build in the state. 
“The environmental movement needs to ask itself: Why is it that CEQA keeps getting used to stymie climate action, whether it’s transit-oriented development or bike lanes or public transportation or phasing out oil?” Wiener said.
Several housing advocacy and business groups voiced support for the law today.  
Alex Torres, speaking on behalf of housing groups, the tech trade association Chamber of Progress, the Bay Area Council and others, said exempting advanced manufacturing from environmental review will help “the Bay Area’s competitiveness” and “shift some manufacturing opportunities to the Bay Area.” 
Several other manufacturing groups declined to comment to CalMatters about the law changes or did not respond to inquiries. 
‘Shortcutting’ legislative process
The debate today in the committee hearing included a testy exchange between senators about whether Newsom was forcing their hand. 
“We have a situation here where the executive branch is telling the Legislative branch that if it doesn’t pass this trailer bill, that the budget itself will be null and void. I have to say, that profoundly disturbs and offends me,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville, said at today’s hearing. 
Wiener fired back that all aspects of the budget and trailer bills were a three-party agreement. “We don’t have a dictatorship,” he said. 
“I wasn’t part of that three-party agreement,” Niello countered. 
Environmental and community groups also questioned the use of the budget to shortcut the legislative process, limiting public and legislative input.
“If the only way you can change state law is to keep it out of the public eye as long as possible, and condition passage of the state budget on the proposed changes, does that not show that its backers know the public wouldn’t support it if they knew the truth?” the coalition of opponents wrote to Newsom and legislators.
California lawmakers enacted CEQA in 1970 amid a rising tide of environmental awareness. It had broad bipartisan support: Gov. Ronald Reagan signed it into law, and President Richard Nixon approved its federal counterpart the same year. At the time, environmental concerns were mostly local — unchecked development, polluted waterways, pesticide use and the loss of open space.
Two years ago, in another effort to use the state budget process as leverage, Newsom proposed a series of last-minute changes to the law. That move was rejected by lawmakers.
But after years of failed attempts to rewrite the law, Democrats have begun to rally around a new message: The political conversation among Democrats in Sacramento, and across the U.S., has shifted following last year’s presidential election, with growing consensus that removing regulatory barriers is a top priority.
Still, just hours before their vote, lawmakers were grappling with how exactly the bill would affect communities on the frontlines of manufacturing, with Wiener fielding most of the questions. 
State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, asked about the definition of “advanced manufacturing.” Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, asked whether it included nuclear materials. Wiener said it did not. 
“It is a horrible day when a senator even has to ask if an exemption from environmental review includes nuclear manufacturing,” said Sharma, of the justice and accountability organization.
At the earlier committee hearing, State Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles, cited the massive cleanup of lead-contaminated soil around the battery recycling facility Exide Technologies in Vernon as a warning of the risk. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves. The toxins…can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”RAQUEL MASON, CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE
Raquel Mason, senior legislative manager with the California Environmental Justice Alliance, told senators that there have been 23 Superfund sites in Santa Clara County — in the heart of Silicon Valley, and several are related to semiconductor manufacturing. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves,” Mason said. “The toxins don’t just stay in the industrial zone facility. They can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”
Major labor group opposed to the CEQA changes
Samuel Appel, policy director at the United Auto Workers in the Western United States, which represents 100,000 workers in California, said the exemption for advanced manufacturing was especially alarming because of California’s position as a leader in the tech industry. 
“We’re concerned not only about toxic work sites that our members will be working at and organizing in. We’re concerned about the toxic communities that we’d be living in,” Appel said. “We are organizing and work in these facilities every day — at Tesla, in semiconductor facilities and in lithium and the lithium extraction industry and in aerospace. This is a giveaway for corporations, and city and local control is not enough to protect us or our communities.” 
A new law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 offers $280 billion in federal initiative aimed at boosting U.S. innovation and manufacturing in strategic technologies, especially semiconductors. The law allocates ubsidies and tax credits to incentivize companies to manufacture chips in the United States, rather than overseas.
Semiconductors are the tiny processors that power everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to fighter jets and satellites — and demand for them is growing. The pandemic exposed major vulnerabilities in global supply chains, spurring bipartisan momentum to reinvigorate chip production.
Arizona, Texas and Ohio have landed many new chip fabrication plants, in part because of lower costs and fewer regulatory hurdles. That’s why some lawmakers, including Wiener say environmental streamlining is needed if California wants to attract a significant share of manufacturing dollars.
“These are jobs of the future, there’s going to be more and more of these jobs, and I want them to be in California,” Wiener told CalMatters. “We do so much of the innovation here and the creation of this technology. I want us to benefit from the technology in terms of growth and job creation here and so, you know, I think this is a reasonable bill. 
The measures lets certain projects skip a full environmental review if they just barely miss qualifying for an exemption — for example, if they meet every requirement except one. In those cases, the review would only look at the environmental impact of that one issue, instead of analyzing the whole project. Critics say it’s confusing and could weaken protections by letting potentially harmful projects avoid deeper scrutiny.
“We find the near-miss provisions to be extremely legally confusing,” said Matthew Baker, policy director at the Planning and Conservation League. “It would take a lot, probably, for the courts to sort out. We simply don’t really understand how it would work.”
Under CEQA, lawsuits challenging a project require the agency to provide a full record — including internal emails and staff notes — but the changes exclude those internal communications from the record, except for projects involving distribution centers or oil and gas infrastructure. Critics said that will make it harder to challenge potentially harmful projects.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/032311_Semiconductor_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 22:59:05.824575

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Five and a half weeks after a fire ravaged the Matunuck Oyster Bar, the popular South Kingstown restaurant reopened Monday thanks to a revision of Rhode Island’s outdoor dining law.  
Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation amending the state’s “Take It Outside” law at a ceremony under a tent diagonally across Succotash Road from the damaged restaurant. Tables topped with flowers and chairs were arranged on a wooden floor in the tented area where al fresco dining can take place this summer in what was the restaurant’s valet parking lot. Food is prepared in a mobile kitchen trailer.
The legislation sponsored by South Kingstown Democrats, Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski was approved unanimously by both chambers of the General Assembly on June 12, a week after they were introduced. The revised law allows restaurants damaged by fire or flood to offer temporary outdoor dining for up to 18 months, as long as they receive approval from municipal officials and meet health and safety regulations. 
At the time of the May 20 fire, the Matunuck Oyster Bar employed about 300 workers. The restaurant can keep roughly 50 restaurant employees working this summer because of the revised law, officials said. The restaurant will be open daily and offer takeout service in addition to dining under the tent.
“Rhode Island may be small, but we always rally around our own,” McKee said in a statement. “I want to thank our state and local leaders who acted quickly to make this possible and to everyone who rallied around a beloved local business when it needed it the most.” 
A GoFundMe page has raised over $260,000 to help the restaurant rebuild and help employees
“The fire made me realize more than ever the importance of community,” Perry Raso, the restaurant’s owner, said during Monday’s speaking program.
The Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal is still investigating the cause of the fire but preliminary findings suggested the blaze was likely accidental in nature.

More investment in renewables will help lower Alaska's high energy costs, but the budget bill that Congress is debating would reduce renewable investments. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans pay nearly the highest percentage of their household incomes on energy of any state, and federal policy changes proposed in the budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate would make the problem worse, according to a report by the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Health Equity and three Alaska organizations.
The report found that Alaska’s energy burden — the percentage of household income that is spent on energy — is the nation’s second highest, at 4.3% compared to a national average of 2.7%. Maine has the highest average energy cost burden, at 4.5%, according to the report’s authors.
The disparities between cost burdens in urban and rural Alaska are stark, the report said. Outside of urban areas like Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, where the median costs amount to 2.3% of household income, the cost burden in rural Alaska is considered severe, the report found.
In Southwest Alaska, the residents spend an average of 12% of their household income on energy. In northern Alaska, the burden is 8.3%, according to the report, titled “Energy Burden in Alaska: Understanding Energy Burden for Alaska Communities and Charting a Path Forward.”
Along with UW’s Center for Environmental Health Equity, other organizations writing the report were Cook Inletkeeper, the Alaska Public Interest Research Group and Native Movement.
In written statements, representatives of the Alaska organizations said provisions in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” would further burden state residents, especially in rural areas.
“This report contains very timely information,” said Ben Boettger, energy policy analyst for Cook Inletkeeper. “The U.S. Senate is considering legislation that would weaken and then eliminate energy tax credits — namely the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit, threatened by the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ — that until recently weren’t available to the cooperative and municipal utilities that serve most rural Alaskans. We hope Alaska’s senators will bear in mind these extreme energy disparities as they consider where they stand in upcoming debates and votes on tax credit changes.”
The report makes a series of policy recommendations, but the proposals in the bill would make changes in the opposite direction.
The report recommends increased investment in renewable energy projects, notably in the highest-cost areas of rural Alaska. “Long term, bringing on community-scale renewable energy, especially for communities dependent on fly-in and barge-in diesel is the best and most accessible way to reduce energy burdens and support thriving communities,” the report said.
But the bill proposes to do the opposite by ending tax credits for clean energy projects and imposing new taxes on wind and solar projects. And even Elon Musk, once a close Trump adviser, has criticized those elements of the bill.
Already, more than $14 billion in clean energy projects have been eliminated this year because of Trump administration policies, according to one new analysis.
The Alaska report recommends expanding the weatherization program that helps homeowners achieve energy efficiency. Outside of the bill, the Trump administration is also seeking to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP.
Other recommendations of the Alaska report focus on state policy. Among the steps that it said should be taken at the state level is an expansion of Alaska’s Power Equalization Program, which subsidizes rural electricity. Other recommended state-level policies include full funding of the Alaska Renewable Energy Fund and more administrative support for the state’s new Green Bank, the report said.
If tax credits for clean energy are eliminated, consumers across the nation will face higher costs, according to a new report from one national organization.
The Clean Energy Buyers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based industry group, calculated costs of the credit elimination in 28 states, including Alaska.
For Alaska, the end to the tax credits will mean 600 fewer jobs, an average $170-per-household loss in income, a 0.8% increase in household electricity prices, a 0.9% increase in business electricity prices, a 2.5% increase in household natural gas prices and a 4.3% increase in businesses’ natural gas prices, according to the organization’s analysis.
It would also cause an overall $50 million decrease in state gross domestic product. Alaska’s gross domestic product growth rate currently ranks second-to-last among the U.S. states.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As President Donald Trump prepares an executive order that could end birthright citizenship for non-citizens having children in the United States, two unique federal laws could protect the citizenship rights of newborns in Alaska and Hawaii.
On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with the implementation of his order in more than half of U.S. states.
Anchorage immigration attorney Margaret Stock noted over the weekend that when it comes to Alaska and Hawaii, the federal government would have to overcome special, state-specific laws if it wants to cancel birthright citizenship.
For Alaska, a federal law passed in 1952 states specifically that “A person born in Alaska on or after March 30, 1867, … is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
The same law, elsewhere, states that “A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
No other state has a specific law establishing birthright citizenship there.
Stock said she believes those laws protect the citizenship of children born in Alaska and Hawaii, but added that she has seen the federal government violate other immigration laws.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a wide-ranging bill that could affect Medicaid, Alaska oil and gas development and the size of the federal debt. (Alaska Beacon file photos)The U.S. Senate continued nonstop debate on its major policy and budget bill Monday, as provisions affecting Alaska continued to be hotly debated.
Senators are advancing toward a vote expected as soon as Monday night, with some attempting to sway the vote of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.
Murkowski is critical to the vote, because there are 53 Republicans in the U.S. Senate, and 50 are needed to pass the bill — dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by President Donald Trump. 
Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Tillis of North Carolina have indicated that they will vote against it. If Murkowski were to join them in opposition, it would leave Vice President J.D. Vance to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor. 
If one other Republican were to also vote no, the bill would fail.
Senators are rushing to finish work ahead of the Fourth of July, an informal deadline preferred by the president.
In order to partially pay for tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, the bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid spending and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps.
Roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans receives health care through Medicaid, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the big bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans could lose health insurance if the bill passes. 
Republicans proposed $6.7 billion in additional Medicaid spending for Alaska to offset some of those cuts, but over the weekend, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that change violated the rules of the budget procedure being used to advance the bill.
Large numbers of Alaskans receive SNAP food aid from the federal government, and the bill would require states to pay for a share of that aid, which is currently fully funded by the federal government.
Alaska, which has repeatedly been scolded by the federal government for mistakes managing SNAP, would be required to pay as much as $37 million per year to keep food aid steady, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated. 
Republican senators inserted a provision into the bill that would have temporarily exempted Alaska and Hawaii from having to pay into the program, but on Monday, the Senate parliamentarian seemed likely to nix that benefit as well.
In a weekend opinion column published in the New York Times, Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Alaska Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, urged Congress to reject the bill, saying it would be bad for Alaska. By phone on Monday, Giessel said her view had not changed since that column was published.
Other parts of the bill, geared toward Alaska, remained intact: a new tax exemption for Community Development Quota fishing groups and an increase in a federal tax deduction for Alaska whaling captains.
The bill contains more than $7 billion for Coast Guard icebreakers and $300 million to homeport a newly purchased civilian icebreaker commissioned into Coast Guard service. That icebreaker is slated to be homeported in Juneau.
On Monday, Murkowski was working to amend a section of the bill that threatens to deter low-cost solar and wind power projects that could reduce energy costs in Alaska.
Currently, federal law provides tax credits that incentivize those projects, but the new bill would eliminate those credits.
In addition, as of Monday afternoon, the bill contained a new excise tax on solar and energy projects placed into service after 2027 if they use parts from China and other prohibited foreign countries.
Almost all solar and wind projects use Chinese components because of their low cost and high quality.
Murkowski was seeking a gradual phaseout of those tax credits by allowing projects to collect them as long as they begin construction by 2027. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe bill would have significant effects on oil and gas drilling in Alaska. It mandates four new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it requires other sales in Cook Inlet and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. 
Seventy percent of rental and royalty payments from those sales would go to the state of Alaska, starting in 2034, up from 50 percent currently.
That’s down from a proposed share of 90%, which was in an earlier Senate version of the bill. 
The revenue sharing is particularly important for the state because a growing proportion of North Slope oil production is coming from federal land, rather than state land, and most promising new oil finds in the North Slope are on federal land.
An earlier version of the bill proposed to ban states for 10 years from passing laws restricting AI computer software development. That’s now down to five years and has multiple exceptions.
In the Alaska Legislature, Anchorage Reps. Alyse Galvin and Andrew Gray had issued a statement asking the Senate to reconsider the 10-year ban.
A provision advancing development of the Ambler Road was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has withdrawn a proposal to sell large amounts of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.
Overall, independent analysts have found, the tax cuts within the bill will bring increased financial benefits for the wealthiest Alaskans, while the poorest Alaskans will be left worse off because their tax cuts do not equal the cost of lost federal benefits and services.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a Sunday estimate that the bill will increase the federal debt by more than $3.2 trillion over 10 years.
If the bill advances through the Senate, it will be subject to a vote in the House, where lawmakers passed a different version earlier this year.
That vote could come before the Fourth of July holiday.

Congressman Dwight Evans won’t seek reelection in 2026, announces plans to retire",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-congressman-dwight-evans-wont-seek-reelection-in-2026-announces-plans-to-retire/,Multiple Democratic lawmakers have expressed interest in potentially joining the race to succeed him.,"U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) announced on Monday that he will not run for reelection in 2026.
“After some discussions this weekend and thoughtful reflection, I have decided that the time is right to announce that I will not be seeking re-election in 2026,” he said. “Serving the people of Philadelphia has been the honor of my life. I am deeply proud of what I have been able to accomplish over my 45 years in elected office — from revitalizing neighborhoods block by block to fighting for justice, economic opportunity, investments in infrastructure and education.”
“I cannot express the gratitude that I have for the trust that voters put in me as their voice in both state and federal office,” he added. “It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve as their advocate in government.”
In May 2024, Evans suffered a stroke and did not vote for several months during his recovery. He was reelected to another term last year.  In his statement, Evans said that he is in “good health and fully capable of continuing to serve.”  He intends to serve the remainder of his current term that ends on Jan. 3, 2027.
Evans career in elected office spans several decades. He served in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly for multiple decades before he defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House.
He has cruised to reelection four times and represents a safe Democratic district, according to national ratings outlets.
Evans is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, where he serves on the Subcommittees on Health, and Worker and Family Support.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in December that multiple Democrats would be interested in running for the seat, if Evans decided to not seek reelection in 2026. A few confirmed interest in the seat following Evans announcement. Earlier this year, Evans’ first quarter fundraising total, was the lowest in the state’s congressional delegation.
State Sen. Sharif Street, who also serves as the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, said “We’ll be filing paperwork tomorrow that will answer that question.”
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) previously set up an exploratory committee for the seat in October 2023, but decided against challenging Evans.
“I had no intention of running against the congressman, but now that he has announced that he’s not running for re-election. I’m seriously considering it,” Rabb told the Capital-Star on Monday.
State Rep. Morgan Cephas, who serves as the chair of the Philadelphia caucus in the state House, told POLITICO on Monday that “me and my team are strongly considering a bid.”
Dave Oxman, a physician, and Robin Toldens, who the Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, are both Democrats who have already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District

For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to write a new roadmap that should include eliminating combined sewage overflows.
The post It’s time to give the Mystic River watershed the same clean-up we gave Boston Harbor appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NESTLED ON THE border of Cambridge and Arlington, the Alewife Brook Reservation is a serene urban wildland filled with wetlands, teeming with wildlife, and a popular oasis for residents. But it’s also the site where more than 1.6 million gallons of untreated sewage overflow — including human waste — have been dumped since the start of 2025. 
Despite tremendous progress made over the last 50 years to improve water quality throughout Greater Boston, outdated sewer infrastructure and underregulated stormwater practices continue to lead to the discharge of dangerous pollutants directly into our popular public waterways. A disproportionate number of the most egregious discharges, known as combined sewage overflows (CSOs), occur at Alewife Brook and along the Mystic River, a watershed region home to roughly 600,000 people. This poses a significant threat to their health and well-being, as well as that of critical ecosystems throughout the region.  
Fortunately, in 2025, we have an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this enduring challenge, which dates back to the cleanup of Boston Harbor, which began in the 1980s. 
For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to take what we’ve learned about improving water quality and rewrite a roadmap that should include eliminating CSOs altogether, establishing foundational strategies to protect our waterways, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, public health, and ecological health. If we miss this chance, we risk missing a crucial window for making the water our residents and neighbors recreate in and live alongside safe for everyone to enjoy for decades to come.

Constructed in the late 1800s, combined sewer overflows were designed as a connected sewer and storm drain system to ferry untreated wastewater and storm runoff into treatment plants. Today, these same pipes carry that mix of rainwater and sewage in the Boston area to the water treatment plant at Deer Island, during small rain events.  
When hit with moderate to severe rainfall events, however, these systems become overwhelmed, and — to prevent sewage from backing up into homes — divert untreated wastewater to outflows along our rivers and streams. These outflows expose communities to dangerous bacteria and other pollutants linked to severe health complications, and necessitate the all-too-frequent closure of local waterways, parks, and beaches.  
Unfortunately, incidents of discharges have become more common. As cities have grown and shifting rain patterns caused by climate change have brought heavier, more frequent precipitation events, our antiquated sewer system has struggled to keep up. Toxic water increasingly has no place to go but into areas where we work, play, and live.  
Indeed, even while dozens of CSO outflows in Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have been eliminated over the past 35 years, over 100 million gallons of raw and partially treated combined sewage were discharged into the Mystic River and its tributaries in 2024 alone. In the recently published Mystic River water quality report card, one of these tributaries, the Alewife Brook,  scored an alarming D+.  
This year, an update to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Combined Sewer Overflow Long Term Control Plan, which creates a 10-year framework for MWRA, local governments, and institutions to address the remaining combined sewer overflows impacting the Mystic, Neponset, and Charles rivers, as well as Alewife Brook, is well underway and set to be finalized and rolled out over the coming months.  
Combined with federal regulatory changes, the plan is in a position to substantially improve public health throughout Greater Boston and accelerate the progress made thus far in improving the water quality in the Mystic River watershed and the region. However, to be truly effective in ensuring our waterways are clean and safe from hazardous waste, the overriding priority of the plan must be to eliminate the discharge of sewage from combined sewer overflows completely.  
To accomplish this, any long-term control plan must be flexible and responsive to our rapidly changing climate, incorporating climate-ready solutions that prepare our cities for the heavy rain and snow events we can expect over the next decade. This means considering, whenever possible, green infrastructure solutions, such as rain gardens, bioswales, and stormwater wetlands, that provide co-benefits to communities most impacted by CSO discharges. 
Executing the long-term control plan must also be a collective effort involving municipalities, community groups, policy-makers, engineers, and the public. Transparency must be woven throughout the 10-year process — and this year’s negotiations — ensuring that infrastructure proposals are accessible to all and multiple opportunities are provided for the public to deliberate, share feedback, and react to proposals.  
Together, these essential investments in infrastructure and planning present a massive opportunity to modernize our infrastructure and better protect our waterways to reflect and serve everyone in our communities. We can no longer afford to kick these urgently needed updates down the road.  
In the 1980s, Massachusetts embarked on a massive operation to clean up Boston Harbor. Today, we are reaping the benefits of that effort — proving that we can innovate to tackle big infrastructure challenges with massive and long-term payoffs for the public good.  
We now find ourselves at another pivotal moment in the quest to improve water quality. It’s time to step up, eliminate CSOs, and implement a sustainable, long-term plan to protect the Mystic River and Alewife Brook, so that residents living along these waterways will have access to clean, healthy water now and into the future.

Part Emergency Communications drill and part informal competition, amateur radio Field Day encourages ham radio operators across the U.S. and Canada to test their equipment and skills.

Kelsey Tolchin-Kupferer is the audio story editor at the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, in partnership with Vermont Public. 

Radio waves were flying in Essex Junction this weekend as members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont joined tens of thousands of amateur — or “ham” — radio operators across North America for Field Day.
Hosted annually by the National Association for Amateur Radio, Field Day encourages licensed operators to test their skills, equipment and emergency readiness. It’s also a chance for “hams” to socialize, recruit new operators and engage in some friendly competition.
Here’s how it works:
Amateur radio operators set up temporary radio stations in remote areas like parks, parking lots and fields. They then spend 24 hours trying to make contact with as many other stations as possible using only portable equipment and emergency power like batteries and generators.

Members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont (RANV) have been participating in Field Day for more than 30 years.
“We take it extremely seriously, because the whole point of Field Day is to do an emergency communications — ‘EmComm’ — setup,” said RANV president Stewart Corey. “And it doesn’t get any more EmComm than what we’re doing.”
RANV’s setup is ambitious, with three 50-foot antenna towers and multiple stations running on generators. It takes several hours and several volunteers to assemble — and tear down — all the gear.
Still, RANV members say the real magic of amateur radio is how little it takes to connect.
“If you give me the right radio and a 12-volt battery and enough wire to string in the trees, I can talk to anywhere in the world,” said RANV member John Colt.
Colt uses his amateur radio know-how to help organize emergency communications drills at healthcare facilities across Vermont. He says when cell towers fail, the internet is down and the power goes out, ham radio operators can still get messages through.
“If you want something that will work when nothing else does, that’s amateur radio,” he said.
But emergency preparedness is only part of the appeal.
“It’s also an incredibly fun hobby,” Colt said.
Fellow RANV member Erik Wheeler agrees. He got his amateur license as a kid. 
“I walked into my teacher’s classroom — it was Travis Redman, a fantastic teacher at Rutland Town School — and there was a ham radio sitting there,” Wheeler said. “He taught me and several other students how to use it, and I’ve been hooked ever since.”

This year, Vermonters set up Field Day stations in Shaftsbury, Montpelier, Halifax, Newport, New Haven and Gateway in addition to the one in Essex Junction. Many stations encouraged members of the public to come and observe — and even get on the air.
Field Day is also an informal competition. Groups earn points for the number of stations they contact — called “QSOs” — and can earn bonus points for things like getting little kids on the air. 
RANV has placed first in the nation in its Field Day category for four years in a row. RANV operators log hundreds of contacts every hour, consistently outperforming hundreds of other ham radio clubs across the U.S. and Canada.
RANV president Stewart Corey says the club does so well because they’ve got great equipment and a dedicated team on-air for the full 24 hours. And, he said, Vermont’s location helps. 
“Because we’re up in the corner, we can face our beam southwest and hit a majority of the United States without moving it,” he said. “Geographically, we kind of get to cheat.”
Curious about ham radio? You don’t have to wait till next Field Day. Corey says RANV is always looking for new members. They meet monthly in Essex Junction.

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as battalion chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and battalion chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
 Investigation ongoing

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
 Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
 Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff. 
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
 In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)The state of Utah is suing Snapchat over features it says are designed to addict children, while potentially exposing them to illegal drug sales, predatory adults and an artificial intelligence feature that has “known risks.”
That’s according to a complaint filed on Monday in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, accusing the popular social media app of violating Utah’s Consumer Sales Practices and Consumer Privacy acts. 
It’s the latest attempt by Utah to target the legality of how social media companies interact with minors — the state has now filed four lawsuits against major social media companies, including similar complaints against Meta and TikTok. 
However, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) is accusing the state of trying to circumvent a court ruling last year that put a temporary hold on a Utah law requiring age verification for social media users. The company says it’s not against increased safety regulations, but called Utah’s demands “unconstitutional.” 
Allegations of criminal activity and ‘gambling-like features’ 
In the 90-page complaint, attorneys for the state claim Snapchat leaves children vulnerable to exploitation, misleads parents into thinking the app is safe, and has “gambling-like” features that reward continuous use and compulsive scrolling. 
The complaint cites examples where Snapchat’s artificial intelligence chatbot, My AI, was allegedly “giving a 13-year-old account advice on setting the mood for a sexual experience with a 31-year-old.” The attorney general’s office also gives several examples of drug deals and sex crimes involving Snapchat.
The complaint accuses Snapchat of knowingly incorporating and refining features that “facilitate, enable, and promote the distribution of drugs and sexual exploitation,” a violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act.   
According to the complaint, Snap incorporates features that are “designed to be addictive to children,” including push notifications, beauty filters, personalized algorithms and the My AI chatbot. Meanwhile, the company hides or disincentivizes features that could decrease the time young people spend on the app, the lawsuit claims. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Addicting children and “ensuring their continued addiction” is also in violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act, the complaint reads — as is launching the My AI feature that had “known risks to drive engagement and profit.”
The state argues Snapchat is violating the Utah Consumer Privacy Act by failing to provide customers with the “ability to opt out of the sensitive data collected through Snapchat’s My AI feature.” 
According to the lawsuit, Snap was informed of these violations in a May 2025 letter, but the company “did not cure any of the violations.” Utah is hoping a court will force Snap to follow the laws it claims the company is violating, and order restitution and other civil penalties. 
“Utah is taking a stand to protect our kids in an increasingly digital world. This lawsuit against Snap is about accountability and about drawing a clear line: the well-being of our children must come before corporate profits,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in a statement Monday. “We won’t sit back while tech companies exploit young users. It’s time for commonsense protections that ensure a safer online experience for every minor.”
Snapchat says Utah is trying to circumvent a prior court ruling 
In a statement, Snap said the company is committed to making the app a “safe and fun environment for our community, and have built privacy and safety features into our service from the start.”   
Utah changed its social media laws to avoid constitutional issues, but legal challenges persist

The lawsuit comes about a year after Utah lawmakers passed a bill requiring social media companies verify the age of their users. NetChoice, a trade association for internet companies like Google, Meta and Snap, sued the state, arguing the law violated the First Amendment — in September, a judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect. 
Now Snap is accusing the state of trying to find a way around the court ruling. 
“Unable to accept the court’s rejection of the state’s legislation, the Utah Attorney General is resorting to civil litigation as a means to circumvent the court and impose age verification requirements and age-related restrictions in ways that are unconstitutional,” a company spokesperson said in an email.  
Snap said Utah’s lawsuit imposes restrictive and “technologically unfeasible” regulations that stifle free speech. 
Billions of conversations take place on Snapchat each day, the vast majority of them to simply connect with friends and family, according to the company. Snap said it supports steps to increase online safety for children, including the recently-passed SB142, which requires Apple and Google’s app stores to verify a user’s age before making downloads. 
The company also pointed to safety features that make teen accounts and friend lists private by default, and require a Snapchat user to be “friends” with someone before they can communicate with them. Other features allow parents to see who their child is talking to and who their friends are.

A New York federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction last week that allows Job Corps centers, like the Northlands Job Corps Center in Vergennes, to remain open while the legal battle to determine their fate continues.
In issuing the order, Judge Andrew Lamar Carter, a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, stated that the arguments by lawyers for National Job Corps Association and a litany of fellow defendants — ranging from Education and Training Resources, the contractor who operates the Job Corps in Vergennes, to current Job Corps students — were largely likely to succeed. The plaintiffs all sued the U.S. Department of Labor to stop its attempt to shut down the program.
In late May, the Department of Labor told Job Corps centers across the country to “pause” all of their operations. This order would have forced Job Corps center to shut down a program that provides room, food and a vocational education to low income 16 to 24 year olds by Monday, June 30.

Instead, the department’s order would have instated what the administration characterized as a “cost-effective” $2.9 billion “Make America Skilled Again” grant program that shifts from federal programs like Job Corps to state-led registered apprenticeships, intended to train workers and provide an alternative to college.
The Job Corps centers had already been funded from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 by Congress, which previously approved $1.7 billion for the program. 
The plaintiffs in the case argued that the Department of Labor “effectively prevented new enrollment” by ending background checks starting in March, court documents show. Students attending Job Corps need to be background-checked to attend the program, but it is unclear now whether or not the government intends to resume background checks, or if they can be legally compelled to do so.The Department of Labor claimed that they had only temporarily halted Job Corps operations. However, Carter wrote in his order that the “way that the DOL is shuttering operations and the context in which the shuttering is taking place make it clear that the DOL is actually attempting to close the centers.”Carter also found that the Department of Labor did not have the power to end the program, writing that the department must “concede that, as part of the executive branch, they do not have the authority to unilaterally eliminate a congressionally mandated program like Job Corps.”Carter also stated that there were clear harms in ending the programs, citing the circumstances of a plaintiff who is a student with the Job Corps program who was previously homeless.The plaintiff “will immediately be plunged into homelessness, and she will lose all of the progress she has made in her culinary program. She would be forced to leave a stable residence and placed in a homeless shelter,” he wrote. It is “undisputed,” he wrote, that she was being harmed by the department’s actions.“The Department of Labor is working closely with the Department of Justice to evaluate the injunction. We remain confident that our actions are consistent with the law,” Ryan L. Honick, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor wrote in an email.
A student enrolled at Northlands said the injunction is “a relief.” 
“We were all kind of scrambling to figure out a plan in less than two weeks of finding a job and trying not to be homeless,” she said in an interview. VTDigger is not naming the student because of potential retaliation by the federal government. 
She said that Northlands is the first place “I’ve ever had three meals a day, and a lot of emotional support, and it’s the first place that I think a lot of kids have a safe environment to explore themselves as a person and [have] the ability to grow.”
The student, who is enrolled in an associate’s degree information technology dual-program between Northlands and the Community College of Vermont, said the opportunities provided by the program were unprecedented for her. 
“I would be the first woman in my family to get a degree,” she said. “I would probably stay in Vermont. I love it… I’d get a job in programming or software development after this. And I’d probably pursue my bachelor’s degree.”
The injunction was also cause for political celebration among Vermont’s Democratic state and federal officials. 
Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark also joined 18 other attorneys general to file an amicus brief in support of the program.Noting that she was “pleased, and not surprised,” by the court’s order, Clark added that “this order will allow Northlands Jobs Corps Center in Vergennes to continue serving young Vermonters in their journey to achieve their career goals and access stable housing.”In an emailed statement, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. called the Job Corps “a critical training ground and opportunity pipeline for so many Vermonters.”
“I was pleased to see it remain open and operating for the time being,” she wrote. “But the Trump administration remains adamant in ripping away these programs that give Americans a fair shot at success – while training the exact trades workers that Vermont so desperately needs. I’ll keep fighting every step of the way to keep these funds going to the programs just as Congress mandated.”U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. signed a letter with thirty eight other Senators urging the Department of Labor “to immediately reverse this decision to prevent a lapse in education and services for Job Corps students.”The injunction comes at a time where the Trump administration is butting heads with the judicial branch, as many of President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive actions have been repelled by various federal judges through nationwide injunctions.On June 27, Carter ordered parties involved in the Job Corps battle to file motions arguing whether or not the recent Supreme Court decision — which limited federal judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions — would impact the injunction he filed by June 30. The Department of Labor requested an extension that may push the filing date to July 11.Carter also denied any order to stay the case, meaning the battle for the future of the Job Corps seems poised to continue.

Jeff Landry signs legislation on June 30, 2025. (Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry taunted a member of his own party during a press conference Monday, accusing the Republican senator of killing a bill that Landry claims would have helped lower insurance rates. 
Landry invited members of the press to a ceremony Monday in which he signed into law a group of bills, including eight different measures aimed at lowering the cost of auto and homeowner insurance costs. The governor took turns listing and explaining each of the new laws while thanking the legislators who authored them, most of whom stood behind Landry as he spoke.  
Absent from that list was House Bill 677, a measure that would have regulated attorney advertising, prohibiting lawyers from making or including any kind of misleading or deceptive claims in advertisements about the amount of money a client received from a lawsuit. 
 Insurance companies have faulted personal-injury attorneys for Louisiana’s auto insurance crisis. Landry supported the bill as an effort to tamp down what some see as a litigious environment perpetuated by a group of trial lawyers well-known for their constant barrage of commercials and billboards. 
There are several questions about whether such restrictions on attorney advertising would be constitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled lawyers had a right to advertise based on First Amendment grounds in a 1977 Arizona case which opened the floodgates for so-called “billboard lawyers” media buys. 
Nevertheless, the governor claimed the attorney advertising bill would have passed but for a single lawmaker — Republican Sen. Alan Seabaugh of Shreveport. 
“We tried to rein in lawyer advertising,” Landry said to the room of journalists and spectators. “Sen. Seabaugh seemed to not be able to come to work that day, and that bill died. I want you to know we tried. Last time we tried that bill, the [former] governor vetoed it. This time a senator couldn’t show up for work. Maybe we’ll get it done next year.”
The governor was referring to Seabaugh’s two-week absence, from May 19-29, during which the bill came up for a committee vote. Seabaugh, a lawyer, said he was stuck in a jury trial defending a nursing home being accused of wrongful death in Bossier Parish — a case he ended up winning. 

The advertising bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Kim Carver, R-Mandeville, had cleared the House in mid-May on a 75-25 vote and advanced to the Senate Judiciary A Committee, of which Seabaugh is a member. 
Carver, who did not return a request for comment Monday, brought his bill to the committee on May 28 where it failed to advance in a 3-1 party-line vote with Democrats holding an advantage due in part — but not entirely — to Seabaugh’s absence. 
“I don’t know where he’s coming from throwing shade on me for missing a vote that wouldn’t have mattered,” Seabaugh said in a phone interview Monday. “It was a 3 to 1 vote, so me not being there never affected the outcome.”  
The other Republican who missed the vote was Sen. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge. Edmonds, who is pastor, said he was present every day during the session but was presenting a separate bill in a House committee at the same time as the Judiciary A members were voting on Carver’s proposal.
Seabaugh said the governor is blaming him out of spite for having voted against a different bill that Landry helped write and shepherd through the Legislature — House Bill 148, a controversial measure that Landry signed into law following an ongoing public feud with another Republican elected official, Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple. 
 “He’s mad at me for voting against House Bill 148,” Seabaugh said, noting that his vote on the proposal, like with the Carver bill, made no difference to its outcome.
Seabaugh cited the same grudge as the reason why Landry vetoed one of his insurance bills on the last day of the regular session. In an interview that day, the senator said he felt blindsided by the veto because he thought he had the governor’s support. He contrasted Landry with former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat.  
“John Bel would call and tell me when he vetoed a bill,” Seabaugh said at the time. “Jeff didn’t.”
After fielding only a few questions from the press at Monday’s bill signing, the governor did not respond to a request for further comment later on Monday.

The statewide public media network would lose $2.5 million in programming and operational funds if President Donald Trump’s desired cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting come to fruition, interim executive director Sajni Kumpuris told the commission earlier this month. She said Monday that the $2.5 million CPB grant Arkansas PBS receives accounts for 51% of the network’s operating expense funding.

Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, and PBS affiliate stations renew their memberships and pay their dues at the turn of the fiscal year.
About half of the at-risk $2.5 million community service grant goes toward purchasing PBS programs to air, 30% of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters, Kumpuris said last month. Public television stations without PBS memberships cannot access this national programming.
Arkansas PBS usually collects more than $3 million per year in individual donations, and 80% of those who donate online cite programming as their reason for giving, said Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network.
Individual donations would likely “nosedive” if the network no longer aired national PBS programming, Betley said. Some of the revenue from donations goes to the network’s operational expenses while some goes to foundation staff salaries, among other things, she said.
The foundation’s executive committee agreed last week to cover up to $1.8 million in lost federal funding if Congress approves the Trump administration’s proposed Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Betley said.
“That amount is a combination of drawing from reserves that the foundation has built over many years as well as a portion of emergency reserves that we have set aside,” she said. “But there is also a portion of it that would come from a public campaign that would basically say, ‘This is specifically to address cuts at the federal level.’”
Arkansas PBS has already agreed to make cuts to cover the remainder of the potential federal funding loss, Betley said.
Besides purchasing programming, the network’s at-risk federal grant covers operational expenses, such as running the public media network’s Conway studio and its statewide emergency weather alert system, Kumpuris said last month.

Maria Sullivan and Chairman West Doss were the only commissioners to vote against renewing the contract, saying they were unwilling to commit to it without reading the terms first.
“We would be fiscally irresponsible to commit to something this afternoon, which is what PBS says we have to do, when we don’t know where they stand, where their funding is or if they’re going to exist,” Doss said.
Attorney William Puddephatt, the commission’s counsel, said PBS’ national headquarters has not answered his or the commission’s questions about the contract in sufficient detail.
Former commission chairwoman Annette Herrington said the renewed contract should not be substantially different than in previous fiscal years. She made the motion to renew the contract “to continue to serve all Arkansans with the programming that we have provided in the past.”
Programs the network would have lost if it had disaffiliated from the national network included Antiques Roadshow and PBS Kids 24/7, Kumpuris said. Arkansas PBS would also have reverted to its previous name, the Arkansas Educational Television Network.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)When dawn broke Monday on the Pennsylvania Capitol it was a foregone conclusion that lawmakers would miss the midnight deadline to approve the next state budget.
This marks the fourth year in a row the budget will be late, failing to meet the June 30 deadline. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly offered scant insight into what’s causing the impasse and how long it might last.
For most Pennsylvanians, the lack of a budget will have few immediate noticeable effects. But if the gridlock persists into late July, it could result in financial stress for local governments, school districts, and nonprofits that receive taxpayer dollars from the spending plan.
Shapiro told reporters at a public appearance Monday that his staff and majority leaders from the Senate Republican and House Democratic caucuses had a busy weekend of meetings.
“We were all personally engaged. I think we made real progress, and we’re going to continue to make progress,” Shapiro said. “We understand what the issues are, and we are working through the solutions on those issues. I think the temperature is way down.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Republicans, who control the Senate, said that while they’ve acted on several “key components of the budget, to fund certain government functions,” they are focused on the state’s negative cashflow, as Shapiro’s plan would again dip into the state’s $11 billion surplus.
“Pennsylvania is facing a multi-billion-dollar structural deficit that we must address this year to prevent a financial crisis and tax increases in the future. Better aligning revenues with expenditures remains our top priority,” a statement from Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Appropriations Committee Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) said.
Since February, when Shapiro delivered his proposed $51.5 billion spending plan for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, Democratic lawmakers in the House have been working to pass legislation to enact Shapiro’s policy goals.
They included increases in funding for basic education, special education and school repairs, and another $526 million installment in adequacy payments to the state’s poorest school districts. The House passed legislation to reign in costs for online charter schools, setting school districts’ tuition payments at $8,000 per pupil across the state to free up $378 million a year.
The chamber has also passed legislation to provide a larger share of state sales tax revenue for public transit agencies across the state, including the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which last week passed a budget that would cut its services by nearly half.
Shapiro also proposed $750 million in additional money for highways over the next five years by shifting fuel taxes and license fees away from the state police, since Republican lawmakers have insisted on transportation improvements for rural communities and industry.
The GOP-led Senate, meanwhile, has been circumspect about options to increase tax revenue, voting down a House bill to legalize and tax marijuana for recreational use and is deeply divided on a plan to tax slot machine-like skill games that have proliferated in corner stores and social halls across the state.
Shapiro has proposed a 52% tax on skill games, which is in the neighborhood of the state’s 54% tax on casino gaming. Pace-O-Matic, the predominant producer of the machines, has lobbied for a 16% tax, while Senate Republican leaders have offered a compromise of 35%. The division has given rise to a bitter fight between Senate leaders and powerhouse lobbying firms they accuse of running an attack campaign against GOP lawmakers, Spotlight PA reported.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said Wednesday that transit funding remains a priority.
“The bottom line is that mass transit is good for Pennsylvania’s economy, not just for any region in particular, but for the whole economy,” Harris told reporters. “It helps us fund a lot of the other things that are part of this budget. How do people get to work? How do they get to school? How do they get to their doctor’s appointment? Many of them are getting there via mass transit, and that’s in rural, suburban and urban areas across this commonwealth.”
Business leaders have noted counties across the commonwealth also benefit directly from SEPTA’s employment, procurement, and commerce. 
“Over the past five years, SEPTA has awarded over $1.14 billion in contracts to Pennsylvania-based companies in 39 counties, with an average annual investment of $228 million. That’s not just rail cars and bus routes in the southeast — that’s steel, rubber, electronics, parts, safety equipment, and professional services supporting jobs across the Commonwealth,” Laura Manion, president and CEO of the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry, and Mike Grigalonis, president & COO of the Chester County Economic Development Council, wrote in support of the transit funding increase.
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told reporters Monday afternoon that his caucus has also been active in negotiating and focused on reducing the overall spending amount while fixing the structural deficit in which the state continues to spend more than it takes in.
“We believe that the No. 1 way to get ourselves out of what we’re facing in the next couple of years is through economic growth,” Topper said, adding that energy production and education to prepare young people for the workforce are priorities.
“We have a demographics issue in (Pennsylvania). We know that, and we have to make sure that our public policy during this time, as we talk about the budget, reflects the need for change in that area,” he said.
The Senate recessed Monday evening with no immediate plan to reconvene, while the House is scheduled to return to session Tuesday morning.
Harris said the stalemate over new revenue sources doesn’t necessarily prevent the General Assembly from passing a budget.
“We have the finances to produce this year’s budget if necessary, but we put all of our cards on the table, and we’re … still waiting for the negotiations to continue,” he said. “I think today, being the 30th, may help us move forward, hopefully getting this thing done.”

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
 

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
Law enforcement have not released the names of the killed and injured firefighters, or a motive for the shooting.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
  Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing. 

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
  Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened 

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
  Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff 

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
  In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers 

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
 

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further.

Maria Collett and Democratic senators at a press conference opposing the proposed U.S. budget on June 30 (Capital-Star photo by Ian Karbal)As Republicans in the U.S. Senate make a final push to pass President Donald Trump’s signature domestic policy bill, Democrats in the state Senate are calling the legislation “unconscionable.”
“I refuse to stay silent as we watch far-right politicians attempt the largest cut to health care in American history, all so the richest 1% of Americans can receive $138 billion in tax cuts,“ Sen. Maria Collett (D-Montgomery), said at a press conference Monday. “My constituents have been calling me nonstop asking me and my colleagues to stand up to the chaos they see in Washington, to stand up to their healthcare access and their ability to afford day-to-day expenses,”
The budget bill would make substantial cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, while increasing funding for the military, border security and immigration enforcement, as well as  extending tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy Americans. The bill will also eliminate subsidies for clean energy projects, including a number planned or underway in Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget office has estimated the bill will add more than $3 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, and could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing health insurance.
The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services has said it could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and an additional 270,000 could lose access to Affordable Care Act marketplace plans through Pennie with the elimination of enhanced premium tax credits that make monthly insurance bills more affordable.
“The cuts that are coming out of Washington that are proposed are unconscionable,” Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), the chair of the state Democratic Party said. “Medicaid is the health insurance for so many of the most vulnerable folks in our community.”
Republicans, however, have deemed the cuts as necessary. 
Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick has said that the bill doesn’t cut Medicaid, but slows spending growth, which he says has ballooned too quickly. The cuts, he said, would ensure that the program can continue to protect services for more vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the disabled and the mentally ill.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said at a town hall earlier this month. “We want to ensure that Medicaid is designed to protect the vulnerable people for whom it was designed, and so the legislation that’s in the Senate would slow the growth of Medicaid. It wouldn’t cut Medicaid.”
The bill is being passed through what’s called the reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass the filibuster and pass the bill with a simple majority vote. 
Since passing the House last month, it’s undergone substantial changes as Trump and Republican leaders attempt to appease dueling factions of a divided party that can only afford to lose a small handful of votes.  
Primarily, the party is split between members concerned about the bill’s overall price tag and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
As of Monday, the Senate has been considering dozens of amendments to the bill. If passed, it will return to the House for further amendment or a final vote.
“It is ugly, it is hurtful, it is painful,” said Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “We as Senate Democrats are sending a message to people right now that it is not too late. You can still make a phone call. You can still reach out to your senator.”

(Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)MINNEAPOLIS —Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”
Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.
Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet”:
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
Williams then said, “We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.”
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)  Basin Electric Power Cooperative officials testified Monday that data centers are not behind the need for a natural gas-fired power plant in northwest North Dakota but it is getting requests from potential large-load customers. 
Basin officials made comments Monday at a Public Service Commission hearing in Williston on its proposed Bison Generation Station near Epping in eastern Williams County. 
The project would generate electricity from natural gas that is abundant in North Dakota’s oil-producing region. It also would generate power by using steam produced by the plant to turn turbines.  
The nearly $4 billion Bison Generation Station would be the first combined-cycle power plant in North Dakota. 
Basin Electric describes the project as one of the largest power generation projects in the cooperative’s history.
Benjamin Hertz, manager of power supply planning for Basin Electric, said the company is  forecasting higher levels of power use from traditional customers. 
“Much of this is due to oil and gas related activity in this region,” Hertz testified Monday. 
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Basin Electric, which provides power to smaller electric co-ops, last week announced it is developing a program to deal with large-load customers such as data centers. 
Hertz said Basin Electric has been approached with a great number of large load requests throughout its service territory that could require more power generation. 
“Basin Electric has resolved to plan for new large loads and data centers separately from its traditional load growth,” Hertz said. “This program has been designed to protect Basin Electric’s  existing member rate-payers.” 
The Bison Generation Station would have two roughly 745-megawatt units to produce about 1,490 megawatts of power. 
Jody DeLong testified as chair of the board for North Dakota Native Vote and as a concerned citizen. 
He questioned the need for such a large power plant, especially if it is not needed for data centers. 
He called the project a “$4 billion gamble” with no explanation for how it will benefit rate-payers while adding to greenhouse gas emissions. 
“There’s no clear, detailed load data for local communities, including the Mountrail-Williams Electric Cooperative, or other cooperatives in North Dakota, which would demonstrate an urgent or unmet energy need among residents,” DeLong said. 
The three-person Public Service Commission regulates for-profit electric utilities but not for member-owned cooperatives. 
Construction on the project could begin this year with the power plant being fully in service in 2030.
At peak construction in 2027, the project would employ about 1,000 people. It would employ about 50 people when complete. 
The PSC took no action after Monday’s hearing. Basin Electric will provide commissioners with more information in the coming weeks. 
In addition to PSC approval, the project will need a permit from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality.

Mike Kehoe released his budget plan during the State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe made his first round of budget vetoes hurt Missouri lawmakers where it matters most, in the earmarked state funds they added to spending plans this year.
Kehoe on Monday signed the package of 13 spending bills passed by lawmakers this year, but not before vetoing $300 million in general revenue items and putting a hold on spending for $211 million more.
The list of cuts eliminated 109 of the 248 earmarked items tracked by The Independent throughout the budget process. Another 23 were reduced by the Republican governor’s use of the line-item veto and 23 more are under restriction, meaning the only way the money will be spent is if Kehoe specifically orders it or lawmakers vote to override him.
The cuts were necessary, Kehoe said in a news release, because state revenues are being squeezed by extra spending for public schools he did not support, tax cuts he does support and the cost of disaster relief from a major tornado in St. Louis and storms in other parts of the state.
In all, Kehoe issued 208 line-item vetoes and put restrictions on 32 expenditure items. The budget passed by lawmakers, the release said, had 450 items and nearly $775 million spending Kehoe did not recommend.
“We want to assure Missourians that this action is not indicative of a larger economic problem, as our economy remains strong and resilient,” Kehoe said in the release. “Just as President Trump and the federal government is reigning in spending, the State of Missouri must do the same. While we do not have an economic problem in Missouri, we do have a spending problem in state government.”
The vetoes and spending restrictions come despite a historically healthy state surplus and revenues for the current fiscal year that are exceeding expectations. Through Friday, revenues for the current fiscal were $216 million more than anticipated when the budget was written and $31 million more than an updated estimate made in December.
That will change in the coming year and beyond, the release said.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”
In the letters accompanying his budget actions, Kehoe refers regularly to the revenue issue as his basis for vetoes and restrictions.
“A course correction in state finances is not only warranted but will be constitutionally required to achieve a balanced budget in future years and safeguard Missouri’s financial security and AAA bond rating going forward,” Kehoe wrote.
When Kehoe released his budget proposal in January, it anticipated the state would end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion. At that time, the unobligated surplus at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected at $1.4 billion, but during the recent special session state Budget Director Dan Haug told lawmakers he expects no more than half that amount — $600 million to $700 million — will remain on June 30, 2026.
  Missouri Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough, right, discusses a budget item May 8 with House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton during negotiations over the fiscal 2026 budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Kehoe is wrong to use uncertainty about future revenues and the size of the remaining surplus to justify his cuts, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said in an interview with The Independent.
He told the governor that in a conversation last week, Hough said.
“He said revenues aren’t really coming in where we thought they were,” Hough said. “And I said, ‘Well, governor, I hate to disagree with you on this, but it’s actually about a percent over what we agreed on for the (consensus revenue estimate) as far as I know right now.”
Lawmakers approved $53.4 billion in spending for the coming year, including $16 billion in general revenue. Kehoe’s actions reduced the total budget to $50.8 billion and $15.5 billion in general revenue. A large portion of the overall reduction is from Kehoe vetoing changes in how federal highway funds are managed.
Major new spending items in the budget include:

A $300 million increase for the foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools.
$107 million to revamp the child care payment system so providers receive their money at the beginning of each month for the children enrolled in their center.
$50 million to expand the number of children served by the MOScholars voucher program, which helps parents pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
A state employee pay raise plan based on longevity, with raises up to 10%, plus pay increases for Department of Corrections officers who work in high-security and administrative segregation areas.
Almost $93 million to pay off a judgment against the state for damages claimed by a vendor who worked on the state’s computerized Medicaid enrollment system. A $23 million judgment grew to more than $50 million as the state appealed and interest accrued. The appropriation includes both state and federal funds to allow flexibility in the way the judgment is paid.

The surplus revenue being used by lawmakers and Kehoe in the budget approved Monday represents money accumulated when tax collections increased at double-digit rates for two years and the state substituted federal COVID relief funds for general revenue spending.
The state collected $13.4 billion in general revenue last year and the consensus revenue estimate released in December projected receipts would decline by about 0.6% in the current fiscal year. Revenues through Friday were up by about 0.4%.
The projected increase in revenue for the coming year has evaporated because of a tax cut bill enacted by lawmakers that is awaiting Kehoe’s signature and possible revenue reductions due to federal tax changes.
The new tax break would allow investors to reap the profits from long-term capital gains — the increase in value of an asset held for 12 months or longer — without paying state income tax. The bill also would expand the “Circuit Breaker” tax credit intended to offset property taxes for lower-income seniors and people with disabilities.
The tax changes being debated at the federal level are also likely to lower Missouri tax collections. The House-passed version of the budget reconciliation bill would reduce Missouri tax receipts by at least $170 million in the coming year, experts have said, while changes to benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps could shift hundreds of millions of costs from federal to state taxpayers.
The vetoes and restrictions can be reversed by legislative override votes, which would take place in September. The vetoes and restrictions include, for example, almost every general revenue-funded road project added by lawmakers, including projects in Hough’s district, the district of Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, and House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
One item important to Deaton, $19 million to buy land in McDonald County for a state park in his district, drew a second veto, but most of the money made it through. Kehoe cut $7.5 million from the appropriation, while Gov. Mike Parson, who left office in January, vetoed a similar appropriation in its entirety a year ago.
Whether any of the vetoes or restrictions will be overridden will depend on how mad people are about them, Hough said.
“It just depends on what the specific line would be that would rise to the level of irritating people enough to the point where they say, ‘We want to go override the governor in his first year,’” Hough said.
This article was updated at 6:20 p.m. to correct the amount vetoed from the McDonald County park funding.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)New Iowa laws on issues from transgender civil rights protections to changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance tax system will be officially enacted Tuesday.
July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, is when most laws passed during a legislative session begin enforcement. However, there are some measures that have other start dates – for example, warnings will begin Tuesday for violations of Senate File 22, the law banning the use of cellphones while driving outside of hands-free or voice activated modes, but criminal charges will not start until January 2026.
Additionally, there are also several education-related laws that take effect July 1, but will not be enacted until the 2025-2026 school year begins.
Here’s what to know about some of the changes in Iowa Code taking effect:
Gender identity in the Iowa Civil Rights Act: The first bill Reynolds signed in the 2025 legislative session was  Senate File 418, removing gender identity as a protected class in the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As the measure takes effect, there will no longer be legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education for transgender individuals or others who have been denied access to these services or opportunities because of their gender identity.
This new law directly relates to another measure going into effect Tuesday through the state’s Health and Human Services appropriations bill, House File 1049. The law bans Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans seeking gender-affirming health care, like sex reassignment surgery, hormone treatment therapy and other physical health care treatments for gender dysphoria. Previous attempts to enact a ban on Medicaid coverage for gender-related health care were struck down in court because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act.

Unemployment insurance taxes: Iowa will collect less in unemployment insurance taxes from employers with the enactment of Senate File 607. The law cuts the taxable wage base used in collecting unemployment insurance taxes from employers in half, from 66.7% to 33.4%, in addition to making changes to employer contribution rates. When signing the bill into law in early June, Reynolds said the change was “long overdue” in correcting overpayments into the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund .
Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: “Strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, can see expedited relief in courts under House File 472. SLAPP lawsuits are cases brought by an entity against news organizations or activists to suppress public speech or reporting on an issue by engaging in an expensive, drawn-out legal battle. The new law will allow these lawsuits – court actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press – to be addressed more quickly. The law passed includes a caveat that anti-SLAPP protections cannot be applied retroactively, meaning that only lawsuits filed July 1 onward are eligible for expedited relief.
Citizenship verification for voters: House File 954 allows registered voters to have their citizenship status challenged at the polls. However, supporters of the measure and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, who proposed the law, say it also contains provision that will prevent the need for widespread voter eligibility challenges similar to what happened in the 2024 election, by allowing the Secretary of State’s office to verify citizenship status of registered voters before an election through contracts with state and federal agencies, as well as private entities.
The measure also includes a ban on ranked choice voting, though this component of the bill does not go into effect until Jan. 1, 2026.
Election recounts: The process for conducting – and calling –  election recounts in Iowa will be different under House File 928. Initial election results must be within a threshold of 1% or 50 votes, whichever is less, and within a 0.15% difference for recounts in statewide and federal races, for a candidate to request a recount under the new law. Previously, candidates could request a recount with no limitations on the margin of victory in initial results, though the state would only cover the costs of a recount if results were within one percentage point.
The law also changes the composition of election recount boards to be led by the county auditor, with staff and hired election workers making up the boards. An equal number of workers from each political party is required.
Pharmacy benefit managers: The law setting regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs),  Senate File 383, is a measure some pharmacists and supporters say will help keep rural and independent pharmacies across the state in business. The law stops PBMs, the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies, from engaging in certain business practices that push consumers to use mail-order or specific pharmacies, like the use of financial incentives or penalties. It also sets a dispensing fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription filled at rural and small pharmacies.
Though the law will be enacted Tuesday, a lawsuit from several businesses and organizations filed in late June is seeking to overturn the measure.
Firearm age limits: The minimum age to own and carry handguns, like pistols and revolvers, is lowered from age 21 to age 18 by House File 924. While buying a handgun from a federally licensed firearm dealer would still be banned for 18- to 20-year-olds under federal restrictions, the measure makes a change that lawmakers said addresses recent federal court decisions that found similar laws restricting firearms for adults under age 21 were unconstitutional.
Here are 11 new Iowa laws that include criminal penalties

Cellphones in school: With rules set to take effect as K-12 schools return for the 2025-2026 school year, House File 782 requires public K-12 school districts set policies that, at minimum, restrict the use of cellphones during instructional periods. The measure, one of Reynolds’ priorities for the 2025 legislative session, includes exceptions, such as students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves the use of a cellphone or other device in their accommodations, and when a school district approves a parent’s request for their child to retain access to their phone because of a “legitimate” reason related to their mental or physical health.
Fetal development instruction: Senate File 175 requires Iowa schools’ human growth and development classes for students in grades 5-12 include fetal development videos and graphics that depict “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.” The content shown in schools to meet this requirement cannot come from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or that contract, affiliate, or make referrals to organizations which perform or promote abortions.
Threat assessment teams: Senate File 583 allows K-12 public school districts, private schools and charters schools to establish threat assessment teams to prevent school shootings and violence. These teams, which can be made up of school officials, law enforcement, mental health and social services workers, are able to share “reasonably necessary” information about students if their behavior is deemed a potential safety risk to other students or school staff.

Dockter chose not to appeal the decision, according to the commission. The commission concluded that in this circumstance, it’s up to the Legislature to decide whether disciplinary action is necessary.
Dockter is the partial owner of a company that leases a building located at 1720 Burlington Drive in south Bismarck to the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services. At one point, North Dakota Information Technology was also a tenant, according to the report.
In 2023, Dockter voted in favor of two budget bills that set aside money for the Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services leases. State law and ethics rules forbid lawmakers from voting on legislation that could give them a unique financial benefit.
Eight different people submitted complaints about Dockter raising concerns about the building deal in September and October 2022, according to the report.
More than two-and-a-half years since the complaints were first filed, the Ethics Commission has concluded that these votes represented two violations of its conflict of interest rules.
Additionally, a 12-person Burleigh County jury last year found Dockter guilty of a criminal misdemeanor for casting the votes. The Ethics Commission considers this conviction a third ethical violation. A district court judge ordered him to complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,500 fine, in addition to 360 days of unsupervised probation. Dockter has completed those requirements, court records indicate.
Dockter did not respond to a request for comment sent to the attorney representing the company that owns the building, Monte Rogneby.
The commission recounted the lengthy saga of the building deal in its report, which drew from sources including witness interviews, court records and state investigations.
The report notes that Dockter’s violations “likely could have been avoided with education on how to disclose and manage conflicts of interest.”
“It is clear from the commission’s investigation there is a general lack of clarity on what a potential conflict of interest is and how to disclose and manage them when they come up,” the report states.
Jury finds Rep. Dockter guilty of misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charge

The commission’s report includes excerpts from a November 2024 interview of Dockter conducted by Ethics Commission staff. In the interview, Dockter stated that he did not believe at the time he cast the votes that that was breaking any ethics laws or rules. 
His reasoning included, among other things, that the bills did not single him out specifically, that the leases were only one small part of the budgets and that his votes wouldn’t have changed the outcome of the legislation.
The commission also discovered that Dockter partially owns three other Bismarck properties that are leased or were previously leased to state entities:

601 Channel Drive, which was previously leased to the Highway Patrol and is now rented to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
1700 Schafer St., which is leased to Bismarck State College
1838 E Interstate Ave., which is leased to the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy

The commission says that its conflict of interest rules don’t set specific penalties for violators, so the agency did not penalize Dockter for the violations.  
According to the commission, the Legislative Assembly can make a determination of whether Dockter violated House rules requiring lawmakers to declare conflicts on bills they have special interests with. It also has the discretion to pursue disciplinary action against Dockter.
Dockter during the 2025 legislative session declared conflicts of interest on bills multiple times, the report states.
The Ethics Commission said that it ran into several roadblocks that stalled the completion of its investigation into Dockter. It had to the investigation on hold while the criminal case against him proceeded, for one.
The commission also struggled to get agencies including the Attorney General’s Office and Legislative Council to turn over records. 
Legislative leaders to discuss ethics rules after guilty verdict

According to the commission, the Attorney General’s Office declined to provide some email records and documents from a Montana investigation commissioned by the state into the building deal. The agency did provide some other requested records, however, the report states.
The Attorney General’s Office also did not respond to the North Dakota Monitor’s request for comment Monday.
The Ethics Commission also was unable to obtain Dockter’s legislative emails. Lawmaker emails are not public records, though emails of other state officials are public. Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said he needed either a waiver from Dockter or a subpoena to provide the emails, according to the Ethics Commission’s report. The commission declined to pursue the emails.
Additionally, some witnesses — including Bureau of Criminal Investigation Division Director Lonnie Grabowska and Liz Brocker, former executive assistant to Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem — refused requests for interviews from the commission. Grabowska instead asked for questions to be sent over email which he said would “allow for the exchange of question and answer in an effective manner,” according to the report.
The Ethics Commission noted it does not have a clear way to obtain a subpoena to compel people to sit for interviews or force agencies to produce records.
The report also called on the Legislature, the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee and the Office of the State Auditor to look into lingering questions regarding the lease deal.
Sources cited in the report dispute whether all of the money that went into the property was authorized by the Legislature. For one, the money the Attorney General’s Office spent on the building ultimately went more than $1.5 million over its initial estimate.
The report notes that the property and the Attorney General’s Office have been unable to mutually settle the financials of the building renovation.
The Ethics Commission also suggests the Office of State Auditor should consider conducting a more comprehensive performance audit of the Attorney General’s Office regarding the building project. 
It’s unclear what steps the Legislature might take with respect to the commission’s recommendations. House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 
The Ethics Commission was established in 2018 by a voter-initiated amendment to the state constitution. It’s tasked with promoting ethical behavior in the areas of elections, transparency, corruption and lobbying.

Nicholas Scutari talks with Sen. Bob Smith in the Statehouse in Trenton on Monday, June 30, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers approved a $58.8 billion spending bill in votes that largely fell along party lines just hours before a deadline that would have sent the state government into a shutdown.
The budget, which Gov. Phil Murphy must sign before midnight, maintains a full pension payment and promises to send more than $12 billion to aid the state’s K-12 schools, but it dips into state reserves to support a structural deficit that has expanded above the levels Murphy pitched in February.
“What does this budget include? It includes record amounts of property tax relief. It includes fully funding the pension payment for the fifth year in a row, fully funding the school funding formula,” said Sen. Paul Sarlo, the chamber’s budget chairman.
The Senate approved the bill in a 26-13 vote, while the Assembly approved it in a 52-27 vote with one abstention.
The governor is expected to sign the bill later Monday. It’s unclear whether he’ll employ a line-item veto that could strike specific spending items without spiking the entire spending bill.
Democratic lawmakers praised the bill for its reversals of some cuts proposed by Murphy.
“I think the budget came out pretty well. There’s a tremendous amount of spending on really important things,” said Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union)
The plan includes a $6.7 billion surplus the state is forecasted to maintain at the end of the fiscal year that begins July 1. While reduced from the record levels seen in recent years — the state’s reserves pushed to above $10 billion in fiscal year 2024 but have since been reduced by deficit spending — the surplus is still among the largest in state history.
The budget will continue to run a structural deficit. Spending levels in the bill exceed revenue — including from one-shot sources that cannot or will not recur in the fiscal year that begins in July 2026 — by $1.5 billion, down from $2.1 billion the prior year but up from the $1.2 billion Murphy proposed in February.
Republican members criticized the spending bill’s size and breakneck passage. Those misgivings have become something of a yearly exercise for GOP lawmakers who have seen the budget swell from the $35.5 billion approved in Chris Christie’s final year as governor.
“The truth about the budget is that it continues us on an unsustainable path. The budget does not make New Jersey more affordable. We are once again spending too much,” said Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz (R-Union), the chamber’s GOP budget officer.
Much of those increases can be attributed to heightened pension payments and school aid, which have risen by nearly $8.8 billion under Murphy.
“We can all agree this budget spends more than Gov. Murphy’s budget in 2018. But why? Let’s talk about where the budget growth has been focused. The top six drivers in spending growth are the following: the pension payment, school funding, direct property tax relief, Medicaid health benefits, and programs for the developmentally disabled,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the chamber’s budget chair.

The budget includes payments under Stay NJ, a property tax relief program that promises to halve seniors’ property tax bills, to a cap of $6,500. Stay NJ will pay a half-year’s benefit in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Republicans also derided new taxes both chambers approved Monday. Those include higher fees on the sale of properties worth more than $2 million, casinos’ online wagering wins, cigarettes, and electronic cigarette fluid.
The budget has faced criticism from other corners, including from high-ranking members of the administration. Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh railed against a provision that would bar officials from blocking Medicaid payments to low-performing nursing homes.
“If the budget passes without changes, the Legislature will be on the side of bad nursing homes that harm New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents — without even giving the public a chance to weigh in,” Walsh warned on social media Sunday.
Attorney General Matt Platkin railed against provisions that would divert $45 million in opioid settlement money to the state’s general fund, arguing those dollars were meant to fund addiction treatment and not be used to support overall state spending.
Others took aim at diversions from the state’s Clean Energy Fund. NJ Transit is set to receive $140.1 million in clean energy money in the coming July-to-June fiscal year, and the budget would pull an additional $50 million of its dollars into the general fund.
The diversions have irked progressive and environmental groups that charge money from the fund should be used for renewable energy projects. They said pulling its funds into the state budget could delay generation capacity that could push down spiking electricity prices.
“The public is being told we’re making progress in making our state’s energy system more affordable and reliable, but the budget tells a very different story,” said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. “We urge lawmakers to reverse this raid and deliver a budget that invests in the future, not robs from it.”
Antoinette Miles, state director for the New Jersey Working Families Party, said the spending bill does too little to insulate New Jersey from expected federal cuts that could deprive it of between $2.5 and $5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars. The budget, she said, “fails to meet the moment.”
Business groups welcomed some parts of the budget — like sales tax exemptions for baby items like cribs and tax credits for manufacturers — they chiefly worried it would make New Jersey businesses less competitive.

OMAHA — Richard Randall Sr. was a fan of President Donald Trump’s crusade to beef up border security — that is, until a wrong turn onto a local military base left his “little buddy” in a big bind and Randall with a whole different perspective.

A lifelong Nebraskan, U.S. Navy vet and dad, Randall had developed a father-son-like relationship with Jazon Gonzalez Perez, a Guatemalan migrant who managed a couple of local restaurants in the Plattsmouth area where Randall lives. He described Gonzalez Perez as an inquisitive, eager-to-learn hard worker.
The mentorship had grown to the point that Gonzalez Perez called Randall on June 7 when he — while looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work — wound up in a snag with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A cell phone search had led Gonzalez Perez toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base, where he was stopped and detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.
Gonzalez Perez called Randall, who told the Nebraska Examiner he was blindsided by seeing immigration agents take away his buddy. He said conversations with on-site local law enforcement officers led him to believe Gonzalez Perez would be allowed to leave if Randall drove the car.
Randall said it looked as though the plain-clothed ICE agents were called into duty unexpectedly. One brought a child with him as if the two had been on a family outing.
“I said, ‘Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. He’s a good kid. He just made a wrong turn,’” Randall said, recounting the episode. “I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists.
“He’s none of those.”

Expected ‘God-fearing’ workers last

Gonzalez Perez now sits in ICE custody at an Iowa jail, awaiting possible deportation for being in the country without proper authorization. And Randall says he is fuming over tactics he said turned out not to be what he voted for last November.
He expected “God-fearing” workers to be last in line. For the Plattsmouth-area resident who considers himself an independent swing voter, a different reality has “hit home” and shifted his mindset on federal immigration enforcement.

“Call me naive, but my clear understanding was we were going to go after the bad actors, not hardworking immigrants,” said Randall.
His frustration intensified in the days after the Offutt turn, as ICE and Homeland Security Investigations on June 10 detained nearly 80 workers from a worksite raid at an Omaha food plant. Not since a 2018 immigration operation in and around O’Neill, which ensnared 133 workers, had Nebraska seen such a large-scale enforcement action.
ICE officials said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was prompted by a federal criminal search warrant suspecting widespread use of stolen identifications by workers there to gain the jobs. So far, available federal court records show three of the workers that were detained have been charged criminally as a result of the operation, including one for stolen ID, though an ICE spokeswoman said Thursday the probe continues.

Raids were conducted days prior to Omaha’s in places such as a Home Depot and in a garment district in Los Angeles, sparking protests that then spilled across the country. Trump’s call for the Marines and California National Guard troops without the consent of that state’s governor escalated tensions.
Polling shows Randall is not alone in his frustration, as people witness the reality of stepped-up immigration enforcement at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration.
A CBS News survey conducted June 4-6 — prior to widespread protests of ICE arrests in Los Angeles — found 54% of people approved of Trump’s approach to deportations.
A more recent Quinnipiac University poll, released June 26, indicated 41% of voters  approved of the way Trump is handling immigration issues, compared to 46% who approved three months earlier in the university’s poll from March.
Approval from independent voters on the immigration question dropped to 32% from 41% in March.

Trump himself has delivered conflicting signals, reportedly ordering officials on June 12 to tap the brakes on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants. Days later, his social media post called for federal officials to “do all in their power” to deliver the “single largest mass deportation” program in history. His major targets: the Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
Flip flop
The flip-flopping concerns leaders at the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant & Refugee Advancement, saying it “further erodes trust for immigrant communities.”
CIRA, which provides legal services statewide, said any claim that enforcement is focused on “dangerous” individuals does not align with what its lawyers are seeing on the ground. It said mothers and fathers, including some who had been in the U.S. for decades, are being “ripped” from their families.
“This is not a public safety initiative — it’s political theater and our communities are paying the price,” the statement said.
According to TRAC, a widely-used national clearinghouse that tracks immigration and detention trends, ICE as of mid-June reported detaining 56,397 people  — up from 38,525 a year ago and a record high since 2019 when the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse began publishing semi-monthly statistics.
TRAC said nearly 72% of the detainees had no previous criminal conviction. Of the 28% who did, TRAC said many had been convicted of offenses such as minor traffic violations.

Longtime Omaha immigration attorney Rachel Yamamoto said she has noticed a pivot by federal officials to go after “easy pickings, low-hanging fruit,” apparently to meet the reported quotas of up to 3,000 arrests daily demanded by the Trump administration.
She pointed out her own clients: a mother-daughter duo detained June 4 at an appointment that in years past was a routine “check in.”
Maria De Leon of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, had entered the U.S. in 2014, with 3-year-old daughter Hermelinda in tow. She was released at the border to await a “credible fear” interview with federal officials that came six years later.
Her plea to stay was denied, and she was under an Order of Supervision to check in annually with immigration officials, Yamamoto said. Federal officials did not violate any rules in detaining De Leon, the attorney noted, as the food plant worker had an outstanding order of removal. But she called it “a drastic change from usual procedures.”
“She’s been on this order of supervision since 2014,” Yamamoto said of De Leon. “Everything was fine every year, until now. She’s never been arrested. She’s had a work permit. Her husband is working legally.”
Yamamoto and De Leon’s husband, who was waiting in another room, were particularly taken aback that Hermelinda, 14, also was detained. Yamamoto was with the mom and daughter when agents asked the teen to empty her pockets. She pulled out her phone and a lip gloss.
“That moment was horrible,” Yamamoto said. “Her eyes got big, like, ‘Am I being detained right now?’ I’m glad they didn’t cuff them.”
In past experience, Yamamoto said, youths typically were allowed to stay with the other parent. De Leon’s husband, Abel, had arrived in the U.S. two years prior to his wife and daughter, fleeing gangs, and has had an active asylum application pending for more than a decade in a backlogged court system. The couple’s 10-year-old son, born in the U.S., remains with dad in their South Omaha home.
De Leon’s family received word a few days later that mother and daughter were together in a family ICE facility in Texas. Yamamoto said the mom likely has no chance to stay in the U.S., though Hermelinda appears eligible for an asylum interview.

Businessman’s view
 

Immigration arrests have increased nationwide and more than doubled in 38 states since Trump took office Jan. 20, the New York Times reported Friday.
Nebraska has averaged 4.3 daily arrests — a 343% rise from 2024, the newspaper reported, based on data obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Deportation Data Project at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.
The data covers administrative arrests (those in which ICE seeks to deport rather than criminally prosecute the arrestee) conducted by the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division through June 10. It does not include criminal arrests, arrests made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations divisions or Customs and Border Protection.
From a small businessman’s perspective, Gary Jenkins of Omaha said he was confused and in unfamiliar territory when a Guatemalan crew member was apprehended by ICE agents who followed him and his brother on a recent Saturday work morning into a gas station.

Jenkins said he jumped into action to find legal help for the man he said reported loyally to housing renovation job sites for years. He described the man, in his early 40s, as a father of three. His understanding is that the worker had missed an immigration court date in New York while living in Omaha.
Soon after his detention, the man was returned to his homeland. His wife and kids remain in the Omaha area, as does a brother, who Jenkins says has legal status.
“These guys are over here doing great work,” he said. “Now I have to go out and find somebody I can trust and believe in.”
Federal officials paint a different picture. Mark Zito, special agent in charge of a Homeland Security Investigations office that covers Omaha, recently took aim at people supporting workers detained at Glenn Valley — pointing out havoc that can occur if an undocumented worker uses a stolen Social Security number to gain employment.
Federal officials have said that 100 “real victims” face financial and emotional consequences as a result of their identities being used fraudulently at Glenn Valley.










These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans.


– Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations office in Omaha


“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” Zito said in a statement. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives, isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
ICE offered a handful of examples, including: a Texan struggling to get Social Security disability payments as their ID was being fraudulently used to earn wages at Glenn Valley; a Coloradoan asked to repay $5,000 after their income was falsely increased due to wages earned at Glenn Valley, and a nursing student from Missouri losing out on college financial assistance because fraudulent use of ID pushed up income.

Gov. Pillen calls hard workers ‘A-OK’

Longtime South Omahan Sharon Boll sees the complexities, and sides with Trump policies.
She recently sat in a lawn chair watching an anti-ICE rally unfold in her neighborhood. She expressed empathy for families separated by deportations and trying to fix their residency status and respected the right to protest.
“I know the long citizenship path is a pain in the butt, but they need to be here legally,” said Boll, who had a large framed image of Jesus Christ propped on a chair next to her.  “A lot less harm will come to them.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, — quick to say he is “a 100% supporter of ICE” — has revealed a nuanced opinion of immigration enforcement, depending on the situation.

He said he has been to the border: “I’ve seen criminals and terrorists and kids being loaded like pack mules full of fentanyl and synthetic methamphetamines coming from China. Safety is the highest calling of government, that we get the criminals and terrorists out of here. That’s the focus and what I believe in.”
Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner he was “not talking about” established immigrant families, though, and urged Congress to “fix the immigration issue.”
“Anybody that is here working hard and being a good neighbor, they’re A-OK. They’re fine,” Pillen said.
He said he did see a problem at the Glenn Valley operation because of “concentration of folks doing criminal activity of stealing people’s ID — that’s a grave offense.”

Stopped at Offutt gate

Randall said he had been supportive of Trump’s crackdown when he understood the target to be high-level criminals.
Admittedly, he said he does not know all the intricacies of immigration law and what it takes for a foreign-born worker to enter or remain in the country with U.S. permission. He said he is familiar, however, with the manager at one of his go-to diners that he came to know as a sort of “adopted son.”
Over time, he learned that Gonzalez Perez had left his homeland to try and make a better living and help his siblings. His dad is a farmer in Guatemala, and his mom is deceased.
On a recent Saturday, Gonzalez Perez set out to make a bank deposit for his employer. The regular bank site was closed at the time. His boss told him it could wait, but Gonzalez Perez said he wanted to make sure payroll could be met, said Randall.
The online search led Gonzalez Perez to a satellite branch on the Offutt base property. A statement from Offutt’s public affairs chief said the man was detained at the gate, after presenting a Guatemalan ID card rather than a valid driver’s license.

Per security protocol, 55th Wing Security Forces contacted the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office and ICE “due to the individual operating a vehicle without a valid license and presenting a foreign identification card with no documentation authorizing access to the installation,” said Kris “Krispy” Pierce, who heads public affairs for the 55th Wing and Offutt.
“The safety and security of our installation and personnel remain our highest priority,” said Pierce.
Randall, called by Gonzalez Perez, said he first spoke by phone to an onsite sheriff’s deputy and, based on conversations, believed he would be able to drive his friend off base. Upon arriving, he found Gonzalez Perez sitting in his car blocked by cones.
Immigration agents later arrived, ran information through a device and put his friend in handcuffs, respectfully and without incident, Randall said. Gonzalez Perez is in ICE custody at the Pottawattamie County Jail.

‘Tipping point’

Gonzalez Perez has an immigration court hearing scheduled in early July.
His attorney said she prefers not to comment on the case.
Randall said he is monitoring closely. He believes deportation and immigration policy could be a political “tipping point” for independent voters like himself.
“I’m all for arresting bad actors. I think we all are,” Randall said. “That’s not what happened here.”

University of Missouri Health Care has not been part of the Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield network since April 1, making services at one of central Missouri’s dominant providers more expensive for about 90,000 people.
Throughout negotiations, MU Health Care CEO Ric Ransom told the Senate Insurance and Banking Committee, the two entities couldn’t find any common ground.
The deadlock continues despite an offer presented during the hearing by an administrator with Anthem’s parent company Elevance Health.
Rich Novack, Elevance’s president of commercial markets, said the company will give annual increases at 1% over the Consumer Price Index, or 3.3% for this year. MU Health’s latest offer asked for a 9% increase.
“That’s offer No. 1, right here, right now,” Novack said. “We could end this any second.”
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, characterized the presentation “like a TV show.”
The hearing was less like an episode of Let’s Make a Deal and more closely resembled Dr. Phil, with an airing of grievances between MU Health Care, Anthem and their customers.
The committee, which normally does not hold hearings on insurance provider disputes, called the two parties together to get a status update on negotiations and try to nudge them toward agreement.
“Our purpose here is to get these two entities there to make a decision to protect the 90,000 people that are not protected right now,” the committee’s chair Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, said at the start of the hearing.
Missouri Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, called for the hearing two weeks ago, saying in a Facebook post she hopes to “get the facts.”
“I am strongly encouraging both MU and Anthem to get this figured out prior to that hearing,” she wrote.
Ransom said that MU Health Care has offered a compromise during a year of negotiations, but Anthem has not budged.
“To this date, the total economic value of every proposal that we received from Anthem over the last year has been the same. So in the most literal ways, we are at this hearing today because Anthem never negotiated,” he said.
Anthem disagrees.
“We believe that we have countered multiple times,” Novack said.
During negotiations, both MU Health Care and Elevance have reported increased revenue, but both told committee members that there are growing expenses to contend with.
Elevance, a for-profit company, reported increased revenue in the first quarter of 2025 with an operating gain of $3.2 billion. During the quarter, the company repurchased nearly $880 million in stocks as part of a long-term buyback plan.
The University of Missouri reported during its Board of Curators meeting last week that MU Health had a $53.5 million operating gain during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2025, beating projections by $19.9 million.
Greg Damron, MU Health Care’s chief financial officer, told the board that gains are “ahead of where we planned to be, but where we planned to be is not at a sufficient level for our long-term sustainability.”
The figures do not include May and June, in which Anthem and MU Health were out of contract.
Damron said May came in under projection. And there has been “lower volumes” in June, “some of that due to Anthem.”
Ransom told the committee that operating margins have been thinning since 2019.
“We’ve been able to maintain a positive operating margin throughout this year, and I expect we’ll be able to end the year in the black,” he said. “But (the disagreement) is having an impact on MU Health Care.”

The dispute is also hurting the state’s employees. The Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan uses Anthem and is one year into a five-year contract that is renewable annually.
John Wiemann, who began as executive director of the state’s care plan in May, said there isn’t enough time to make changes to the carrier.
“We have been looking at other options, but none of those options are ones that we can do and implement right away with an Oct. 1 deadline,” he said.
Some of the 90,000 MU Health Care patients with Anthem health insurance testified about the ensuing hardship. Many had concerns that they were not able to access continuity of care programs.
Novack said MU Health Care denied offers for continuity of care. Ransom said MU had issues with a “difficult and confusing” continuity of care plan dictated by Anthem.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Thousands of nurses at dozens of health care facilities in the Twin Cities and Duluth area voted to authorize a strike last week if their union negotiators couldn’t reach a deal with their employers.
After getting permission from their members, union leaders for several hospitals and clinics moved quickly to initiate a strike.
The first wave of nurses and other health care workers — all in Duluth and Superior — intend to strike beginning July 8. They include hospital acute care nurses at Essentia Health’s hospitals in the area, and those at Aspirus Health’s St. Luke’s Hospital. It also includes nurses and other health care workers at Essentia Health clinics in Duluth and Superior, Miller Hill Ambulatory Surgery Center and Solvay Hospice House.
A second strike is set to begin July 10 at Essentia Health facilities in northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin. A group of unionized nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives and clinical nurse specialists — referred to collectively as “advanced practice providers” — will be the first with that title in Minnesota history to participate in a so-called “unfair labor practice” or ULP strike
ULP strikes are related to an employers’ violation of labor laws — rather than better pay or hours — and provide stronger job protections than other kinds of strikes. 
Sara McCumber, who has worked for Essentia Health as a nurse practitioner for 24 years and is part of her union’s negotiating unit, said Essentia has refused to come to the table to negotiate.
Essentia Health has contested the union election via the National Labor Relations Board, but a ruling in January shot down Essentia’s most recent appeal.
Nurses with the Minnesota Nurses Association say their top priority isn’t pay — it’s staffing. Nurses say they want higher nurse-to-patient ratios to ensure better care, lower burnout and less violence against health care workers, who  are five times more likely to be seriously injured from an assault on the job than the U.S. workforce as a whole, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7005-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

Game and Fish commissioners face influential, reluctant parties in quest to designate Wyoming’s first migration corridor since the state revamped its policy six years ago. 
The post Protecting the ‘Path of the Pronghorn’ draws support, but must again overcome industry resistance appeared first on WyoFile .","When it comes to designating Wyoming’s first migration corridor in over six years, retired sage grouse biologist Tom Christiansen puts it bluntly. 
“If not now, when?” Christiansen wrote in a comment letter to his former employer, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “If we fail to designate the Sublette Antelope Corridor, what is the point of the Executive Order?”
Precipitated by industry concerns, Gov. Mark Gordon’s 2019 executive order took the power to designate migration corridors out of Game and Fish’s hands, and instead created the more labyrinthine process playing out now.  
There are reasons for the slowed pace, agency officials have explained, but the governor’s migration policy has proven controversial and drawn questions about whether it functions to protect the threatened passageways relied upon by Wyoming wildlife. 
Christiansen’s support for the formal designation of what’s perhaps the Lower 48’s most-famous migration path is shared by the large majority of people and organizations who submitted a recent round of comments to the state. WyoFile reviewed the hundreds of comments obtained through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. The feedback came in response to Game and Fish’s recently completed 140-page “biological risk and opportunity assessment” for Sublette antelope — and it precedes a critical vote.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission had been scheduled to consider designating the Sublette Antelope Migration Corridor at their July meeting in Casper, but the agenda item was recently removed and is being bumped to the September meeting in Lander, according to Game and Fish Deputy Chief of Wildlife Martin Hicks. 
A bulk of the comments show that Wyoming residents want state decision-makers to press ahead with protecting the Sublette Antelope Migration Corridor. The area encompasses a webbed, 165-mile-long network of corridors, stopover sites and bottlenecks that trace across western Wyoming from Interstate 80 all the way north to Grand Teton National Park. 
When asked, “Do you believe that the Commission should recommend designation of this corridor to the Governor?” all but two of the hundreds of people who responded via the state’s comment submission portal answered yes. Additional letters sent in also leaned heavily in the direction of wanting the state to proceed with its slowed, but not stopped pursuit of designation.

Pinedale resident Carmel Kail illustrated the “urgency of the designation” by pointing to an oil and gas lease on state land within a bottleneck where the Sublette Pronghorn Herd crosses the New Fork River. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department recommended stipulations to protect the undesignated corridor there, but its guidance was ignored. 
“In sum, you cannot designate soon enough,” Kail wrote in her letter.
Linda Baker, who directs the Upper Green River Alliance, also jotted down an impassioned plea. 
“Our pronghorn have been celebrated in the pages of Smithsonian, National Geographic and by David Attenborough himself,” the Sublette County conservationist wrote. “Millions have been invested in easements and overpasses.”
“But promises, money and words alone will not maintain this pronghorn herd,” Baker added. “The best science in the world will not guarantee our pronghorns’ future. Only action at this critical time can do that.”
Designation — a final step of a meandering process affording some protections on public land — still faces several hurdles.

Not all parties, for one, are on board with a policy move that would recognize a corridor spanning 2.6 million acres. Notably, rigid protections are only provided in geographic pinchpoints called bottlenecks, which account for roughly 27,000 acres. And only about half that area is covered because the other half is exempted private land. 
The Petroleum Association of Wyoming repeated its reservations about proceeding with the plans and asked Game and Fish to first study the oil and gas industry’s “benefits” to large ungulates. Pete Obermueller, the trade group’s president, cited research that has found some insect species capitalize on native, flowering vegetation planted on rehabilitated wellpads and alleged that the sites have “become rich feeding grounds for migrating ungulates.” 
“We continue to believe that there is insufficient data to indicate an officially designated corridor is warranted,” Obermueller wrote. 
The proposed Sublette Antelope Corridor overlaps with several large natural gas fields: the Anticline, Jonah and Normally Pressured Lance fields. Decades of monitoring GPS-collared pronghorn on the Anticline concluded that the native tawny-and-white residents are avoiding, and even abandoning, the drilled-out landscape.

Concern from the Petroleum Association of Wyoming and a handful of other industry groups halted Game and Fish’s first bid to designate the Sublette migration corridor before the governor’s executive order took the decision out of the department’s hands. 
Six years later, some of those industry groups have changed their tune and gone on record stating support for the designation — at least in part. 
“We support the consideration of the designation of the primary Sublette Corridor as identified in the assessment as the North Segment, Bondurant Segment, Foothills Segment, East of WY-191 and Central Segment,” Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna wrote in his comment letter. 
But cattlemen were less on board with designating the more peripheral reaches of the Sublette Pronghorn corridor. 
Designation of the “Calpet, Fontenelle, and Southwest Segments” should be considered separately, Magagna wrote, and the “East of Farson and Red Desert Segments” ought to be removed from “designation consideration at this time.” 
Even if the Game and Fish Commission agrees to designate the corridor, more layers remain.
Gordon would then have a say, and if the governor’s on board, he’d appoint an “area working group” consisting of county commissioners, hunting advocates, industry reps and others to review the corridor. That group would then make another recommendation, before the decision would swing one more time back to Gordon or a future governor.

(File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State election officials have levied a fine of $700 against Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman, who subsequently closed his campaign account, clearing the way for him to take over as chair of the Maryland Democratic Party.
The campaign account could not be closed until Pittman cleared up discrepancies in his books, but as long as he had an account open, he could not fully assume the duties of party leadership that he won by acclamation almost 10 days ago at a party meeting.
Pittman’s campaign underreported $2,799.00 in contributions and $4,205.74 in expenditures, according to a June 26 letter from Allen Norfleet, director of candidacy and campaign finance for the Maryland State Board of Elections.
As a result, Norfleet imposed a civil penalty of $150 for each of the two infractions. Officials also imposed an additional $400 in penalties on the campaign: $200 each for failing to maintain both proper contribution and expenditure records.
By law, the civil penalty must come from the campaign account. If there is not enough money in the account, the chair and treasurer of the campaign committee are jointly responsible.
A spokesperson for the state party did not respond to a request for comment.
Norfleet confirmed that the account paid the fine the same day the fines were issued. The account was then closed, he said.
The remaining balance of nearly $41,000 was transferred from Pittman’s account to the state party — a move allowed by law.
The closure of the account clears the way for Pittman to fully step into the role of chair of the Maryland Democratic Party after being elected on June 21.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) tapped Pittman in May to head the party after then-Chair Ken Ulman announced he would resign by mid-June.
Pittman, who is in his second term as county executive, cannot seek a third term. But the term-limited Democrat still maintained a campaign finance account.
State law bars candidates from having their own campaign account while also serving as an officer on another account. The law is meant to prevent candidates from sidestepping campaign finance laws and donation limits.
And even though Pittman was term limited, state elections officials, and later Pittman himself, confirmed the prohibition applied.
The discrepancies in Pittman’s account, between his reported bank balance and the amount of cash his campaign claimed to have on hand, had been present in each of the Pittman campaign’s last two filings.
In an interview with Maryland Matters, Pittman vowed to “not even be quoted as party chair” until the issue was resolved.
Charlene Dukes, first vice chair of the party, has served as acting chair since Ulman’s resignation was official on June 13. The move allowed the party to continue raising and spending money.
Pittman is expected to step into that role once he assumes the chair position. As of Monday, Dukes was still listed as the chair of the party’s state campaign account, according to online records.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSC_0069-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker was living in Maryland when he was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop, as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Administration intends to deport Abrego Garcia to third country, DOJ lawyer says

Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial,” they said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators diverted $45 million from national opioid settlement funds to four hospitals in the $58.8 billion state budget they approved Monday — a last-minute surprise that drove harm-reduction advocates to protest in the Statehouse and the state attorney general to object in unusual public criticism of state lawmakers.
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), who chairs the Senate’s budget committee, said the diversion is meant to make up for losses the hospitals are expected to experience from federal Medicaid cuts.
“The thought process here is … to get some of the monies to some of the larger hospital systems for their harm reduction community-based programs, because they’re going to take a hit,” Sarlo said. “These hospitals are going to be on the front line of these Medicaid cuts.”
But Attorney General Matt Platkin said the hospitals will receive the money for uses not yet identified, despite a new five-year strategic plan a state advisory council released two weeks ago that requires beneficiaries to spend settlement funds on evidence-based solutions that help people recover from addiction.
The new appropriation, which he said he learned of Sunday night, “ignores” that plan, he added.
“These settlement funds are not general revenues for the State. They are the result of some of the most significant lawsuits ever filed by Attorneys General across this country to force companies to pay back the blood money that they stole in fueling the opioid epidemic,” Platkin said in a statement. “Spending this money in this way is a slap in the face to every family who lost a loved one in this devastating crisis, which continues to claim the lives of thousands of New Jerseyans each year.”
He warned lawmakers about “repeating the mistakes made with the state’s tobacco settlement funds, which should have been used exclusively to address damage caused by cigarettes.”
Harm reduction advocates echoed his concerns, accusing lawmakers of a “blatant misuse” of settlement funds in weekend deals brokered in secrecy.
Dozens lined a Statehouse hallway to implore passing legislators to vote against the allocation, as they waved tombstone-shaped signs with slogans including “Stealing sux! Fund harm redux!” and “Here lie legislators’ consciences.” They staged a die-in, partially blocking passers-by until state troopers intervened to move them along, and later, several were kicked out of the building after they unfurled a sign and began shouting during the Senate’s session.

Jenna Mellor heads the New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition and was a member of the advisory council, which spent 15 months hearing testimony from hundreds of people to devise its strategic plan.
“This was not in our recommendations,” Mellor said. “We gave very intentional recommendations for five areas that will save lives — harm reduction expansion, medicine for opioid use disorder, housing, wraparound services, and legal services. We will not be able to fund those things, if the hospitals keep getting this money.”
New Jersey will receive $1.1 billion in settlement funds through 2038, with half going to the state and the other half directly to county and local governments.
The $45 million going to hospitals in the coming budget year represents 10% of the state’s total share, as well as the single-biggest settlement fund expenditure in the fiscal year that begins Tuesday, advocates said. 
Racquel Romans-Henry, policy director of Salvation and Social Justice, joined advocates’ protest at the Statehouse.
“Historically in this state, hospitals have, for better or worse, been the source of a lot of the racial disparities that exist around health care,” Romans-Henry said. “Giving them this kind of money — when they neither need it and when so many grassroots organizations are reeling from federal cuts and are doing the work on the ground — is really a misalignment of the funds and the intent of the funds.”
Platkin urged legislators to reject the appropriation, but also vowed: “If they do not, my office will be carefully scrutinizing these hospital systems to make sure every single dollar is spent within the terms of the settlements we fought for years to obtain.”










Spending this money in this way is a slap in the face to every family who lost a loved one in this devastating crisis.


– Attorney General Matt Platkin


Four hospitals will receive the funds, advocates said. RWJBarnabas Health and Cooper University Hospital will get $15 million each, Hackensack University Medical Center will get $10 million, and Atlantic Health System will receive $5 million.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy did not respond to a request for comment, but Sarlo said Murphy had signed off on the allocation.
Murphy’s former chief of staff, George Helmy, is an executive vice president at RWJ Barnabas and chief of its external affairs and policy office, while Cooper University Health Care is run by South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, another Murphy ally.
Bre Azanedo said grassroots organizations like Black Lives Matter-Paterson, where she serves as a program manager, are more trusted, effective harm reduction providers than hospitals. She also raised concerns about accountability.
“If they’re going to add ‘no deliverables, no strings attached,’ then that should also apply to us, as organizations,” Azanedo said. “They make us jump through hoops of fire for $20.”
Tonia Ahern, community coordinator for the National Center for Advocacy and Recovery, warned that “funding enormous health systems” won’t solve the overdose crisis.
“We hear horror stories all the time about people being mistreated and discriminated against at the hospital with no accountability,” Ahern said. “And what happens to people once they leave with no support, or access to medications and individualized care? It’s going to fall on harm reduction and recovery organizations to pick up the pieces, and now with less funding.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 



The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request. 
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.
Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling. 
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.
$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Legislature approved a $115.1 billion budget after a 105-day extended session, which is half-a-billion less than what the governor recommended before the session. However, during the budget signing ceremony and in ensuing press releases, the governor padded the size of the Legislature’s budget to include spending that does not all count toward the new fiscal year. 
DeSantis insisted that after his $567 million in budget vetoes, the total budget was $10 million more than his recommendation.
The 2025-2026 budget comes in less than the 2024-2025 budget, which was $117.46 billion.
“How many places are spending less year over year? Not a lot,” DeSantis said Monday morning when signing the budget in Wildwood.
DeSantis also canceled $750 million meant to bolster a reserve fund. Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez touted the plan to add the money in case of a recession. The fund will reach nearly $5 billion in the new budget. 
DeSantis explained that he didn’t think voters would like the idea of increasing the reserves; they can raise it themselves in November 2026 via a proposed constitutional amendment to raise the legal ceiling on the fund.
Albritton’s spokesperson declined to comment, and Perez’s office didn’t immediately respond to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment on the veto of the large-ticket item the Legislature had emphasized.
“None of us know what the future holds,” Perez told reporters during budget negotiations in early June. “I think this is just a preparation of being prepared for the unexpected, and none of us know what the unexpected is, but we have a sample to look at in the 2000s when we had a recession.

Bye, bye business rent tax
Florida is the only state to assess a business rent tax. No longer is that the case, starting Tuesday.
“The Legislature has also done something that I’ve been asking for many years, and that’s eliminating a tax that only Florida has of all 50 states, and that’s taxing business rents. It’s not good for our economy. It’s not good for business growth. And so that tax is being sunsetted.” DeSantis said. 
In all, the plan is estimated to provide $1.3 billion in tax relief. 
Lawmakers passed a budget that eliminated 1,745 positions, or 1.5% of the authorized workforce. 
Among the budget vetoes is $14 million for Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office hangar, $4.4 million for public television stations, $1.3 million for public radio stations, $1.5 million for Broward County eviction prevention and rental assistance program, and $2.8 million for a Florida International University transportation efficiency program.
DeSantis vetoed the nearly $360,000 lawmakers set aside to conduct a pilot program on a bell-to-bell ban on cellphone use in six Florida school districts. 
The College of the Florida Keys Marine and Maritime Professional Institute was vetoed, a total of $1.99 million. 
OnBikes Pensacola was allocated $62,500 in the budget, but DeSantis vetoed that line item. One of OnBikes’ vice presidents is Rep. Alex Andrade, chair of the committee that probed Hope Florida, First Lady Casey DeSantis’ charity. 
Lawmakers had agreed to provide $750,000 for the construction of the Florida Museum of Black History in St. Augustine, but DeSantis vetoed its funding. 
Property taxes 
DeSantis vetoed $1 million to study the consequences of eliminating property taxes.
“We don’t need to give a bureaucracy money to study this. We know what needs to be done, so let’s just do it, and we will do it,” DeSantis said. 
“Property tax is going to require us to go to the ballot and get it done,” DeSantis said. “I know I spoke with President Albritton yesterday about it. He’s committed to do it. There’s no excuses. In the House of Representatives, we have almost a three-to-one Republican majority. Is there any possible excuse for why you can’t get it done?”
Vacancies
With former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez’s departure earlier this year, the lieutenant governor position remains vacant, as does the chief financial officer after now-U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis resigned to run for his new position. 
The governor said he has not made decisions on those positions but would in “relatively short order,” but not before the July 4 holiday weekend.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the June 23 through June 29 reporting period was the “wettest” of the season, with precipitation totals 2-4 inches above normal in some areas. 
While the rain hindered some field work, it was overall beneficial for Iowa crops which continue to rate highly according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said corn tassels are beginning to show, “signaling crop development remains on track.”

According to the report, around 3% of Iowa corn was beginning to silk and the crop rated 85% good or excellent. Soybeans were also a couple of days ahead of average, with 22% of the crop blooming across the state. Soybeans rated 77% good to excellent. 
“Last week brought multiple rounds of rain to much of the state, marking the wettest seven days of the growing season thus far,” Naig said. “In addition to benefitting the corn and soybeans, the moisture helps to replenish our streams, pastures and hay fields.” 
As a whole, the state averaged 2.81 inches for the reporting period, which was more than an inch and a half above normal. Precipitation maps show central and western parts of the state received the most rainfall during the period.

The rain pushed some areas, most severely north central and central Iowa, to hold excess soil moisture. Around 40% of topsoil moisture rated surplus in these regions and in north central Iowa, nearly 50% of subsoil had surplus moisture. 
The state average topsoil moisture condition rated 65% adequate and 21% surplus. Subsoil conditions on average were 70% adequate and 27% short. 
The first cutting of alfalfa hay all but wrapped up during the reporting period, with 97% completed across the state and 30% of the second cutting of hay complete. 
Oats also progressed, with 90% headed and 39% coloring. Iowa’s oat crop rated 83% good or excellent. 
In addition to heavy rainfall, it was also a hot week across the state. The statewide average high temperature for the week, at 92 degrees Fahrenheit, was 10 degrees above the normal. 
Forecasts for the coming week show Iowans can expect an inch or two of rain and slightly above average temperatures, which Naig said will be “pleasant conditions for a festive and fun Independence Day weekend filled with fireworks, cookouts and outdoor celebrations.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return. 
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country. 
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation. 
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release. 
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation. 
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request. 
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

Outgoing Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced the reopening of Thalia Mara Hall during his final press conference held Monday on the arts venue’s steps. 
“Today marks what we view as a full circle moment, rejoicing in the iconic space where community has come together for decades in the city of Jackson,” Lumumba said. “Thalia Mara has always been more than a venue. It has been a gathering place for people in the city of Jackson. From its first class ballet performances to gospel concerts, Thalia Mara Hall has been the backdrop for our city’s rich cultural history.” 
Thalia Mara Hall closed last August after mold was found in parts of the building. The issues compounded from there, with malfunctioning HVAC systems and asbestos remediation. On June 6, the Mississippi State Fire Marshal’s Office announced that Thalia Mara Hall had finally passed inspection. 
“We’re not only excited to have overcome many of the challenges that led to it being shuttered for a period of time,” Lumumba said. “We are hopeful for the future of this auditorium, that it may be able to provide a more up-to-date experience for residents, inviting shows that people are able to see across the world, bringing them here to Jackson. So this is an investment in the future.”
In total, Emad Al-Turk, a city contracted engineer and owner of Al-Turk Planning, estimates that $5 million in city and state funds went into bringing Thalia Mara Hall up to code. 
The venue still has work to be completed, including reinstalling the fire curtain. The beam in which the fire curtain will be anchored has asbestos in it, so it will have to be remediated. In addition, a second air-conditioning chiller needs to be installed to properly cool the building. Until it’s installed, which could take months, Thalia Mara Hall will be operating at a lower seating capacity of about 800. 
“Primarily because of the heat,” Al-Turk said. “The air conditioning would not be sufficient to actually accommodate the 2,000 people at full capacity, but starting in the fall, that should not be a problem.”
Al-Turk said the calendar is open for the city to begin booking events, though none have been scheduled for July. 
“We’re very proud,” he said. “This took a little bit longer than what we anticipated, but we had probably seven or eight different contractors we had to coordinate with and all of them did a superb job to get us where we are today.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/18221431/Thalia-Mara-Hall.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

(Screenshot)Update: This story was last updated at 11:45 p.m. Mountain time on June 29.
Two firefighters have been killed and another is injured after crews in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the Coeur d’Alene hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third is being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
The injured firefighter has been released from surgery, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a 9:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday press conference. Information about his injuries or their extent was not released.
“He is fighting for his life but is in stable condition,” the sheriff said.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said. The sheriff said he believes the two incidents are related.
“We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and that it was intentional,” Norris said. “We do believe he started it, and it was totally intentional, what he did.”
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.

However, the brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Sunday night post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
Fire crews were unable to access the fire until it was deemed safe at around 7:30 p.m., the Idaho Department of Lands said in a press release.
“Crews estimate the fire to be about 15-20 acres, with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the press release says. “Additional resources including aircraft, heavy equipment, water tenders, engines, hand crews and a Type 3 Incident Management Team are on order and anticipated to work the fire tomorrow.”
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, the Department of Lands said in the release.
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”
The sheriff urged the public to wait until official information is released by law enforcement to donate to funds to benefit the victims’ families. Scammers have been known to take advantage of tragedies like this and start GoFundMe fundraising campaigns without the consent of the families, he said.
 North Idaho shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
One of the firefighters killed was from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, while the other was from the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department. The injured firefighter served the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, Norris said.
“There is a belief that (the shooter) ran and shot, so we don’t know what (evidence) we might be collecting once the fire threat diminishes,” Norris said.
Norris said the suspect’s body was removed from the scene to preserve it due to the threat of the fire.
The sheriff held two press conferences on Sunday: one at 4:30 p.m. Pacific, and one at 9:30 p.m.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris initially said law enforcement was unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers, but at the evening press conference, he said the ongoing investigation was pointing to one shooter. At the afternoon conference, he said officers and deputies were reporting from the scene that the shooter was “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Authorities are unsure whether the shooter was killed by responding officers or if he killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Norris said. He said an autopsy of the suspect’s body is scheduled in Spokane and would offer more information on how he died.
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies — an estimated 300 law enforcement officers, some from as far away as Montana — responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

Kootenai County Commission chairman Bruce Mattare said the shooting was “senseless and tragic beyond words.”
“June 29, 2025, is a day that we will not forget in this community,” Mattare said at the evening press conference. “It is the day evil showed its face and we lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality, and I cannot fathom why anyone would commit such a heinous act.”
The commissioner said this kind of “senseless violence is unheard of here” and does not reflect Coeur d’Alene as a community.
“When you hear how others portray the people who live here on the news, it’s not true,” Mattare said. “What happened here decades ago is not reflective of the fine people who live here today. And I want everyone to know that this is a wonderful place to live, to raise your family and visit.”
He stressed that resources were being provided at the state and federal level to investigate the killings and fire.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Rep. Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Montana’s Republican senators over the weekend praised the removal of a provision to sell public lands from a federal budget reconciliation bill.
In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy called the move “a victory for our Montana way of life.”
“We look forward to the final passage of the Big Beautiful Bill in order to prevent the largest tax increase in American history, secure the border, unleash American energy, and most importantly, implement President Trump’s America First agenda that Montanans – and folks across the country – overwhelmingly support and sent us here to enact.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who has led the push to sell off federal land for development, announced on social media over the weekend that he would not move forward with his provision as part of the One Big Beautiful bill before it advanced in the Senate.  The move follows strong opposition from members of Montana’s Congressional delegation and other elected officials, especially from Western states, as well as myriad conservation and outdoors groups.
“I continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land — land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation,” Lee posted in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. He said that the budget reconciliation process did not let him secure “clear, enforceable safeguards” to ensure the land sales would go to families, rather than corporations or foreign interests.
Lee originally introduced a provision that sought to sell millions of acres of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address the affordable housing crisis, specifically near urban areas in the West, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled against including it in the budget bill. A subsequent, slimmed down proposal still faced opposition from members of Lee’s own party, notably congressmen from Montana and Idaho.
On Saturday, Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy posted on X that he opposed the sale of public land and would vote against proceeding with the bill if the provision was included.  Shortly after, he said he would vote to move the bill along, but would lead an amendment to strip the land sales out.
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously led the charge to remove a different land sale from an earlier version of the bill and decried Lee’s provision as a “poison pill,” released a statement on Sunday in response to Lee withdrawing his proposal.
“The SEALs taught me to Never Quit and to always rely on my teammates. Both were keys to our public lands victory. We always had backup plans, and we had the greatest coalition of support I’ve seen. Public lands are not red or blue, they are red, white and blue. They belong to all of us whether we’re from Massachusetts or Montana,” Zinke said. “I greatly appreciate the work of my colleagues in the House and Senate who were leaders either publicly or behind closed doors, particularly Senators Sheehy, Daines, Crapo, Risch, Chairman Simpson, and Speaker Johnson. And Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum who made it clear that mass land sales was not the Trump agenda. They are the Rough Riders.”
Several conservation and outdoor recreation groups released statements praising the actions taken to remove the land sale provision from the bill.
Chris Wood, president and CEO of the conservation organization Trout Unlimited said in a statement that protecting public lands is the “most nonpartisan issue in the country.
“Public lands are the cornerstone of our conservation legacy, uniting us with the last best places this country has to offer. We thank the members of Congress who have joined hundreds of thousands of outdoorsmen and women in opposing widespread public land selloffs in reconciliation. This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt, and explore,” Wood said.
On Monday, the Senate continued to slog through dozens of amendment votes on President Donald Trump’s priority policy proposal, which includes extending and expanding the Trump tax cuts enacted in 2017, adding restrictions to Medicaid, expanding investments in immigration and border policy, and making cuts to Biden-era climate change and student debt relief programs.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Fee hikes for hunting and fishing licenses, workplace protections for immigrants and increased requirements for gun dealers are among the Washington state laws going into effect July 1. 
Drivers can also expect increased prices at the pump as a 6-cent hike in Washington’s gas tax goes into effect Tuesday, the start of the state’s 2026 fiscal year.
Dozens more laws will take effect July 27, which marks 90 days after the legislative session adjourned. Others passed in Olympia this year have longer lead times.
For now, these bills have a few weeks’ head start.
License fees
Throughout the most recent legislative session, which ended in April, Republicans in Olympia repeatedly accused Democrats of “taxing the joy” out of Washington. 
Senate Bill 5583 is one reason why. The legislation raises fees for hunting and fishing licenses 38%. For example, the big game deer license will jump from $39 to $53.82. A combination freshwater and saltwater fishing license will increase from $45.50 to $62.79.
Prices for Washingtonians over 70 years old are discounted. 
The fee increases are expected to raise about $19.6 million in the next two years. A fiscal analysis assumed license sales would drop 11% due to the price hike. The proceeds go to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
The legislation passed on razor-thin margins, including a one-vote difference in the state Senate as some Democrats joined Republicans in opposition. Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it into law last month.
For many Washingtonians, fishing and hunting are “allowing young kids to go out with their grandma and grandpa, maybe kids that couldn’t afford to do other things,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “By increasing these fees, we are putting a barrier on people who are lower income.”
It’s one of a number of tax hikes Democrats pushed through to address a budget shortfall pegged between $12 billion and $16 billion over the next four years. 
“Inflation does continue to go up. These fees have not gone up. It is time to do that,” said Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, in floor debate in April. “We are in a budget crisis and we do need to tighten our belts and be responsible, and this is part of that.”
Lawmakers also raised the price of an annual Discover Pass to access state lands from $30 to $45. That change goes into effect Oct. 1.
Coercing immigrants
A new law going into effect Tuesday aims to protect workers from coercion by their employer based on immigration status.
Workplace coercion could be used to violate wage or agricultural labor laws. For example, if an employee’s boss mentions someone’s immigration status before asking them to work unpaid overtime.
Workers can now file complaints about such threats to the state Department of Labor and Industries, under Senate Bill 5104. Maximum civil penalties range from $1,000 for the first violation to $10,000 for a third. 
New Jersey passed similar legislation last year.
Gun sellers
The Legislature passed House Bill 2118 in 2024 to impose stricter requirements on gun dealers. 
Advocates said the legislation will help keep guns out of the wrong hands. Opponents argued the regulations would be costly to implement and force dealers out of business despite gun thefts from licensed sellers being rare.
Among the new requirements are increased security measures and 24-hour deadlines for responding to police requests to help track guns used in crimes and report lost or stolen firearms. Dealers’ video surveillance systems, for example, must film entrances and exits, anywhere firearms are displayed and where transactions occur. Some of the recordings must be kept for 90 days. 
All employees must be over 21 years old and undergo fingerprinting and background checks before selling any guns. And they have to get background checks each year after that.
Dealers with monthly sales under $1,000 are exempt from the new requirements.
The bill passed along party lines, with Democrats in support. This year, lawmakers considered going further in the state’s requirements for gun dealers, but that measure stalled.
Equal pay
Passed in 2024, House Hill 1905 updates Washington’s equal pay law to prohibit workplace discrimination based on membership in a protected class. This includes wage discrimination or discrimination in career advancement. The Equal Pay and Opportunities Act previously only focused on gender. 
Protected classes now covered include age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship status, military status or disability. 
Employers can still vary compensation based on education, experience, training, seniority or a merit system.
Violating the law can be punished by a misdemeanor. 
Crimes on tribal lands
A new state law aims to stop criminal suspects from fleeing Washington’s tribal lands to evade law enforcement. 
Senate Bill 6146 authorizes police to enforce warrants that the state’s federally recognized tribes issue, and bring fugitives back to reservations to face prosecution. 
Tribes have recognized state warrants since 1854, but that practice hasn’t been reciprocated. 
“The safety of all Washingtonians is a responsibility across governmental families, and SB 6146 responds to those victims of crimes, from drug dealers to domestic violence,” state Rep. Debra Lekanoff, D-Anacortes, said in a statement last year. Lekanoff is the only Native American woman serving in the state House.
Since passing with unanimous support in the Legislature last year, a task force has worked on how to implement the new law. Out of that work came legislation that lawmakers approved this year to make some changes to last year’s law.
Trafficking
Hundreds of children in Washington are victims of sex trafficking every year. 
Lawmakers unanimously passed Senate Bill 6006 last year to better identify these minors. The new law adds trafficking to the definition of abuse or neglect that mandatory reporters would have to report. And state agencies must use a validated assessment tool to screen children for commercial sexual abuse.
Victims can also now ask for a sexual assault protection order based on commercial sexual exploitation. Police can also file petitions on their behalf. Denials of these civil orders can’t be based on the person consenting to sex.
Under the law, the state Department of Children, Youth and Families must offer services to children identified as survivors of sex trafficking. 
The measure also removes the statute of limitations for some statutes used to prosecute traffickers.
“Currently, survivors of sex trafficking do not have the same rights and access to the services and support that survivors of childhood sexual assault do,” said the bill’s sponsor Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond. “These sexually exploited children are not criminals; they are victims. This bill continues to ensure we recognize that even though their abuse is paid for, they deserve the same access to services and support. That is justice.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1571-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

In honor of the late Congressman Pat Williams, Gov. Greg Gianforte ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at all State buildings on July 2 and 3, the family said in a news release.
A celebration of life for Williams will be held at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, July 15, in Missoula at the Dennison Theater at the University of Montana.
Williams, a Democrat from Butte, died of natural causes on June 25 at the age of 87.
Williams served 18 years in Congress, more consecutive terms in the U.S. House than anyone in Montana history.
His body will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Helena from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesday, July 2, and from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, July 3, his family said in the news release. He will then be transported to Butte for a private family burial.
The Williams family will host the celebration of life in Missoula on July 15 at the Dennison Theater. Doors will open at 3 p.m. for the 4 p.m. event, and a reception will take place at 5:30 p.m.
Following news of his death last week, Montanans praised Williams’ legacy of public service.
“Susan and I join Montanans in commemorating the life and legacy of former Montana Congressman Pat Williams,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in a statement. “As Montana’s longest-serving congressman, Pat championed Montana’s interests, working to find common ground for nearly 20 years in Washington. He was a dedicated public servant. We ask all Montanans to keep his wife Carol and their children in your prayers.”
Democratic Minority Leaders Sen. Pat Flowers of Belgrade and Rep. Katie Sullivan of Missoula said although Williams was known for his federal service, he began his political career “in the stomping grounds of the Montana State Legislature.”
“As current state legislators, and as minority leaders for House and Senate Democrats, we not only honor Pat’s legendary service at the federal level, but also his hard work in Montana’s Capitol, where he began his lifelong career of looking out for children and working families,” said Flowers and Sullivan in a joint statement. “His contributions to the state will not be forgotten, and we will continue to honor his memory.
“His family, and the state of Montana, should feel eternally grateful and proud that Pat brought his hard-working Butte, Montana, values all the way to Washington, D.C., and applied them to create better lives for all Americans.”
Memorials can be made to the Pat Williams Artists Scholarship at the University of Montana or The Williams Family Fund.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pat_butte-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 22:08:40+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Hurdles waiting in the shadows’: Lumumba reflects on challenges and triumphs on final day as Jackson mayor,Anna Wolfe and Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/lumumba-on-final-day-as-jackson-mayor/,Chokwe Antar Lumumba is ending his second term as mayor of Mississippi's capital city. He pledged to make Jackson the most radical city in America but spent most of his time dealing with emergencies.,"On his last day as mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba recounted accomplishments, praised his executive team and said he has no plans to seek office again.
He spoke during a press conference outside of the city’s Thalia Mara Hall, which was recently cleared for reopening after nearly a year of remediation. The briefing, meant to give media members a peek inside the downtown theater, marked one of Lumumba’s final forays as mayor.
Longtime state Sen. John Horhn — who defeated Lumumba in the Democratic primary runoff — will be inaugurated as mayor Tuesday, but Lumumba won’t be present. Not for any contentious reason, the 42-year-old mayor noted, but because he returns to his private law practice Tuesday.
“I’ve got to work now, y’all,” Lumumba said. “I’ve got a job.”
Thalia Mara Hall’s presumptive comeback was a fitting end for Lumumba, who pledged to make Jackson the most radical city in America but instead spent much of his eight years in office parrying one emergency after another. The auditorium was built in 1968 and closed nearly 11 months ago after workers found mold caused by a faulty HVAC system – on top of broken elevators, fire safety concerns and vandalism.
“This job is a fast-pitched sport,” Lumumba said. “There’s an abundance of challenges that have to be addressed, and it seems like the moment that you’ve gotten over one hurdle, there’s another one that is waiting in the shadows.” 
Outside the theater Monday, Lumumba reflected on the high points of his leadership instead of the many crises — some seemingly self-inflicted — he faced as mayor. 
He presided over the city during the coronavirus pandemic and the rise in crime it brought, but also the one-two punch of the 2021 and 2022 water crises, exacerbated by the city’s mismanagement of its water plants, and the 18-day pause in trash pickup spurred by Lumumba’s contentious negotiations with the city council in 2023. 
Then in 2024, Lumumba was indicted alongside other city and county officials in a sweeping federal corruption probe targeting the proposed development of a hotel across from the city’s convention center, a project that has remained stalled in a 20-year saga of failed bids and political consternation. 
Slated for trial next year, Lumumba has repeatedly maintained his innocence. 
The city’s youngest mayor also brought some victories to Jackson, particularly in his first year in office. In 2017, he ended a furlough of city employees and worked with then-Gov. Phil Bryant to avoid a state takeover of Jackson Public Schools. In 2019, the city successfully sued German engineering firm Siemens and its local contractors for $89 million over botched work installing the city’s water-sewer billing infrastructure.
“I think that that was a pivotal moment to say that this city is going to hold people responsible for the work that they do,” Lumumba said. 
Lumumba had more time than any other mayor to usher in the 1% sales tax, which residents approved in 2014 to fund infrastructure improvements.
“We paved 144 streets,” he said. “There are residents that still are waiting on their roads to be repaved. And you don’t really feel it until it’s your street that gets repaved, but that is a significant undertaking.”
And under his administration, crime has fallen dramatically recently, with homicides cut by a third and shootings cut in half in the last year.
Lumumba was first elected in 2017 after defeating Tony Yarber, a business-friendly mayor who faced his own scandals as mayor. A criminal justice attorney, Lumumba said he never planned to seek office until the stunning death of his father, Chokwe Lumumba Sr., eight months into his first term as mayor in 2014.
“I can say without reservation, and unequivocally, we remember where we started. We are in a much better position than we started,” Lumumba said. 
Lumumba said he has sat down with Horhn in recent months, answered questions “as extensively as I could,” and promised to remain reachable to the new mayor.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01231358/Lumumba-6.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

According to a Monday press release, Reynolds signed Executive Order 13 on June 27, which included orders for the Iowa Board of Regents to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, review policies at state universities and conduct another review next year of any policy changes and the response to any new acts of antisemitism.
The first review must be completed by November, the executive order stated, with a report due to Reynolds on Dec. 1. Follow-up reviews will operate on the same timeline.
“Since the October 7th attacks, we’ve seen an increase in antisemitism across the U.S., including on college campuses,” Reynolds said in the release. “While many of Iowa’s colleges and universities have condemned such activity, we want to be clear that antisemitism has no place in Iowa.”
Also included in the executive order is a directive for the Iowa Department of Education to provide educational materials and resources to public and nonpublic Iowa schools about Jewish history, the Holocaust and Israel.
Using data from the Anti-Defamation League’s 2024 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, the executive order states Iowa saw a 40% increase in antisemitic incidents between 2023 and 2024, and a 92% increase since 2020. Reynolds previously spoke about rising antisemitism when responding to pro-Palestine protests on Iowa college campuses.
“The State of Iowa reiterates its longstanding support for Israel and Iowa’s Jewish community, and continues to condemn any form of threat, harassment, intimidation, hate speech, or other action that endangers the Jewish community or violates state or federal law,” the executive order stated.

,DC,2025-06-30 22:06:41+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Rural hospitals, SNAP cuts, Medicaid: Democrats force tough votes on GOP mega-bill","Ashley Murray, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rural-hospitals-snap-cuts-medicaid-democrats-force-tough-votes-gop-mega-bill,,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans were closing in Monday on passing their version of the ""big beautiful"" tax break and spending cut bill that President Donald Trump wants to make law by a self-imposed July Fourth deadline.But the chamber's Democrats first kicked off a marathon of amendment votes, forcing their GOP colleagues to go on the record on tough issues, including cuts to health and food safety net programs. As of early evening, Democrats had not prevailed on any votes.The tactic is used by the opposition party during massive budget reconciliation fights to draw attention to specific issues even as their amendments are likely to fail.Democrats decried numerous measures in the mega-bill, including new work reporting requirements for Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people and people with disabilities.Loud opposition has also swelled as legislative proposals shift significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.""I say to our colleagues, ‘Vote for families over billionaires,’"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said on the Senate floor.The heart of the nearly 1,000-page legislation extends and expands the 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level and makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The bill would also put in motion some of Trump's campaign promises, including no tax on qualifying tips, overtime or car loan interest, but only for a few years.The tax cuts are estimated to cost nearly $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and a provision in the bill raises the nation’s borrowing limit to $5 trillion as the United States faces record levels of debt.Overall, the Senate bill is projected to add $3.25 trillion to deficits during the next decade, according to the latest calculation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Here are some key votes so far:Planned Parenthood Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray tried to remove language from the bill that would block Medicaid payments from going to Planned Parenthood for one year unless the organization stops performing abortions.Federal law already bars funding from going toward abortions, with limited exceptions, but GOP lawmakers have proposed blocking any other funding from going to the organization, effectively blocking Medicaid patients from going to Planned Parenthood for other types of health care.Murray said the proposal would have a detrimental impact on health care for lower-income women and called it a “long-sought goal of anti-choice extremists.”“Republicans' bill will cut millions of women off from birth control, cancer screenings, essential preventive health care — care that they will not be able to afford anywhere else,” Murray said. “And it will shutter some 200 health care clinics in our country.”Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith opposed efforts to remove the policy change and raised a budget point of order, which was not waived following a 49-51 vote. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski voted with Democrats.“There was a time when protecting American tax dollars from supporting the abortion industry was an uncontroversial, nonpartisan effort that we could all get behind,” Hyde-Smith said.Medicaid for undocumented immigrantsSenators from both political parties crossed the aisle over whether the federal government should reduce how much a state is given for its Medicaid program if that state uses its own taxpayer dollars to enroll immigrants living in the country without proper documentation.The provision was included in an earlier version of the bill, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled it didn’t comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill.The vote was 56-44, but since it was on waiving a budget point of order, at least 60 senators had to agree to set aside the rules and move forward with the amendment, so the vote failed.Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia voted with GOP senators. Maine’s Collins voted with most of the chamber’s Democrats against moving forward.Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn asked for the vote, saying he believes the policy change would reduce undocumented immigration.“Border patrol talks about push and pull factors,” Cornyn said. “One of the pull factors for illegal immigration is the knowledge that people will be able to receive various benefits once they make it into the country.”Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., opposed Cornyn’s attempt to get the language back in the bill, saying the policy change would financially harm states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law for simple mistakes.“What this amendment says is that if one person, despite state law, through a bureaucratic mistake, is receiving funds, then the whole state pays the price and has their rate on expanded Medicaid changed from 90% to 80%,” Merkley said, referring to the percentage paid by the federal government.Reduction in funding for Consumer Financial Protection BureauAn amendment to stop a nearly 50% reduction in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was blocked by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who championed the CFPB after the 2008 financial collapse, attempted to bring the amendment to the floor saying the agency “is the financial watchdog to keep people from getting cheated on credit cards and mortgages and Venmo and payday loans and a zillion other transactions.”""When this financial cop can't do its job there is no one else in the federal government to pick up the slack,"" Warren said.Scott blocked her using a budget point of order, saying the reduction still provides “ample funding” for the agency. Democrats tried to waive that procedural tactic, but failed following a 47-53 vote.An original provision to completely zero out the budget for the CFPB was not included because it did not meet the reconciliation process’ parameters.Medicaid hospitals and maternal mortalitySenators voted 48-52 to reject Delaware Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester’s proposals to send the legislation back to committee to remove language cutting certain funding for Medicaid, which she said would negatively impact “vital hospital services, especially labor and delivery rooms.”“Today, Medicaid is the single largest payer of maternity care in the United States, covering 40% of births nationwide and nearly half of the births in our rural communities,” Blunt Rochester said. “Obstetric units, particularly in rural hospitals, are closing at alarming rates, actually creating maternity deserts.”No Republicans spoke in opposition to the proposal, though Maine’s Collins voted in support. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance ProgramNew Mexico Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján offered a motion to commit the bill back to committee in order to remove all changes related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It was rejected following a 49-51 vote, though Alaska Republican Sens. Dan Sullivan and Murkowski voted in favor.“I’m offering my colleagues the opportunity to step away from these devastating cuts, to show our fellow Americans that in this country we care for our friends, family and neighbors who need support,” Luján said.Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., opposed the proposals, saying that SNAP is “on an unsustainable path wrought with mismanagement and waste.”“This program has devolved into viewing success as enrolling more individuals to be dependent on government assistance,” Boozman said. “SNAP is long overdue for change.”Medicaid work requirementsSenators voted 48-52 to reject a proposal from Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons that would have sent the bill back to committee to remove language requiring Medicaid enrollees to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month. Alaska’s Murkowski was the only member of her party to vote in favor of the effort.Democrats have expressed concern for weeks that some people would lose access to Medicaid if they forgot to complete paperwork proving that time commitment or didn’t understand how to show the government they met the new requirement.“It is cruel and dishonest to bury patients, kids and seniors in paperwork and then blame them when they lose their health care, all to further rig our tax code for the very wealthiest,” Coons said.Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall urged opposition to the proposal, saying that working helps people.“My question is, don’t you think a job brings value, that it brings dignity?” Marshall said. “Do you not think it brings purpose and meaning to life?”Rural hospitals and MedicaidMaine’s Collins and Alaska’s Murkowski both voted for a proposal from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey that would have removed parts of the bill changing Medicaid.But even with some bipartisan support, the changes were rejected on a 49-51 vote that would have technically sent the bill back to committee for three days to implement the changes.“My Republican colleagues’ so-called Medicaid cuts replacement fund is like giving aspirin to a cancer patient,” Markey said. “It is not enough. It is pathetically inadequate to deal with the health care crisis Republicans are creating here today on the Senate floor. No billionaire tax break or Donald Trump pat-on-the-back is worth the risk of people’s lives.”Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, spoke out against the proposal, saying that rural hospitals have long had financial challenges and that it was clearly “intended to derail this very bill.”“Unfortunately for far too long some rural hospitals have struggled to achieve financial stability, even with a wide-range of targeted payment enhances,” Crapo said. “These issues pre-date the consideration of the reforms that we are including in the legislation today.”",,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

Approved by lawmakers in April, the laws would prohibit social media platforms from promoting addictive behavior and allow parents to sue if their child is harmed due to content they’re exposed to.
NetChoice argued in a lawsuit filed Friday that the laws violate the First Amendment and are preempted by the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being sued for content created by users, according to the complaint.
Federal judge declares Arkansas social media age-verification law unconstitutional

Plaintiffs are asking a judge to declare the Arkansas laws unconstitutional and block them from going into effect. 
Friday, Eldredge & Clark, LLP from Arkansas and Clement & Murphy, PLLC from Virginia filed the lawsuit against Attorney General Tim Griffin and the state’s 28 prosecuting attorneys in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. 
Act 900 amends the state’s Social Media Safety Act, a 2023 law a federal judge permanently blocked in March. Amendments include prohibiting social media platforms from engaging in practices “to evoke any addiction or compulsive behaviors” in minors, and changing the definition of a minor to someone 16-years-old or younger.
NetChoice contends the amended Social Media Safety Act is “even more of an affront to the First Amendment” than its original version because it prohibits evoking addictive and compulsive behavior without clearly defining those terms. 
The complaint questions, for example, how many times a day users could check their social media account each day for it to be considered compulsive, and notes that the vague language would create a chilling effect on free speech by forcing people “to steer far wider of the unlawful zone” than they would if the law had clear boundaries.   
Act 901 allows parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, commiting or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
NetChoice Associate Director of Litigation Paul Taske said in a press release that it “violates the free speech rights of Arkansans and wastes taxpayer dollars on unconstitutional censorship.”
“Politicians cannot control what protected speech you see, say or share online — according to the Supreme Court itself. We are again suing the government of Arkansas to stop it,” Taske said. “Parents — not bureaucrats — should control how their children engage online.”


Let us know what you think...


 

While NetChoice’s members “strongly oppose” speech that promotes eating disorders or self-harm and already prohibit such content, the complaint argues that Arkansas’ new laws “impose even more restrictions and draconian sanctions” on social media platforms.
“By banning speech based on what impact it ultimately has on any user of the online service, the law sweeps in all manner of constitutionally protected expression that NetChoice members currently disseminate,” the complaint states.
Plaintiffs argue that parents already have several ways to restrict kids’ access to online services. Additionally, NetChoice members like Facebook and YouTube offer several parental controls to protect minors online, and have adopted policies prohibiting harmful content, according to the complaint.
NetChoice sued Arkansas two years ago over the Social Media Safety Act, which required age verification to create new social media accounts. The law was a priority for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office, and would have been the first law of its kind in the nation.
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction about two weeks before the law was set to take effect in 2023. The judge declared the law unconstitutional in March. Griffin filed a notice of appeal.
Two days after the judge’s ruling, Arkansas lawmakers filed two bills that supporters said were aimed at expanding social media protections for children. Both were sponsored by the lawmakers who ran the 2023 social media legislation, Republicans Sen. Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and Rep. Jon Eubanks of Paris. The governor signed them into law in April.
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks, the same federal judge who struck down the Social Media Safety Act.

(Greenleaf123 | Getty Images)In light of a decision issued by the United States Supreme Court earlier this month, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will now reconsider a case initially settled last year in which the court ruled it was discriminatory for states to ban individuals with government-sponsored health insurance from using that coverage for gender-affirming care.
The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the lower court’s decision in that case on Monday, according to the court docket. The higher court said the case should be reconsidered by the Fourth Circuit “in light of United States v. Skrmetti.”
The Skrmetti decision was issued on June 18. Supreme Court justices in that case ruled 6-3 to uphold a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. The majority said that children who seek such treatment don’t qualify as a protected class. Since they are not being denied the medications due to their sex, barring the treatments is not discrimination.
Upon release of the decision, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he was “optimistic” that the ruling would allow West Virginia to enforce other anti-trans policies that have been subject to court challenges — specifically, he said, the state law passed in 2021 that would bar trans children from playing on school sports teams that match their gender identity.
Action has yet to be taken on the trans sports law challenge, but it’s clear the order has opened the door for further consideration of — and overturning of decisions in — related cases.
The case now set to be reconsidered was originally filed as two separate cases — one for North Carolina and another for West Virginia. The cases were combined in 2023 following oral arguments in front of 4th Circuit judges.
The West Virginia plaintiff in the case is Shauntae Anderson, a trans woman who sued the former state Department of Health and Human Resources to challenge a 2004 law outlawing state coverage via Medicaid for gender-affirming surgeries due to gender dysphoria. 
In their initial ruling, the Fourth Circuit judges upheld decisions by lower courts in both North Carolina and West Virginia saying that state health care plans — specifically Medicaid in West Virginia — were obligated to cover certain health services for trans people, including gender-affirming surgeries for adults. 
“These two cases present the same question: Do health care plans that cover medically necessary treatments for certain diagnoses but bar coverage of those same medically necessary treatments for a diagnosis unique to transgender patients violate either the Equal Protection Clause or other provisions of federal law?” Judge Roger Gregory posed in the ruling. “We hold that they do, and therefore affirm the judgments of the district courts.”
Gregory presented the example of mastectomies and breast-reduction surgeries — which are covered by West Virginia Medicaid for diagnoses like cancer and excess breast tissue, but not for the legitimate diagnosis of gender dysphoria. 
To offer coverage in one case but not the other, the ruling read, is “obviously discriminatory.”
In a statement to the Associated Press last year, Anderson said West Virginia’s refusal to cover such procedures was “dehumanizing.”

President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa have refiled their lawsuit against the Des Moines Register and its former pollster, J. Ann Selzer, over the results of a 2024 Iowa Poll.
In an apparent move to keep Miller-Meeks and a former state representative as plaintiffs in the case, attorneys for the president dismissed their case in federal court on Monday while refiling their lawsuit in state court.
The lawsuit was initiated in December 2024 when Trump sued the Register, its parent company, Gannett, and Selzer in Polk County District Court, alleging the newspaper’s Iowa Poll, which was published shortly before the Nov. 5 election, deliberately overstated support for the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, by 16 percentage points.
Trump argued the poll amounted to “brazen election interference” and violated Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act. The defendants have denied the claims.
Attorneys for the president later expanded the lawsuit, adding claims by Miller-Meeks, a Republican who narrowly won reelection in the state’s 1st Congressional District, and by Brad Zaun, a former Republican state senator from Urbandale, who lost his bid for reelection.
At the defendants’ request, the case was transferred to federal court. However, a legal dispute soon arose over whether federal court was the proper forum for the case given the fact that Miller-Meeks and Zaun, like the defendants, are based in Iowa.
On May 23, 2025, a federal judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court. In that decision, the court allowed the president to file an appeal on the issue but also ordered Trump to file an amended complaint removing Miller-Meeks and Zaun from the case, eliminating any claims that were exclusive to the two Iowa-resident plaintiffs.
Trump was facing a July 18 deadline to file an amended complaint in federal court.
On Monday, the attorneys for the president filed a notice of dismissal in the federal case, notifying the court they were dropping their case without prejudice – indicating there was no settlement to the case and it could be refiled at a later date.
At roughly the same time, the president’s attorneys refiled the lawsuit in Polk County District Court, with Miller-Meeks and Zaun rejoining the president as co-plaintiffs.
As before, the lawsuit claims Selzer’s actions “impacted many other elections, including Rep. Miller-Meeks’ contest” and Zaun’s race against Democrat challenger Matt Blake in Iowa Senate District 22. “Selzer’s polling ‘miss’ was not an astonishing coincidence — it was intentional,” the lawsuit alleges. “As President Trump observed, ‘She knew exactly what she was doing.’”
The defendants in the case have yet to file a formal response to the newest court filing but have already denied the allegations in previous court filings.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

(Courtesy photos)Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) on Monday morning announced his candidacy in the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary for New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands, committing to build on the work of Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard and her predecessors.
Jonas Moya, a rancher from Tucumcari and former Biden-appointed state director for the Farm Service Agency, announced his candidacy on June 24.
Juan Sanchez, a former natural resource specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consultant for the New Mexico Acequia Commission, first joined the race in April.
As of Monday, no Republican candidates had filed to run, according to New Mexico Secretary of State data.
Voters in 2024 reelected McQueen to a two-year term in the state House of Representatives. Brian Morris, McQueen’s campaign manager, told Source NM on Monday that McQueen is not running for re-election to his House seat in the 2026 election, and instead running for Land Commissioner.
This means McQueen’s seat in the House will be on the primary and general election ballots next year, for the new term set to begin in January 2027, Morris said.
McQueen and Moya’s announcements both highlighted their intentions to protect public lands, and their opposition to a controversial and now defunct proposal in the U.S. Congress to sell federal lands.
McQueen’s announcement touts his work during six terms as a state lawmaker, including his co-sponsorship of reforms at the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and the state’s Strategic Water Reserve, and his support for the Land Grant Permanent Fund, which collects oil and gas royalties and primarily pays out to schools, universities and hospitals.
“I’m proud that New Mexico is now the first state in the nation to constitutionally guarantee our youngest children the right to early childhood education,” he said. “With responsible public land management, we can ensure that all our public institutions are receiving the funds necessary to ensure our children a successful future.”
Moya said the job of public lands commissioner is about protecting the fund and ensuring it benefits the public.
“It means balancing energy development with environmental stewardship, expanding outdoor access, and honoring the communities who’ve cared for this land for generations — tribes, acequia associations, and land grant heirs alike,” he said.
Moya’s announcement states that at the Farm Service Agency, he led disaster relief efforts, supported farmers and ranchers through drought and hardship and helped deliver hundreds of millions in aid.
“My word is my bond. That’s how I was raised — and that’s how I’ll lead. I’ll listen to the people who live on and work the land, not the political insiders,” Moya said. “Together, we can restore trust, protect our heritage, and build a better future for all New Mexicans.”

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)Community college leaders and advocates say they are feeling confused and left out of conversations that led to the list of eligible career fields for the Last-Dollar Scholarship program being cut down by one-third.
The Last-Dollar Scholarship program is a state-funded initiative to help students attending community colleges bridge the gap between financial aid and what’s left of tuition and fees that still need to be paid.
The Iowa Workforce Development Board voted in May to eliminate high-demand jobs in law enforcement, medical fields and more even though community college officials say the program is likely keep its streak of being underspent.

Students must be enrolled in academic programs corresponding to “high-demand” careers as determined by the state in order to receive their funding. Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said all 66 of the careers recommended by the organization fit the criteria to be included, but the state workforce board still voted to remove 20 occupations. The list is reviewed every two years, she said.
“When we’re helping students who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford college to afford it in any high demand area, then we’re helping the workforce,” Shields said. “The Legislature put a definition of high demand into code for this program, and everything we’ve recommended meets that definition.”
Shorter list eliminates public safety, health care jobs
Occupations removed from the list span criminal justice fields for law enforcement and firefighters, medical assisting, dental hygiene, dental assisting and wastewater, Shields said, alongside more “support function” roles like web design and secretarial work.
While the jobs list was cut by around one-third, Shields said there isn’t a one-to-one transfer to academic programs that can feed into those careers. In reality, she said about half of the academic programs cleared for Last-Dollar Scholarship recipients will no longer qualify for incoming students, according to calculations made by Iowa College Aid.
“Those are all programs that lead into occupations that are really critical right now in our communities,” Shields said.
Matt Thompson, president of Indian Hill Community College, who spoke alongside Shields during the meeting’s public comment section, said the change to the list will impact the community college’s future students and programs.
While students currently receiving a Last-Dollar Scholarship will continue to see support until their program is completed, Thompson said as many as 2,500 students will not be able to benefit from the scholarship while trying to earn the same credentials.
“When we work with a student population that is sometimes underrepresented, if not underresourced, having access to the Last-Dollar Scholarship program makes a huge difference in whether they plan to attend college or not,” Thompson said.
Program spending falls short of funding
This cut in programs comes as the Last-Dollar Scholarship program looks to be underspent for another year, college leaders say, after changes to student eligibility and among uncertainty surrounding federal financial aid.
According to the Last-Dollar Scholarship website, in fiscal year 2024 the state awarded $18.3 million in scholarships to more than 8,000 students, with an average award amount of just under $2,300. At Indian Hills Community College, 467 students received the scholarship in 2024.
Two years ago, the program was underspent by almost $6 million, Shields said, and while final numbers are not yet available, it seems like the program being underspent once again is a likely outcome. According to legislation signed this year by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, the scholarship program fund will receive almost $24 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
“I’ll add the caveat to all of that, that there is so much uncertainty with federal student aid right now, and since this is a last dollar scholarship, it will be significantly impacted by that,” Shields said. “So it is very, very hard to make predictions about what that’s going to look like.”
The board itself was split on whether to adopt the larger list recommended by community colleges or the state’s shorter list, with a proposed amendment to swap the state list for the college one failing with a 7-6 vote.
Board member Nick Glew said during the meeting he approached this decision from the perspective of needing to do whatever is possible to boost the workforce in Iowa. He said following community colleges’ recommendations would be the best decision for Iowans “as a whole,” because the colleges work with employers to provide the programming that best meets the businesses’ and students’ needs.
“I’m kind of disappointed that we have to kind of arm wrestle on this a little bit and figure out what the right way to go is,” Glew said.
Kelly Barrick, a board member who favored using the shorter list, disagreed that the longer list was appropriate due to the program being underspent. She said it’s not about getting anyone who studies for a job in Iowa money, but ensuring that it is well-spent within established parameters. Focusing on areas with the most need, like advanced manufacturing and health care, for the program will help fill the state’s most in-demand jobs.
Shields said the workforce board used to have a representative from the colleges as a member, but this was changed a few years ago. This year, the organization and colleges were told they could only participate through public comment.
She was told at a later meeting that Iowa code requires the board to work with the Iowa Board of Regents on their list of applicable jobs for the Iowa Workforce Grant but not community colleges.
“There has been more collaboration in the past, so this year was a little surprising on that front,” Shields said.
If community colleges had been consulted or had the opportunity to speak with the board before the list was finalized, Thompson said he would have been happy to go over all of the programs and see what compromises both groups could come to.
“We would just like to have the ability to sit down and have the conversation and plan with Iowa Workforce Development, and that just didn’t happen,” Thompson said.

Bowing to opposition from President Trump, the Healey administration on Monday put its offshore wind plans on hold yet again and said it is committed to an “all-of-the-above approach to energy.”
The post Healey again puts offshore wind on back burner appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BOWING TO OPPOSITION from President Trump, the Healey administration on Monday put its offshore wind plans on hold yet again and said it is committed to an “all-of-the-above approach to energy.” 
Price negotiations between the state’s utilities and two offshore wind developers were supposed to wrap up on Monday, but the parties filed a brief statement saying they couldn’t reach a deal “due to ongoing uncertainty caused by federal level activities.” The deadline was pushed back to December 31, the third time the timeline has been extended since Trump was elected. 
One wind farm – Vineyard Wind – is currently under construction off the Massachusetts coast. Bids for two other wind farms were accepted by the Healey administration in September 2024, but the developers and the state’s three utilities have been unable to reach agreement on a pricing contract because of the uncertainty in Washington.  
The new delay – and the likelihood that offshore wind contract deadlines will continue to be extended as long as Trump is in office – means Gov. Maura Healey will need to come up with a new climate strategy. The current strategy relies heavily on electrifying the housing and transportation sectors, but that approach will only reduce greenhouse gas emissions if the electricity being used is generated without fossil fuels.  
Offshore wind farms were expected to play a key role in decarbonizing electricity production, but Trump’s opposition to new and existing offshore wind projects has cast a pall over the industry. Republicans in the US Senate are now trying to deliver a death blow, doing away with existing tax credits and proposing a new excise tax on solar and wind projects that could drive prices up by an estimated 10 to 20 percent. 
Healey has not come up with a Plan B climate strategy yet, although a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy Resources issued a one-paragraph statement hinting at a new approach. 
“Massachusetts is committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, including offshore wind,” said the statement. “Offshore wind produced locally in Massachusetts will help lower costs, create thousands of jobs, and move us toward energy independence.” 
What’s unclear is what’s included in the all-of-the-above approach. An administration spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification. Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the Senate chair of the Legislature’s Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee, said he could only guess the governor’s intent. “I think the plain meaning of the words should be a guide,” he said. 
When former Gov. Charlie Baker used the “all-of-the-above” phrase in 2015, he said he wanted to develop solar and offshore wind as well as bring more natural gas into the region. Healey opposed pipeline expansion in 2015 and has bragged in the past about blocking gas pipelines coming into the region. 
Even so, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul succeeded in convincing Trump to allow an offshore wind farm off the coast of her state to resume construction after she agreed to consider adding natural gas pipeline capacity. 
Two other energy options available to Massachusetts are importing more hydro-electricity from Canada and expanding the region’s nuclear power capacity. Massachusetts has already procured additional hydro-electricity from Quebec and is now waiting for the transmission line that will carry the power into New England to be completed. 
Barrett said he thinks nuclear power expansion is more likely than construction of a new gas pipeline, but he acknowledged that there is a lot of uncertainty right now on the energy front. 
One of the developers, Ocean Winds, has indicated it will not move forward until the situation in Washington becomes clearer. In a filing earlier this month with state regulators, Ocean Winds said Massachusetts should review the situation every quarter until the federal outlook becomes more stable or Trump leaves office in 2029. 
Avangrid, the other wind farm developer, submitted a heavily redacted filing to state regulators that didn’t say whether it would proceed with its project. But the company said the procurement process must change to give developers more flexibility in dealing with the roadblocks thrown up by a presidential administration opposed to offshore wind.

Without this change, offshore wind will not succeed.”

The proposed bill would repeal numerous clean energy tax credits and programs that directly benefit Kentuckians. These tax credits are helping individuals, small businesses, farmers and corporations alike reduce their energy bills, increase energy independence, and build new energy resources in Kentucky. 
The harm this would cause would be widespread and felt by people across the commonwealth, through increased energy costs, business closures, layoffs, lost economic development, and reduced access to low-cost renewable energy. Among its many harmful provisions, the House version of the bill would:

Terminate residential tax credits for solar, batteries and energy efficiency measures at the end of 2025.
Rapidly phase out commercial solar tax credits, ending the credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after passage of the bill. 
End tax credits for new and used electric vehicles at the end of 2025.

These tax credits are presently planned to last until at least 2032, to provide the long-term stability and predictability needed to support private investment in hiring, infrastructure, and manufacturing. Abruptly ending these tax incentives will sabotage the growth of these industries and the promise they offer to Kentucky and the nation.
Solar, wind, and battery storage are now essential contributors to the nation’s electric grid and economy. In 2024, solar accounted for 61% of all new electric generation capacity built in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there were 365,000 people employed in the solar industry in 2023. Solar is now the lowest-cost source of electricity and batteries are used at-scale to maintain grid reliability and reduce costs at times of peak demand. Nationwide, solar supplied 7% of all electricity produced in 2024, a remarkable fact considering it accounted for less than 0.1% in 2010. Solar and wind now account for nearly 25% of the nation’s electricity supply. 
Recent years have seen major growth in Kentucky’s clean energy sector, with billions of dollars of investment in new battery factories and utility-scale and rooftop solar, creating thousands of jobs in communities across Kentucky. Despite its relatively small population, Kentucky has seen some of the greatest investments in clean energy infrastructure in the country. These investments are helping support grid reliability and reduce costs for consumers.
Among these developments are factories for manufacturing batteries and their components for the EV and utility industries in Bowling Green, Shelbyville, Hardin County and Hopkinsville; utility-scale solar facilities being developed on reclaimed mine lands in Martin and Pike County; and thousands of individual homes and businesses installing solar to reduce their utility costs.
These developments are threatened by the budget bill passed by House Republicans and now being considered in the Senate. There is still time to remove these provisions from the reconciliation bill. Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell can stand up for Kentucky by preserving these clean energy tax credits.

The announcement came Monday in a news release posted to the private Catholic university’s website. The university said senior leadership assessed its financial situation and its long-term sustainability and concluded continuing beyond the academic year was not feasible.
“For 105 Years, Siena Heights University has been a beacon of light in a world sometimes cast in darkness,” said Siena Heights University President Douglas Palmer in a statement. “The spirit of Siena Heights will continue long after the institution itself closes its doors because it lives in every graduate, faculty member, and staff person who has been on campus – whether in-person or online.”

Current student academic progress and creating transfer pathways with partner institutions with as little disruption as possible will be the priority for the university as it works to close its doors.
The university was founded in 1919 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, which along with the university’s board of trustees supported the move to close the school named after Saint Catherine of Siena.
“We are deeply grateful to the faculty, staff, students, and alumni who have worked hard decade after decade to make Siena Heights an incredibly special place,” Palmer said. “We look ahead to the next academic year planning all the activities one would normally get including athletics, residential life, and great events that we share with our alumni and entire community.”

Plaintiffs argued the statute would indirectly ban abortion medications by threatening providers with disciplinary action for off-label prescription use.
The post Judge blocks abortion restrictions in Wyoming’s new off-label medication law appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming judge on Monday blocked the state from enforcing abortion restrictions included in a new law that protects doctors who prescribe off-label medications.
In his nine-page ruling, District Judge Thomas T.C. Campbell sided with a group of abortion rights advocates who argued the law, which is set to go into effect Tuesday, would indirectly ban common abortion medications by threatening doctors and pharmacists with disciplinary action for prescribing the drugs for off-label use. The plaintiffs asked Campbell to halt enforcement while their broader lawsuit against abortion restrictions in Wyoming plays out.
Campbell rejected arguments from state attorneys defending the law as simply attempting to align the statute with two abortion bans that lawmakers passed in 2023. A different judge struck down both of those bans last year, and the Wyoming Supreme Court is now weighing an appeal on that case.

State attorneys further argued the new statute merely made clear that off-label prescriptions for non-abortion drugs would be protected under Wyoming law. Campbell, however, was unconvinced.
“To argue that the statute does not prohibit the off-label prescription of abortion-inducing drugs but merely permits off-label use for other indications, is a strained and untenable reading,” he wrote. “If the statute excludes abortion-related prescriptions from the safe harbor it creates, then it necessarily treats those prescriptions as not lawful under this provision.
“Suggesting that this exclusion simply ‘does not make it illegal’ but instead merely withholds new authorization is semantic hair-splitting; in practical terms, the statute draws a bright line between permissible off-label uses and those it aims to restrict, abortion among them,” Campbell continued. “For these reasons, the court cannot accept the State Defendants’ claim that the Wyoming Off-Label Protection Laws do not attempt to limit access to abortion medication when that is precisely what it does.”
The most common regimen of abortion medications includes the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Typically, a patient takes mifepristone first, then misoprostol later.
Health care amendment
Campbell’s ruling is the latest in a string of court victories for abortion access advocates in Wyoming. The same group of plaintiffs — including Casper’s Wellspring Health Access, the state’s lone abortion clinic — successfully challenged the 2023 abortion bans and convinced Campbell earlier this year to temporarily block additional restrictions, including a mandatory ultrasound and 48-hour waiting period.
All of those challenges have pointed to a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment allows legislators to enact certain restrictions, but the government must demonstrate a compelling public interest in doing so.

The government, Campbell wrote, did not identify such an interest, nor could the court independently find one.
“Thus, because provisions of the Wyoming Off-Label Protection Laws interfere with one’s fundamental right to make healthcare decisions, and the laws achieve no apparent compelling government interest, at this stage in the proceedings, the court finds that there is a likelihood of success that Plaintiffs prevail on their challenge to the constitutionality of the
statute, both facially and as applied,” he wrote.
Common prescription practice
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration approves medications for certain uses and in certain doses. But doctors commonly prescribe medications for off-label purposes — in other words, uses not approved by the FDA. For example, doctors sometimes prescribe propranolol for anxiety even though it’s been approved as a blood pressure medication. A medication in a different dose than what the FDA approved would also qualify as off-label use.
Interest in protecting the practice of off-label prescriptions grew in the wake of the COVID pandemic, when some providers faced possible disciplinary action for prescribing hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved malaria drug, to treat the virus. Then Rep. Sarah Penn, R-Lander, drafted a bill protecting off-label prescriptions in 2023, but it failed to advance. 
Earlier this year, Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, successfully brought back a similar measure. House Bill 164, “Medical prescriptions-off-label purposes,” codified the practice of prescribing off-label medications in Wyoming. But it specified those protections did not apply to schedule I or II controlled substances (such as heroin or fentanyl), gender care for children and medications intended to induce an abortion.

(Getty Images)Clean energy advocates are warning that the most recent version of the congressional special bill that proposes to cut credits and implement significant restrictions to clean energy projects could raise prices for Mainers, threaten new industry jobs and thwart the state’s climate goals.
“By every measure this bill is a disaster for the hard-working people of Maine, and it will be especially devastating for the clean air and water that is central to our way of life,” said Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. 
For those reasons and larger climate concerns driving the state’s transition away from fossil fuels, Fetcher along with industry heads are asking U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to “stand up for Maine” and vote against the bill. 
The U.S. Senate released its 940-page version of the spending bill just after midnight on Friday. In a last minute change to the Senate proposal, Republican leadership added language to phase out clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act by 2027.
The bill would also impose a steep penalty on all new wind and solar farms that come online after that date, unless they follow new tightened restrictions on imported components, namely from China.  
Collins voted along with the majority of her party over the weekend to begin the marathon debate and amendment process, which is expected to last until Tuesday.
While she supports the tax relief portion of the spending bill, Collins said in a statement Monday afternoon that she opposes other elements, including the new excise tax and other “burdensome provisions on energy projects.”
“We have many more amendments to go through and debate to be had before we vote on final passage,” Collins added. 
In the most recent iteration, senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally, credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.
Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.
In addition to concerns that the bill could worsen already increasing energy costs, Nicholas Janzen, policy and partnerships director for Maine Conservation Voters, said that eliminating the clean energy tax credits could threaten the more than 15,000 clean energy jobs in the state.  
“Senator Collins must decide today if she will stand with her constituents who overwhelmingly oppose increased energy bills and losing clean energy jobs,” he said. 
Maine’s budding offshore wind industry has already faced setbacks under President Donald Trump but the credit rollback could further derail plans, despite offshore wind being a key component of Maine’s goal of reaching 100% clean energy by 2040.
Dan Clapp, chief executive officer of regional solar company ReVision Energy, said Mainers could also face higher power bills if the proposal were to pass in its current form. The bill would undercut solar, wind and energy storage efforts and in turn drive up project costs, which would ultimately cause greater reliance on fossil fuels with volatile prices, he said. 
Clapp also asked Collins to back an amendment introduced by other senators to remove the new excise tax on the industry.
“Maine can’t afford this bill,” he said. 
This comes after members of Maine’s solar and energy storage industry asked Collins in early June to protect the clean energy tax credits that were proposed to be scaled back in the U.S. House of Representatives version of the spending bill. 
The nearly 70 industry representatives cited three credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act that specifically support solar panel manufacturing and deployment that they asked the senator to protect.

Joseph Cervantes.","A sign marking a cannabis dispensary in Santa Fe county. The state's Regulation and Licensing Department will soon hire a police chief tasked with leading a new crew of certified police officers to enforce criminal violations of the state's cannabis laws. Lawmakers also are pushing for action addressing the high number of licenses in the state. (Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source New Mexico)More than three years after New Mexico legalized recreational marijuana, the state has become a national poster-child for recreational marijuana sales, and not in a good way, argues State Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces).
“We’ve become the mecca for ‘mota’,” Cervantes said, using a slang term for marijuana common in New Mexico. “And we have to ask ourselves: Is that really what we want to be?”
He and other state lawmakers on the Legislature’s interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee met Monday morning in Taos to discuss the proliferation of shops across the state, as well as their hopes for a new band of cannabis officers tasked with enforcing laws the Legislature enacted when it legalized recreational marijuana in April 2022.
Since legalizing cannabis, New Mexico retailers have sold about $1.7 billion combined in adult-use and medical cannabis, with the help of more than 1,600 licensed cannabis-related businesses such as retailers, testing labs and producers, according to a presentation from state Regulation and Licensing Department officials who spoke at the committee meeting. 
New Mexico House to consider strengthening cannabis regulation

While the industry is booming, high-profile examples of marijuana scofflaws in the state prompted lawmakers this session to pass House Bill 10, which funds the hiring and training of a new team of fully certified law enforcement officers empowered to bring criminal charges against those they suspect are lying about the source of the marijuana, exploiting their workers or altering the drug.
In the coming days, the state will advertise for a police chief in charge of the new crew of officers, according to Clay Bailey, superintendent of the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Division. From there, they’ll hire up to six more officers. 
“I really want seasoned people that know what they’re doing, [who have] dealt with drugs and things, and know what they’re getting into,” Bailey said of the new hires. 
HB10 also empowers the new officers to do more forensic accounting within the state’s system for tracking growers from seed to sale. The new hires free up inspectors to undertake audits to determine, for example, whether growers are lying about where their inventory came from or if they’re flooding the market with illegal products, Bailey said.
40 dispensaries and one grocery store
No limits exist in state law on the number of licenses that can be issued, and local jurisdictions also cannot ban cannabis dispensaries from operating, according to the Regulation and Licensing Division, though they can control how far apart they must be. Maestas suggested lawmakers change state law to grant control over licenses to towns and cities. 
In Sunland Park, which borders Texas where recreational marijuana is illegal, up to 40 cannabis retailers exist, state officials said Monday. 
“This is just not healthy,” said Cervantes, whose senate district includes Sunland Park. “This is not a healthy environment for my community, for Sunland Park to have 36 [to] 40 dispensaries, one grocery store, maybe one liquor store.”
According to state data presented Monday, the town of less than 20,000 people has generated the second-highest amount of marijuana revenue in the state since April 2022. Regulators have tallied more than $127 million in recreational sales revenue from nearly 3 million transactions. Albuquerque, the highest-earning city, has generated more than $350 million.
According to a 2024 Pew Research Center study, Oklahoma has the highest number of marijuana dispensaries per capita in the country, with 36 per 100,000 residents. Cervantes estimated New Mexico to be about 30 per 100,000, which puts it far ahead of early marijuana adopters California and Colorado. 
A coalition of about 100 cannabis businesses in June 2023 asked the governor to issue a pause on new licenses, saying they faced too much competition and chaos from a “flourishing” black market. 
The issue has not gone away. Several lawmakers said they want to see the issue addressed in next year’s 30-day legislative session. Though budget-focused, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could deem the topic germane. 
“I hope you’ll ask the governor to fix what needs to be fixed,” Cervantes told the state cannabis regulators at the meeting, “and have us do that in the remaining administration in the 30-day session coming up.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday afternoon. However, in a town hall meeting in July in Española, the governor did acknowledge that the state needed to fix its process for licensing, in response to a resident’s complaint about the number of dispensaries. 
“Expect the state to propose some restrictions,” the governor said, drawing applause, saying that the licensing “didn’t roll out the way we intended for it to roll out.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-5612-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on June 30, 2025.
The “Everyone is Welcome Here” sign that sparked a viral nationwide controversy can no longer be displayed in Idaho schools, according to an Idaho attorney general’s office opinion released late Friday.
The revelation became public a day after Idaho EdNews received a redacted version of the opinion, which the Idaho Department of Education used to write its guidance on the flags-in-schools law.

House Bill 41, which goes into effect Tuesday, prohibits flags or banners depicting a political viewpoint from public K-12 schools. The law’s vague language led to questions from educators and school leaders.
The Department of Education asked the attorney general’s office on March 28 for guidance on the new law. It took the attorney general’s office until May 29 to provide a response. The department then took nearly another month to provide guidance to school districts, which it did Thursday.
That guidance said school employees cannot display flags or banners that show opinions, emotions, beliefs or thoughts about politics, economics, society, faith or religion. The guidance and the attorney general’s opinion did not define these terms.
Idaho Department of Education asked AG for guidance on ‘Everyone is welcome here sign’
The attorney general’s opinion released to EdNews Thursday had one section redacted, pertaining to signs West Ada School District teacher Sarah Inama had displayed in her classroom for years. One sign read “Everyone is Welcome Here.”
West Ada administrators said the signs — including one displaying open hands of different skin tones — violated district policy. Inama refused to remove the sign, and in March, her story attracted national media coverage.
The Idaho Department of Education asked the attorney general’s office if Inama’s signs in particular violated the new law.
The attorney general’s office said yes.
“These signs are part of an ideological/social movement which started in Twin Cities, Minnesota following the 2016 election of Donald Trump,” the attorney general’s response reads. “Since that time, the signs have been used by the Democratic party as a political statement. The Idaho Democratic Party even sells these signs as part of its fundraising efforts.”
The opinion then links to a news story from a Minnesota news station back in 2017 when a group of women came together against hate after racist graffiti appeared at Maple Grove High School the day after Trump’s 2016 election. Their signs read “All are Welcome Here.” The founders of the movement told the TV station that their movement was about combating hate and was nonpartisan and secular.
The signs were popular at Minnesota schools, according to the story.
The Idaho Democratic Party did not begin selling the signs until March 25, after Inama’s story went viral, communications director Avery Roberts said. Roberts said the signs and stickers are sold nearly at cost and aren’t a tool to make money but instead to show support for Inama and inclusivity.
“Across the state, parents and teachers, regardless of their political affiliations, want children to have a fair shot. They’re working hard to build strong public schools where every student feels welcome and has the support they need to succeed,” Roberts wrote in an email to EdNews. “What matters is the message. Taking a stand against discrimination shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and we hope leaders in every party see it that way.”
The opinion went on to note that Inama began displaying the signs in 2017, shortly after Trump’s first election, and that Inama said she hung the sign to “share her personal, ideological beliefs.”
Inama did not respond to request for comment.
In a March interview, Inama told EdNews that she found the West Ada’s request to remove the signs “disturbing,” and said it seemed like district officials were trying to avoid potential complaints from people with “exclusionary” beliefs.
“That’s appeasing, not a political view, but a bigoted view that shouldn’t even be considered by a public school district,” Inama said.
Where she first went public with the story, she said administrators told her the signs were not “content neutral,” and were “a personal opinion,” she told KTVB. “I was told … that ‘everyone is welcome here’ is not something that everybody believes.”
Inama disagreed. “I feel like this is the basis of public education.”
Following Inama’s KTVB interview, dozens of Boise School District leaders and teachers sported “Everyone is Welcome Here” T-shirts in a social media post. Boise hired Inama to teach there next school year. Inama told EdNews earlier this month she planned to put up her inclusive signs in her new Boise classroom.
The Department of Education decided to release the unredacted attorney general’s opinion at 5:30 p.m. Friday. The department did not explain the timing, and has yet to respond to a request for comment.

In broad terms, these policies will focus on reshaping the state’s K-12 education system, addressing financial challenges facing Mississippi’s pension system for state workers, expanding voting rights and addressing infrastructure challenges facing the capital city of Jackson. 
Days after White announced the formation of three new select committees to study key policy areas ahead of the 2026 session, White spoke Monday to the Mississippi State University Stennis Institute of Government and Capitol Press Corps.
White offered more specifics on the legislative strategy he plans to push next year after a 2025 legislative session shaped by Republican infighting, historic tax reforms and uncertainty at the federal level.
House will propose ‘school choice/education freedom’ package
The House will propose one sprawling education reform package containing many of the “school choice” provisions that died last session, White said. 
This is a departure from the piecemeal strategy House Republicans undertook last session, where the chamber passed a series of standalone education bills. Many of the House’s bills either died in the Senate or, in the case of a proposal that would have allowed some Mississippi parents to use taxpayer money to pay for private schools, didn’t come up for a vote on the House floor. 
The new approach is modeled after the sweeping tax reform package that the Legislature passed last session and the “Big Beautiful Bill” moving through the Republican-controlled Congress.
“I think it’s why you see even in our national Congress now considering that one huge bill because in the volatile political world that we live in, there are things in there that folks for whatever reason, because of a certain voter base or political ideology, they say they can’t go there, but there are enough good things (in the bill) that they’re able to get there,” White said. 
The congressional measure, which was being debated Monday in the United States Senate, could itself alter public education funding in states around the country.
Next session, White said the House will introduce a “comprehensive” package containing all of its key priorities, which include lifting restrictions on public school transfers, closing and consolidating some schools, and allowing Mississippi children being home-schooled to play public school sports. 
White also said he wants to focus on social factors, such as poverty, that may hinder academic performance. 
“It’s going to be comprehensive, it’ll be bold and it’ll be uncomfortable,” White said. “It’ll be uncomfortable for me, it’ll be uncomfortable for people in my own caucus, and for people on the other side of the aisle. But it can absolutely alter the (education) landscape.”
White said he is a proponent of “universal school choice,” which often refers to policies that allow all households — regardless of income level — to use public education dollars to send their children to private schools or other institutions of their choice, rather than being assigned to public schools based on where they live. 
But White acknowledged on Monday that there haven’t been enough votes in his chamber to advance such a measure, a political reality he traced back to the racial politics of education in Mississippi. Following the Civil Rights reforms of the 1960s, many private schools in Mississippi opened as bulwarks against racial integration.
White, who favors the term “education freedom” instead of the “school choice” moniker embraced by most conservative education groups, said the new Education Freedom Select Committee will examine education policies passed by many other Republican-controlled legislatures nationwide.
Finding a “dedicated revenue stream” for PERS 
White said the House will try again to pass legislation with a “dedicated revenue stream” for the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, which currently faces an over $25 billion unfunded liability.
White said his House Republican Caucus still favors either diverting most of the state’s lottery proceeds to PERS or legalizing mobile sports betting and using the revenue to help make the pension system solvent. These proposals will be the subject of another House select committee.
The Senate has favored a “hybrid” retirement plan to shore up the system financially by cutting benefits for future employees. 
Voter Rights
The House will again aim to implement early voting in Mississippi, which is one of only three states without no-excuse early voting or no-excuse absentee voting.
Senate leaders, on the last day of their regular 2025 session, decided not to send a bill to Gov. Tate Reeves that would have expanded pre-Election Day voting options. The governor has been vocally opposed to early voting in Mississippi and would likely have vetoed the measure.
A House Voters’ Rights Select Committee will examine paths forward for restoring suffrage for individuals convicted of crimes who have completed their sentences. The committee will also explore re-establishing a ballot initiative process, an effort that has failed for several years in a row after the previous initiative process was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
In the Senate, such a measure would have to go through the Accountability, Efficiency, Transparency committee, where last session it died under the leadership of Republican chairman Sen. David Parker.
Parker is not running for reelection, a development that bodes well for restoring the ballot initiative process, White said Monday, without naming Parker. 
Jackson-related bills and local projects
The Capital and Metro Revitalization Select Committee, established in 2024, will continue to focus on local governance issues in the capital city of Jackson after helping pass five bills into law last session.
In 2026, White said, the House will focus on addressing infrastructure woes plaguing Jackson’s water and sewer systems. White said the state would not aim to “take over” the systems, a concern often voiced by Democrats, almost all of whom are Black, about the majority-white, Republican-controlled Legislature usurping local rule in Jackson. 
Last session, a source of Republican infighting between the House and Senate concerned whether to pass a “Christmas Tree” bill, or a bill that appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars in local projects around the state. To the House’s chagrin, that never happened, and White said he remains “disappointed” in the Senate leadership over the disagreement. 
“We should have funded local projects, and we didn’t because of politics and nothing else,” White said. 
White said he heard the Senate might introduce a local projects bill in January next session, earlier than normal, but he remains concerned the chambers are far from reaching an agreement.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10091707/Legislative-Session-2025-1.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

Daugaard endorsed U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Johnson’s possible opponents for the nomination include current Gov. Larry Rhoden, whose lieutenant governor is Tony Venhuizen. Daugaard is Venhuizen’s father-in-law.
Rhoden was the lieutenant governor for Kristi Noem, and he’s serving the remainder of her term after she left in January to lead the federal Department of Homeland Security. Rhoden picked Venhuizen, who was a state legislator, as his lieutenant governor. 
Saying it’s time for a ‘new chapter,’ Dusty Johnson announces his campaign for governor

Rhoden has not yet announced whether he will run for his own term as governor next year, or whether Venhuizen would be his running mate. Venhuizen declined to comment Monday when contacted by South Dakota Searchlight.
Following Daugaard’s attendance at Johnson’s campaign event Monday in Sioux Falls, Daugaard told South Dakota Searchlight that his endorsement honors a promise he made previously to Johnson.
“I think when you say you are going to do something, you should do it,” Daugaard said, adding he doesn’t know what Rhoden is going to do. Daugaard described Rhoden as a friend and an honorable public servant.
Johnson and Venhuizen each served stints as Daugaard’s chief of staff — Johnson from 2011 to 2014, and Venhuizen from 2014 to 2019.
At Johnson’s Monday campaign event, Daugaard described Johnson as a bridge-builder and problem-solver.
“As my chief of staff, Dusty helped me cut $127 million from our state budget to get it back to balance,” Daugaard said, “without raising taxes and without cutting vital services, either, but by doing what great leaders do: getting people together, and finding consensus about ways the work can be done. And listening to different perspectives — always putting South Dakota first.”
Daugaard has also frequently praised his son-in-law, including when Venhuizen was chosen as lieutenant governor in January. At the time, Daugaard said he was “very proud” of Venhuizen.
“He will be a great help to Governor Rhoden,” Daugaard said then. “I know they’ll be complimentary to each other, and I couldn’t be happier for Tony.”

Lonnie Everill, 46, of Water Valley, whose work focused on supervising and rehabilitating sexual offenders, was sentenced in federal court, months after receiving over 1,400 images sent and received over a four-month period.
An FBI investigation began after Everill sent chats with an undercover agent about arranging to travel to California and have sex with a child Everill believed was the agent’s niece, according to court records. 
They began to exchange chats after Everill joined a public group on the platform KIK that the agent was in – a group with about 100 members who were exchanging child sexual abuse material and talking about children. 
Investigators found images and videos of young children and toddlers not being sexually abused on Everill’s accounts. The material also included selfies of Everill and pictures of local minors not engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 
Joyner and Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI Jackson Field Office, called the crime a betrayal of trust for the victims, community and credibility of federal probation officers in the district. 
Everill had worked in several states including Mississippi, according to Joyner’s office. 
“No matter their badge or title, the FBI will always aggressively pursue those that prey on our children,” Eikhoff said in a statement. 
U.S. District Judge Dan Jordan sentenced Everill to 10 years in the Bureau of Prisons followed by 10 years of supervised release. Everill will be required to register as a sex offender, and the judge also ordered requirements meant to restrict Everill’s access to children and the internet.

(Courtesy NPS)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials established a new Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) Management Zone comprising Hunting District 170 in the Flathead Valley.
Announced last week, the new zone increases hunting opportunities in a management area centered on the Flathead County landfill north of Kalispell. It follows the detection of CWD in white-tailed deer for the first time in the hunting district in October of last year.
In early October 2024, FWP officials received reports of a symptomatic buck near the Flathead County landfill and euthanized the animal. Initial and followup CWD testing returned a positive result.
The disease always results in death for infected animals and there is no known cure.
“By implementing this CWD Management Zone and increasing harvest opportunities, we aim to reduce local deer density and curb the potential spread of this disease,” Franz Ingelfinger, an FWP wildlife biologist, said in a press release. “Hunting is the primary tool for monitoring and managing the spread of CWD, and we appreciate hunters helping us take an aggressive, localized approach to this.”

Chronic Wasting Disease affects members of the deer family, including elk, moose, mule deer, and white-tailed deer and is caused by a malformed prion protein. Symptomatic animals can exhibit neurological and behavioral changes and emaciation.
Within the new management zone, which has a roughly five-mile radius around the landfill, hunters can purchase an over-the-counter B license for white-tailed deer. Hunters are limited to one license, valid through archery, general, heritage muzzleloader and late season, with no overall quote on the new license.
FWP is also increasing the number of 170-00 antlerless white-tailed B licenses available per hunter from one to two, valid throughout Hunting District 170.
In a press release, FWP officials said they aim to assess the prevalence and extent of CWD in the area while reducing local deer density to slow the disease’s spread and prevalence in the area. All hunters are encouraged to get harvested animals sampled for CWD.
The detection of CWD at the landfill underscores the urgency of localized management, according to the press release.

Mike DeWine is expected to issue vetoes on the state’s operating budget on Monday night. The most likely to be axed: provisions dealing with children, health care and home rule.
With the flick of a pen, DeWine can preserve the GOP budget — or kill whichever provision he wants.
All eyes in the Ohio Statehouse are on the governor’s desk.
“Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of provisions that are gonna do real damage to the people of Ohio,” state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said.


The governor’s priorities as the leader of Ohio have always been clear: children.


Here’s where he may use his veto pen


In evaluating how DeWine works, his previous vetoes, and his statements over the past several months, some clues emerge.


“He’s disappointed by things that are in the budget,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.
This list is non-exhaustive.
State lawmakers voted to restrict access to Medicaid for babies ages 0-3.
They capped funding for lead poisoning prevention each year.
They also eliminated the advisory council on how to handle rare diseases.
Other provisions cut mental health assistance, something the governor has championed.
“Continue our efforts in regard to mental health, this is something that is so vitally important for Ohio to move forward,” the governor said in mid-June.
The lawmakers also put restrictions on what H2Ohio, DeWine’s clean water program, can do.
“Clean water in the state of Ohio is essential to us,” he said, previously saying that the House’s cuts to the program worried him.
DeWine has always emphasized the importance of libraries and reading for children. One provision in the budget DeWine may veto requires public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public. This means that even books that reference a female character in the title could be blocked, according to a Northeast Ohio librarian.
“These libraries are free. They’re the center of the community many times. They’re places where you can go and your kids can go,” DeWine told reporters on Saturday. “I’ll have more to say about it.”
There are also provisions that stop funding for both youth homeless shelters and mental health services that support transgender or nonbinary identities. The governor has previously vetoed legislation that would ban gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ youth, but the legislature passed an override. He has spoken at length about how this care was essential for these children’s mental health.
Another veto possibility is a provision taking away some of the school districts’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and requiring anything above that mark be refunded to taxpayers.
“This is a state that, by and large, gives due respect to the local communities in regard to running the schools,” he said on Saturday.
Other restrictions include the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. In the budget, there are many smaller items impacting how schools manage their money that could all be up for veto.
“As far as the financing and other things, we leave a lot of that to the local community,” the governor said.
Legislation that the governor has not supported includes state funding for the new Cleveland Browns stadium — although he likes the most current version using unclaimed funds better than using bonds — and the proposed 2.75% flat income tax.
“Not one time did a company say I can’t come to Ohio because your income tax is too high,” the governor said in May, adding that a full repeal of an income tax or a flat tax could cause detriments to social services. “We’d have to look at what the consequences are and what impact that might have on our ability to fund education and do other things.”
DeWine’s vetoes will come out Monday before midnight. He is set to have a press conference to explain his decisions on Tuesday.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard for Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa drivers will be more likely to get pulled over after July 1 if they are behind the wheel with their cellphones in their hands. This new law is one of many passed by the Iowa Legislature during the 2025 session set to go into effect at the beginning of July.
Senate File 22 bans the use of cellphones and electronic devices when not in voice activated or hands-free mode while operating a vehicle. Police officers will begin pulling over distracted drivers and charging them with a warning starting July 1. Come January 2026, offenders will be charged with a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine between $100 and $850.
Here are 10 more laws that create additional criminal penalties or expand the definition of previous crimes that go into effect July 1:
Driving with an open-container THC beverage
House File 181 prohibits open-container beverages containing THC in the passenger area of motor vehicles. People are allowed to transport open-beverage THC drinks in the trunk of their vehicles but if it’s anywhere else in the car, and they risk being charged with a simple misdemeanor punishable by a $260 fine.

Gift card fraud
Senate File 260 creates a graduated penalty for altering or tampering with a gift card with intent to defraud. Under the new law, a violator commits forgery and is guilty of different charges based on the fraudulent amount or value of goods purchased with a fraudulent card. The crime is a class C felony if more than $5,000 is uploaded to a card or obtained in stolen goods; a class D felony if the fraudulent value is between $5,000 and $1,000; an aggravated misdemeanor if the fraudulent value is between $1,000 and $500, and a serious misdemeanor if the fraudulent value is under $500.
Additionally, the value of retail merchandise fraudulently obtained within a six-month period will be aggregated and the defendant will be charged for the total amount. 
Critical infrastructure sabotage
House File 879 expands the definition of “critical infrastructure sabotage” to include a telecommunications service, information service or cable service, a wireless service or broadband generation, transmission or delivery service. Individuals found guilty of willfully impairing critical infrastructure are guilty of a class B felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison and a fine between $85,000 and $100,000.
Grooming
House File 180 defines grooming as an attempt to persuade a minor to commit an unlawful sexual act, punishable as a class D felony. Individuals found guilty will be classified as tier 1 sex offenders. Those convicted are subject to 10 years in prison, with possibility of parole. This law explicitly includes law enforcement sting operations within the statute, meaning even if the intended victim is an undercover police officer, individuals can be prosecuted for grooming.
Distribution of obscene material to a minor
Under House File 306, people age 18 or older who knowingly share or exhibit obscene material to a minor, other than the parents or guardian of the minor, are guilty of a public offense. 
Upon first offense, violators will be charged with a serious misdemeanor and subject to up to one year in jail and/or $430-2,560 in fines. A second offense is an aggravated misdemeanor and subject to a minimum mandatory confinement of one year which will not be deferred or suspended. Following a third offense, individuals are charged with a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of three years.
Minor-to-minor distribution of obscene material is also considered a public offense and individuals under 18 found guilty will be charged with a serious misdemeanor.
Assault on a health care provider 
House File 310 expands the definition of health care providers to protect against assault. Anyone working, volunteering or participating in an educational course at a hospital or rural emergency hospital or nursing home is now protected under this law. 
Persons found guilty of assaulting a health care provider under the new definition can be charged based on the severity of the assault ranging from serious misdemeanor to a class “C” felony based on the severity.
Human trafficking
House File 649 expands the definition of human trafficking. Someone who attempts to purchase services like commercial sexual activity from a law enforcement professional posing as a trafficker commits a class “D” felony. 
The bill also expanded the definition of “services” to no longer require an “ongoing relationship” between the person who requests unlawful services and the victim. The new definition is performing activities under the supervision of or for the benefit of another, including commercial sexual activity and sexually explicit performances.
The new definition of “victim” now includes all of the following: a person subjected to human trafficking, a person identified as being subjected or targeted for human trafficking and a law enforcement official impersonating a human trafficking victim. A class D felony is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a fine ranging between $750 and $7,500.
Possession of visual depictions of minor engaged in unlawful sex act
Senate File 150 ensures persons in possession of visual depictions containing pictorial representations of a minor engaging in a prohibited sexual act, including altered or edited pictures, of different minors will be punished with separate offenses for each “pictorial representation.” Multiple depictions of the same minor engaging in a prohibited sexual act will now be prosecuted as separate offenses for each representation. A person guilty of this offense will be charged with a class “D” felony for a first offense, and a class C felony for subsequent offenses.
Assault on law enforcement professional
Senate File 397 expands penalties for assault on persons engaged in certain professions. Under this bill, assault against a peace officer, jailer, correctional or juvenile detention staff, or employee of the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing who conducts investigations or inspections, is punishable up to a class C felony. All individuals found guilty of assault on these protected professions must serve a minimum term of seven days. 
Additionally, the definition of assault has been expanded to include contact with saliva through tossing, spitting or throwing. 
Firearm possession by felons
Senate File 462 significantly increases penalties for firearm possession by felons for repeat offenders. First-time offenders face a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of two years; second-time offenders would face a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of four years; third-time offenders would face a class C felony with a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence and fourth or subsequent offenses would face a 10-year sentence recommendation. The bill prevents courts from deferring or suspending sentences, except for first-time offenders with a county attorney recommendation.

(Photo via Google Earth)An Iowa judge has paused a malpractice case against a cosmetic surgeon who recently surrendered her license after being charged with professional incompetence.
In May 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Lindsay Sturm of Sturm Cosmetic Surgery in Ames with professional incompetence, which includes failure by a physician to exercise a degree of care ordinarily exercised by the average physician.
The board alleged Sturm failed to meet the standard of care in patient selection by failing to recognize body dysmorphia in a patient and failing to select the appropriate operation for another patient. According to the board, Sturm was also alleged to have failed to meet the standard of care for consent by failing to obtain signed consent forms for certain procedures, and is alleged to have failed to adequately follow up with patients after surgery.

Board records indicate that Sturm, without admitting any wrongdoing, opted not to contest the charges and agreed to voluntarily surrender her license. She will be eligible to seek reinstatement of her license in two years.
The board’s action followed the initiation of three separate investigations into Sturm. Two of those board investigations originated in 2023 and one was launched in 2024.
In May 2024, the family of Angela Kettwig sued Sturm and Sturm Cosmetic Surgery in Story County District Court. According to the lawsuit, Sturm performed liposuction and an abdominoplasty on Kettwig in March 2023.
During the surgery, Sturm allegedly caused injuries to Kettwig that led to a massive hemorrhage, and Kettwig died from cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligence and loss of parental consortium.
Sturm denied any wrongdoing in the case, asserting that any injuries suffered by Kettwig were “caused by pre-existing conditions or acts which these answering defendants have no control.” A trial was scheduled for Feb. 10, 2026. However, on June 14, 2025, Sturm filed for bankruptcy. As a result, the Kettwig family’s malpractice lawsuit has been stayed by a Polk County judge while the bankruptcy case moves forward.
According to the bankruptcy court filings, Sturm’s gross personal income in 2023 was $269,000. She and her husband have claimed $5.9 million in assets and $5.3 million in liabilities.
Two malpractice lawsuits pending
Sturm is also being sued by another former patient, Joseph Kaissi, who claims he went to Sturm Cosmetic Surgery on Jan. 25, 2022, for a consultation and was immediately recommended for a surgical procedure to correct the separation of abdominal muscles. Two days later, Sturm performed the operation at Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.
The lawsuit claims the procedure was a “risky and unnecessary” operation, that Sturm failed to treat Kaissi’s hematoma and failed to exercise the appropriate degree of acceptable surgical technique. Kaissi alleges he sustained “serious and permanent injuries” as a result of the operation.
Sturm has denied any wrongdoing and asserted any injuries were caused by preexisting conditions or acts over which Sturm had no control. A jury trial is scheduled for Sept. 9, 2025.
Kaissi’s attorneys have asked that their case not be stayed by Sturm’s bankruptcy filing. They argue that Sturm’s liability is covered by an insurance policy with limits of up to $1 million per claim and an annual aggregate cap of $3 million. They are asking to proceed with their case with the understanding that any recovery will be limited to what the insurance company pays, ensuring none of Sturm’s debtors will be harmed by the payout.
Former employee suing Sturm
Sturm Cosmetic Surgery is also facing a lawsuit filed by a former employee and registered nurse, Tonya Becker. In her lawsuit, Becker claims she was responsible for assisting Sturm with cosmetic surgeries and overseeing patients’ post-anesthesia care at the Ames clinic.
The lawsuit alleges Sturm fired Becker in 2024, a year after hiring her, and that the dismissal was due to Becker “refusing to compromise patient safety, rejecting illegal and unethical directives, and standing up against a toxic work environment.”
Becker claims that while working at the clinic, she “discovered numerous unethical and inappropriate practices that jeopardized patient safety,” in part by falsely informing a patient she had performed treatments on both hips when, in fact, only the right hip was treated.
The lawsuit also alleges Sturm allowed scrub technicians to assist in closing patient incisions, despite the fact that they were not licensed to perform such tasks, and that discarding expired medication was against the clinic’s policy as it was considered wasteful.
In early 2024, the lawsuit claims, the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services performed a nonpunitive site visit, as requested by the clinic, to examine infection control procedures. The lawsuit alleges DHHS identified several deficiencies that were then “brushed off” by clinic management as unimportant.
In an April 2024 staff meeting, Sturm allegedly cried and stated that she had to personally cover the $17,000 cost of discarding expired medications and blamed the staff for being wasteful by discarding the drugs.
In addition to claiming wrongful termination and age discrimination, Becker is also suing Sturm for sexual harassment, alleging that in 2023 Sturm instructed a colleague to purchase a “rainbow-tail dildo.” Sturm gave the device to a nurse during a staff meeting and workers later made lewd jokes about it, even while patients were under anesthesia for surgical procedures, the lawsuit claims.
In a January 2024 surgical meeting with Sturm, the lawsuit alleges, a scrub tech showed the entire team a Reddit video of a male doctor masturbating. “The group laughed and commented on the size of (the doctor’s) penis,” the lawsuit claims.
On other occasions, a scrub tech allegedly exposed her breasts during a surgical meeting after a colleague commented on her bra and, in a hallway, lifted her skirt and exposed herself while colleagues danced and chanted.
Sturm and the clinic have denied any wrongdoing. A jury trial is scheduled Sept. 29, 2026. Although the case was initially stayed due to Sturm’s bankruptcy filing, the case is now proceeding with only the clinic named as a defendant.

CHICAGO — Illinois students won’t need to fill out applications for most state universities to be admitted — if they have high enough grades.

With his signature, Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday approved a bill creating the direct admissions program. Along with it, he approved bills that implement new state standards for programs offering college credits to high school students, and new requirements for financial aid application assistance.

“These bills streamline the application process for college-bound seniors in Illinois, enhance support for applicants, and open up new horizons for prospective students,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Enacting these laws is what all government work should be about — making life easier for our people.”

Pritzker had said college admissions and higher education accessibility would be a priority of his during this year’s legislative season, which ended May 31. But one of his signature initiatives — allowing community colleges to offer four-year degrees — failed earlier this year.

Direct college admissions

Illinois will implement a direct admissions program so that students hoping to go to a state school will be automatically admitted — if they have a high enough grade point average.

“For eligible seniors and community college transfer students, you will receive offers from the schools that you are admitted to without raising a finger. That’s huge,” Sen. Christopher Belt, D-Swansea, said. “It takes away the anxiety, it takes away the angst of that whole process.”

The bill outlining the direct admissions program, House Bill 3522, passed unanimously in the Senate and with broad bipartisan support in the House in late May.

The program will begin in the 2027-28 school year, with nine of the state’s 11 public universities participating:


University of Illinois Springfield
Southern Illinois University
Chicago State University
Eastern Illinois University
Governors State University
Illinois State University
Northeastern Illinois University
Northern Illinois University
Western Illinois University


High school students and community college students hoping to transfer to a state school must opt-in to the program to receive offers. Community colleges already admit all students interested in attending but will still participate in the direct admissions program.

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and University of Illinois Chicago will not participate in the direct admission program. The state will, however, provide information about traditional applications to qualifying students through an “access and outreach campaign.”

The criteria for the direct admissions program and outreach campaign will be set by individual schools.

“This new, statewide direct admissions program will make a college degree more accessible for students and will motivate them to continue in their life-changing college journey by ensuring them a spot at their community college or at one of the state's public universities,” Illinois Board of Higher Education Executive Director Ginger Ostro said in a Monday statement.

Financial aid application assistance

Two more bills signed by Pritzker on Monday, House Bills 3096 and 3097, aim to make it easier for students to navigate the financial aid process.

HB 3096 requires high schools in Illinois to designate at least one staff member as a point-of-contact for information about the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. HB 3097 requires high schools to offer students time during the school day to fill out FAFSA forms and to receive assistance in doing so.

The new requirements go into effect in the 2025-26 school year.

Information collected through FAFSA is used to determine eligibility for federal loans. Many schools use FAFSA for their own aid programs, and the state offers need-based grants based on information submitted through FAFSA.

“As a father of college students, I just currently went through this fun exercise with my daughter filling out a FAFSA form,” Sen. Javier Cervantes, D-Chicago, said. “I’m being a little sarcastic calling it fun because we had deadlines, we had to make sure we had our documentation together and it wasn’t easy.”

From the 2010 to 2020 school years, an average of 86% of first-time students at four-year schools and 78% of first-time students at two-year schools received federal financial aid, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Dual credit program
House Bill 2967, another bill approved by Pritzker on Monday, outlines new requirements for high schools and community colleges offering “dual credit” programs, through which students earn high school and college credit for completing a single course.

It requires teachers teaching dual credit classes to have a master’s degree in the subject they’re teaching or a master’s degree and some graduate coursework in the subject. It also requires high schools and community colleges to designate individuals responsible for negotiating what individual dual credit agreements look like.

“HB 2967 reinforces the vital role that strong, robust partnerships between community colleges and high schools play in delivering high quality dual credit programs,” Illinois Community College Board Executive Director Brian Durham said in a statement. “These programs help students get a head start on their college education and a path towards career success.”

The bill also requires schools to consider in-state colleges and universities when setting up dual credit programs over out-of-state institutions.

The bill also creates a committee made up of education officials, representatives from two different statewide teachers’ unions and others to work on improving dual credit programs’ accessibility and quality, as updating a template used by school districts to develop dual credit agreements with community colleges.

Four-year degrees at community college

One key proposal didn’t make the cut this spring — a measure allowing community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees. Despite being backed by Pritzker in his State of the State address earlier this year, it faced pushback in the General Assembly, which did not pass a bill implementing the policy.

That proposal drew concerns from some lawmakers who worried it could undercut programs to attract local students to state universities. In particular, some lawmakers worried that it could hurt schools like Northeastern Illinois University and Chicago State University, which serve largely minority student populations.

But Pritzker on Monday said he would continue working on a proposal to allow more schools to offer bachelor’s degrees in “very specific, niche areas” like nursing and advanced manufacturing.

“You sometimes have to work two, four, six years, maybe longer to get something done,” Pritzker said.

The Supreme Court has ruled on a previous case in favor of upholding the California law, which opponents argue puts an unfair burden on pork producers by impacting their ability to sell to the state. 
The IPPA lawsuit argued Proposition 12, which voters approved in 2018, imposed excessive burdens on interstate commerce and discriminated against out-of-state farmers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The case was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled in June 2024, in favor of California. IPPA filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision, which is the petition the court denied Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led more than 20 attorneys general from other ag-producing states on an amici curiae in support of the IPPA appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Bird said in a statement Monday she was disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision. 
“Laws like this hurt Iowa’s rural communities and make it more difficult for Americans to enjoy the world-class pork products they have come to love and expect out of our state,” Bird said. 
Bird said she would continue to fight against similar laws, including a Massachusetts law against which the attorney general also led an amici curiae with other states, urging for an appeal. 
“States like California and Massachusetts should not dictate Iowa farming practices,” Bird said. 
The California law, which went into effect in 2024, stipulates that regardless of where an animal was raised, it must comply with the state regulation on animal confinement in order to be sold in California. The law stipulates sow enclosures must have at least 24 square feet of room. The law, which passed as a state referendum, was supported by animal rights organizations that say this spacing would give the animals enough space to turn around freely. 
The west-coast state is a major pork consumer, meaning its laws have a big impact on pork production across the country and in states like Iowa, which produces the most pork in the nation. 
Pork producers said the law would disrupt the pork supply chain and raise costs at the consumer level, as producers retrofit their facilities to comply with the law. 
Eldon McAfee, counsel for IPPA, said the organization was “disappointed, obviously” by the decision and that many pork producers “don’t understand” how a California law “can be enforced here in Iowa.” 
McAfee said producers believe this should be a marketplace decision driven by consumer and producer choice, not an enforcement. 
“We do not believe it can be mandated by law, we believe it is unconstitutional,” McAfee said. “But the court disagreed in the NPPC case and declined to accept this case.” 
McAfee referenced a Supreme Court decision against the National Pork Producers Council’s petition of the California law. 
He said while the court did not issue an explanation of the decision, the docket entries show justices discussed the case seven times before eventually declining the petition, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh dissenting. 
McAfee said the next step forward is legislative action. 
“The courts have stated the basic premise that it is the federal government, Congress, that regulates interstate commerce,” McAfee said. “We believe the best option is federal legislation … to prevent this type of law.” 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, a Republican from Iowa, has also been a vocal opponent of Proposition 12, working with other Republicans in Iowa and other states to advance legislation the past several years that would supersede the state law. 
“This mandate on Iowa hog farmers increases pork prices for families, makes hog farming needlessly more expensive, harms our rural communities, and threatens our food security,” Feenstra said in a statement Monday. “I remain committed to getting a new, five-year Farm Bill signed into law that repeals Prop 12 and delivers certainty and clarity for our hog farmers.”

It passed after a  “full-caliber collaborative effort,” Landry wrote to Miguez. McMath’s bill also goes “further downrange,” Landry said, while Miguez’s bill “leaves some harmful ingredients in the chamber.” 
McMath’s bill also “loads the health initiative with a broader scope,” and requires medical professionals to “reload their knowledge,” Landry continued. 
Landry also wrote that Miguez’s bill seems “like a misfire.” 
“In short, these two bills fire at some of the same targets, but SB 14 is a well-aimed tool that will Make Louisiana Healthy Again,” Landry wrote. 
Miguez has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Both bills are part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemicals in foods that Kennedy has targeted for elimination. 
While Miguez and Landry are largely ideologically aligned, the two have clashed in recent months since Miguez criticized Landry’s tax reform package.

Medicaid was their salvation.The front-page headlines in the last few days have been jarring: “Medicaid Cuts May Force Retirees out of Nursing Homes.”
While much of the battle over Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax breaks for billionaires is theoretical to many of us who’ve always had health insurance and coverage for things like rehab and even nursing homes, this information hit home for me. 
In 1999, over Labor Day weekend, my mother had a paralytic stroke that left her entire right side lifeless. Although her mind was unimpaired, most of what she cared about in life was deeply affected. Since early childhood she had been a pianist, eventually a very fine one trained at the University of Louisville. Her days at the keyboard were ended. So was her ability to walk, to take care of basic chores, even to bathe. So was her ability to spend time with her grandchildren, and to entertain the family for holidays.
Yet her heart, at age 75, was still strong and her will to live was, at least for a time, unflinching. But within six months or so, after long treatment in a rehab center, Medicare required that she go home or go on full pay.  
My parents lived the American dream in the postwar era. They were comfortably off, owned their own home, and educated their two sons — with no student loans. But even in 1999, they couldn’t afford, for very long, the steep prices that nursing homes charged. So Mother came home in a wheelchair, where she remained under my aged father’s care until he could bear it no longer. The family housekeeper, who had cared for my grandmother until she died, was as old as Mother, so she wasn’t up to the task either. 
One night in April 2000 the call came from my brother that my father was so ill that he was unable to rise from the living room sofa. Within an hour, he was in an emergency room, dying of congestive heart failure. 
He was brought back to life by one of Louisville’s great cardiac surgeons, Morris Weiss, but for the rest of his life he was frail and dependent on medicine, walked with a cane, and was unable to take my mother back home. Alas, nursing home care was the only option for her,
My father was always very private about his finances, so I never quite knew when, but his savings (and Mother’s) dried up and she was transferred to Medicaid. He was even reluctant to speak of it. We all thought Medicaid was for indigents, or the terribly disabled. 
 Turns out, Medicaid was for us. I learned that a lot of nursing homes welcomed Medicaid residents. An attorney who specialized in issues involving the aged advised our family. Then an elderly aunt died and left Mother some money. Immediately she went back onto private pay until those dollars were gobbled up. So back on Medicaid she went. 
Meanwhile Daddy sold our family home, which gave him some money for emergencies but very few pleasures. He moved into a nice senior citizens’ complex, designed for independent living, with group meals and activities. He made friends and played cards and was close enough to Mother’s nursing home to pay daily visits. Then, his health began to fail.
For a time there was a very real prospect that both of them would be in nursing homes at the same time. Then, in the spring of 2008, each began a further decline. Mother decided that enough was enough. She told me and my Aunt Rose, “I want to die.” And so she did, by declining food and medication. She ended her days in a palliative care unit in St. Matthews, only a few blocks from where she had lived the happiest days of her life. In retrospect, I think she died of a broken heart.
A month later, her older sister Lucille died at the ripe old age of 91, in her own home surrounded by loved ones. And then, just after July 4, my father joined them, passing from life in the very same corridor as my mother, attended by the same nurses. It was a blessing.
It is too painful for me to imagine what would have happened if Mother had been thrown out of the nursing home for inability to pay. “Tax reform” – Donald Trump-style – might well make that happen. It is despicable legislation, the product of a time when lowering taxes for the rich “trumps” caring for the people who made this country great through hard work and patriotism. I don’t think my father went to fight in World War II to save a nation where the super-rich call the shots.
If this is a “big, beautiful bill” in the eyes of some, to me, it is a cancer in the American soul.

Investigators who’ve looked into the robocalls across Michigan, Ohio and New York found that Burkman and Wohl were responsible for about 85,000 robocalls before the 2020 election, which attempted to discourage voters of color from participating.
In Michigan, Burkman and Wohl each face four felony charges for voter intimidation and other violations to state election law.
Michigan’s Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel filed charges against Burkman and Wohl in 2020 with her office reporting the pair made thousands of calls to communities of color including 12,000 calls to residents with a 313 area code, the area code for Detroit, a predominantly Black city.
According to Nessel’s office, the calls spread false and intimidating information to voters including that voting by mail could lead to police departments using their information to find people with outstanding warrants or allow credit card companies to collect outstanding debts.

It’s been almost five years since Nessel filed criminal charges against Burkman and Wohl and in a news release Monday, she said she’s ready for the case to proceed and the state’s highest court’s decision on Friday to not hear the pair’s appeal will help the case reach an end.
“I am pleased that the Michigan Supreme Court refused to entertain further delay tactics by denying to hear this appeal,” Nessel said in the news release. “Voter intimidation is a direct attack on the fundamental right to vote, and I look forward to finally bringing this matter to trial.” 
In New York, Burkman and Wohl reached a settlement with the state’s attorney general’s office in 2024 to pay up to $1.25 million targeting thousands of Black voters in New York during the 2020 election. 
In Ohio, Burkman and Wohl were ordered by a court in 2022 to spend 500 hours registering people to vote after prosecutors said the men organized more than 3,000 robocalls to Cleveland-area residents, according to The Associated Press.

Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, pictured Jan. 13 speaking at a press conference, is the author of a bill that created the Oklahoma National Guard CareerTech Assistance Program. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma National Guard members may be eligible for tuition assistance to pay for CareerTech programs, but lawmakers did not allocate funding to pay for the program in its first budget year. 
Senate Bill 31, authored by Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, created the Oklahoma National Guard CareerTech Assistance Program to provide up to three years of assistance to eligible Guard members who enroll in a technology center school. 
While program availability is subject to funding, no funding was allocated by the state Legislature this session while the program continues to be built out. 
The measure’s House author, Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, said funding was not an immediate necessity for the program. It could take from six to eight months for the Oklahoma National Guard and CareerTech to work out the details of the program and application, he said. 
The bill created an account specifically for the program at the Oklahoma Treasury, so the military is able to allocate money to it but legislative conversations about funding it could continue next session, Strom said. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma National Guard said the program is subject to the availability of funding, but is prepared to move forward with it once money is allocated.
The budget impact is dependent on participation, but the average tuition and fees amount per student is $2,170, according to a Senate Fiscal report. 
The measure became law in May without the signature of Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Hicks praised the bipartisan support for her bill in a statement. The House voted 78-5 to pass the measure and the Senate passed it unanimously. 
“Our Oklahoma National Guard members are a critical part of our national defense, and in times of natural disaster here at home, assist our local emergency personnel and first responders in helping their friends and neighbors,” Hicks said. “Extending this education benefit to our guard members is a recognition of their service and sacrifice that will help further their success, in uniform and civilian life.”
Hicks on Monday referred questions about the program’s funding to Strom.
Eligibility is limited to members of the National Guard who have at least one year left on their enlistment contract and agree to complete it. They must also agree to 24 months of active service after completing their last semester they received assistance for. 
Those receiving assistance are required to maintain a 2.0 GPA, continue participation in the Guard and have a Military Occupational Specialty or Air Force Specialty Code after their first semester. 
“We are proud to support Oklahomans who serve our country through the National Guard, and we’re grateful the state is investing in their future through CareerTech tuition assistance,” said CareerTech Director Brett Haken in a statement. “This legislation recognizes the value of high-skill, high-demand training and helps ensure that those who serve are equipped with the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. It’s a win for our service members, a win for our employers, and a win for Oklahoma’s economy.”
Failure to comply with the eligibility requirements means a Guard member must repay the amount of the assistance given. Before seeking assistance through this program, a Guard member must also apply for federal grants and scholarships.

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000. South Carolina’s rate of 9.9 per 100,000 people is in roughly the middle.



“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

“These audit findings, based on sample testing of a much larger population of billions of dollars in transactions, are a sober reminder that we’ve got to do better,” State Auditor Mike Foley said Monday in a statement.
A 30-page letter sent to 15 state agencies identified concerns such as: alleged fraud from Workers’ Compensation Court benefits; excessive personal vehicle mileage; and improper reimbursement for tuition, bonuses and moving expenses.
 ‘Simple search’ 

The auditing team cited specific examples in the report made public Monday. Among them:
The Worker’s Compensation Court allegedly sent inappropriate payments totaling $18,900 to the account of a former public employee who died last year, auditors noted after comparing state payments to death records. A daughter’s alleged use of the monthly benefit payments raised possible violations of state law, the report said.
The daughter appeared confused about the situation, according to the audit team. The Workers’ Compensation Court said it recovered the full overpayment amount soon after the problem was uncovered and is working to improve procedures and death confirmations.
Similarly, the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems reportedly made a retirement payment of nearly $2,900 to someone who had died.
And the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services paid two deceased individuals $1,500 each from a workforce stabilization grant funded from American Rescue Plan Act funds, the report said.
DHHS had not been aware of the deaths, according to the audit team, but quickly began a process to recoup the funds. Foley noted that a “simple search” of the department’s vital records database was readily available.
A review of tuition reimbursement benefits for state employees uncovered as much as $122,431 that should have been repaid because the state employee left their post before a specified time period, Foley said.
  Tuition reimbursement for employees who didn’t stay in jobs long enough was cited as a concern in an auditor’s report Monday.  (Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)
The situation arose in at least four state agencies, according to the audit team, which reviewed back to 2022. In the Department of Correctional Services, for example, 24 workers left jobs within one year of completing higher education coursework, costing taxpayers as much as $67,843 in tuition subsidies that weren’t paid back, Foley said. 
For Health and Human Services, over a three-year period, Foley said that 29 employees reportedly left state service within a year of receiving $49,002 in total tuition subsidies without repayment.
The audit team noted that the Corrections policy allows an employee up to $10,000 each fiscal year in tuition reimbursements. Auditors reported that one employee was reimbursed a total of $11,286 for courses in a fiscal year, an alleged overpayment of $1,286.
Inconsistent policies 
Tuition reimbursement is inconsistent among state agencies. Certain department policies state that employees “may” be required to reimburse if they leave employment within a certain amount of time. DHHS said repayment request had not been a recent practice, and said that it would investigate options going forward. The Nebraska Supreme Court said it had actively sought repayment, but as of last July suspended the benefit.
A Corrections manager said the agency had not actively been seeking repayment, though Foley noted it was required under the agency’s policy during the period reviewed. The agency told auditors it would update its policy to require repayment with a warning that noncompliance would be recorded in a personnel file.
When it came to hiring and retention incentives, the auditing team alleged that four state agencies potentially overpaid a total of $17,000 to former employees who did not fulfill requirements. The review went back to July 2023.
Additionally, Foley said, auditors reviewed 20 Nebraska Department of Transportation recruits who received reimbursement for moving expenses but left their jobs within a year. That review went back to 2020. Of those, 17 did not repay as required and the auditor estimated the lost amount at $13,828. 
Transportation managers told the audit team, led by manager Dakota Christensen, that it has since taken steps to reinforce compliance.

In another situation, Foley called it “a gross inefficiency” that an inspector with the Nebraska Brand Committee was reimbursed $92,789 for personal vehicle mileage over 3.5 years. Inspectors oversee and regulate cattle branding in the state. Foley contends that such high mileage costs could be reduced with the assignment of a state vehicle. 
 The little things 

Foley said “a lot of little things” add up to government inefficiencies and should be a focus along with larger budget cuts.
“The goal of minimizing the cost of government services can be achieved only if every public employee maintains an attitude of respect for the hard-working Nebraska citizens whose taxes pay our salaries,” Foley said.
The 15 agencies who received the auditor’s letter: Attorney General’s Office; Nebraska Supreme Court; Workers’ Compensation Court; Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems; Brand Committee; Tax Equalization and Review Commission; Legislative Council; Corn Board; Real Estate Commission and the Departments of Health and Human Services; Environmental and Energy; Correctional Services; Transportation; Veterans’ Affairs, and Administrative Services.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline)A controversial provision to sell off federal public land, including in Washington state, has been removed from the Republican tax cut and spending bill now under consideration in the U.S. Senate. 
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a narrowed version of the proposal last week after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled his original plan, which would have made millions of acres eligible for sale, was out of order. 
Over the weekend, Lee said he was preemptively withdrawing the slimmed-down version, which covered U.S. Bureau of Land Management property that met certain criteria. 
“Over the past several weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to members of the community, local leaders, and stakeholders across the country,” Lee said in a statement on social media. “While there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation – and in some cases, outright lies – about my bill, many people brought forward sincere concerns.” 
Lee said he chose to withdraw the land sale proposal because the constraints of the fast-track process being used to move the GOP budget legislation did not allow him to secure safeguards to guarantee land would be sold to “American families” rather than “foreign interests.” 
The senator’s proposals drew widespread criticism.
“This was a wrongheaded proposal that had no place in this reconciliation bill. Many western Senators who know the value of recreational lands objected to its inclusion,” U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash, said in a statement after Lee dropped his latest proposal. “I am glad our special places will still be available for everyone.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 20:37:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Feds unfreeze $137 million in Mississippi education money,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/feds-unfreeze-mississippi-education-money/,The decision comes less than three months after the federal government revoked billions nationwide as part of Trump administration efforts to cut government spending.,"The federal government is restoring $137 million in education funds to Mississippi schools.
The U.S. Department of Education notified states last week that it would reinstate pandemic relief funds. The decision comes less than three months after the federal government revoked billions nationwide as part of Trump administration efforts to cut government spending. 
State education agencies and school districts originally had until March 2026 to spend the money, but the federal government claimed that because the pandemic was over, they had no use for the money. 
That March 2026 deadline has been reinstated following a series of injunctive orders. 
A coalition of Democratic-led states sued the federal government in April over the decision to withhold the money. Then, a federal judge granted plaintiff states injunctive orders in the case, which meant those states could continue spending their COVID-relief dollars while other states remained restricted.
But the education department decided that wasn’t fair, wrote Secretary Linda McMahon in a letter dated June 26, so the agency was restoring the money to all states, not just the ones involved in the lawsuit. 
“The original intent of the policy announced on March 28 was to treat all states consistently with regards to safeguarding and refocusing their remaining COVID-era grant funding on students,” she wrote. “The ongoing litigation has created basic fairness and uniformity problems.”
The Mississippi Department of Education notified school districts about the decision on Friday. 
In the meantime, schools and states have been requesting exemptions for individual projects, though many from across the country have been denied. 
Eleven Mississippi school districts had submitted requests to use the money to fund services such as tutoring and counseling, according to records requested by Mississippi Today, though those are now void because of the federal government’s decision. 
Starting immediately, school districts can submit new requests to the state education department to have their federal allocation reinstated.
Mississippi Today previously reported that about 70 school districts were relying on the federal funds to pay for a range of initiatives, including construction projects, mental health services and literacy programs. 
In 2023, almost half of Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds, pandemic relief money allocated to schools across the country, went to students’ academic, social, and emotional needs. A third went to operational and staff costs, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education.
Though Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann previously said that legislative leaders might consider helping agencies that were impacted by federal funding cuts, House Speaker Jason White said Monday that he did not have an appetite for directing state funds to pandemic-era programs. 
Small school districts were already feeling the impact of the federal government’s decision to rescind the money. In May, Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School Board voted to terminate a contract on a school construction project funded with federal dollars. 
The litigation is ongoing, so the funding could again be rescinded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05004024/Eastside-Elementary-1.jpg,,,2025-06-30 17:13:02.934962

The hike is the most prominent piece of a six-year, $3.2 billion package passed by the Washington Legislature and signed by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this year.
Lawmakers turned to the tax to contend with a projected $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year transportation budget. Officials said this was caused by an inflation-fueled surge in construction costs and flattening gas tax receipts as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and as cars have become more fuel efficient.
“This will keep projects on track and ensure the promises we’ve made can be kept,” said state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “As you drive around and see those orange cones, that’s where your money is at work.”
Tuesday’s increase will push the state’s per-gallon tax rate on gas and other vehicle fuels from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. Starting July 1, 2026, it will rise each year by 2% — about a penny annually — to account for inflation.
Also Tuesday, the state tax on diesel will climb an additional 3 cents, so 9 cents total, to 58.4 cents, then go up another 3 cents two years later. That additional 6 cents applied to diesel will be subject to a 2% boost each year starting July 1, 2028.

 Only California, Pennsylvania will have higher state gas taxes than Washington

Washington will have the nation’s third-highest state gas tax behind California and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is currently at 52.4 cents, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
Washington’s state tax is on top of federal fuel taxes, which are 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel.
Hiking the gas tax is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax is counted on to bring in $166 million over that time.
These increases are two of the larger entrees in the transportation package’s smorgasbord of new taxes and higher fees.
Under the legislation, passenger vehicle weight fees are going up a few dollars. The added sales tax for vehicles will climb from 0.3% to 0.5%.
There’s also a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000 and a 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000.
There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax as well, from 5.9% to 11.9%, before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
And there’s more.
The tire disposal fee will go from $1 apiece to $5 apiece. Washington State Ferries will boost its vessel replacement surcharge by 50 cents in October and start imposing a 3% fee for those who pay with credit cards next year.
This week’s increase in gas and diesel taxes may not be immediately noticeable.
The state collects those taxes before fuel gets pumped. They are paid by the distributor — the business that buys or imports gasoline and transports it to the neighborhood gas station. Distributors will decide how they pass their costs onto the station owner, who must decide if they will pass on any added costs to customers.
Washington created a motor vehicle fuel tax in 1921. It applied to special fuels, too, according to the state Department of Licensing.
The last gas tax boost totaled 11.9 cents and anchored the Connecting Washington transportation package passed by the Legislature in 2015. It led to increases of 7 cents per gallon in July 2015 and 4.9 cents a year later.
Washington gas prices are higher now than a year ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.45 on Friday compared to $4.33 in 2024, according to AAA. Nationally, the average price was $3.20 on Friday.
Critics of the state’s Climate Commitment Act, which requires refineries and other businesses to pay for their air pollution, say that law has pushed up gas prices in recent years.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Rhode Island’s plan to bring in more offshore wind power appears at risk of washing away after a fourth delay to a scheduled contract signing with a project developer.
Caroline Pretyman, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed in an email Monday that the utility provider has again extended negotiations with SouthCoast Wind, citing uncertainty over federal legislation affecting offshore wind projects. The news comes the same day the two parties were set to ink an agreement locking in commitments and pricing for Rhode Island to buy 200 megawatts of wind-powered electricity from the project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
And, it’s less than a month before a public hearing on the proposed cable burial plan for the wind turbines, which requires state regulatory approval to cross Aquidneck Island. 
A new schedule posted to Rhode Island Energy’s offshore wind procurement website Monday afternoon sets a new deadline of Nov. 1 to finalize a contract, with an important caveat.
“Rhode Island Energy may terminate the project’s conditional selection if negotiations are not successful prior to this date,” the company states in the update. It’s the first time the utility supplier has acknowledged the possibility that the tentative agreement might be canceled.
Pretyman said additional details were not available Monday. 
But the ongoing uncertainty is hardly a surprise given the current climate in D.C.
President Donald Trump made good on his anti-wind campaign promises the day he took office, with a first-day executive order halting new offshore wind leases. SouthCoast Wind already secured the bulk of the federal approvals prior to the change in administration. But the project is now facing delays in securing the last three federal permits needed to move forward, Michael Brown, CEO for Ocean Winds, the project’s parent company, said in a June 10 affidavit included in a legal challenge to the administration over its wind directives.
The federal agencies reviewing the permit applications cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo as the reason for delays, Brown said in the affidavit. He specifically mentioned pending agreements with Rhode Island and Massachusetts utility providers were at risk.
“Without clarity on when or how issues arising under the Presidential Memorandum will be resolved, it may be impossible for the parties to execute the PPAs,” Brown wrote.










Rhode Island Energy may terminate the project’s conditional selection if negotiations are not successful prior to this date.


– Update posted to Rhode Island Energy’s offshore wind procurement website 


Brown’s written testimony is part of a lawsuit led by 17 state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, seeking to stop the Trump administration from halting the offshore wind sector. The lawsuit continues to play out in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, with a Sept. 4 hearing on whether a federal judge should issue a ruling in the case, according to the court docket.
Brown said Monday resolving the dispute over Trump’s offshore wind memo was “critical” to the future of the company’s project.
“It is critical that the special review called for by the Presidential Memorandum be resolved as soon as possible to ensure that regulatory instability does not jeopardize the viability of large infrastructure projects like SouthCoast Wind,” Brown said. “We are grateful for the continued collaboration with our Massachusetts and Rhode Island partners.”
The cost of walking away
SouthCoast has already invested more than $600 million over the last seven years in developing, permitting, engineering and other preparations related to its project, according to court filings. Walking away now means giving up that investment, as well as the expected profits from selling power.
Meanwhile, Rhode Island’s foothold in the still-nascent offshore wind sector, as well as its ability to meet mandated decarbonization benchmarks, rests upon buying more offshore wind power.
A single offshore wind project like the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project under construction south of Block Island, can offset over 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year — just shy of 10% of the gross greenhouse gas emissions tracked from Rhode Island in 2022. 
The 200 megawatts of additional “nameplate capacity” from SouthCoast would provide enough electricity to power another 125,000 homes in the Ocean State, and even more — 1.4 million homes — in Massachusetts, based on its tentative agreement to buy the remaining 1,087 megawatts of power from the project.
Massachusetts utility providers have also pushed back the deadline to finalize a contract with the project developers to no later than Dec. 31, Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources said in an email Monday.
If approved, power contracts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts would also need to be reviewed and approved by their respective state utility regulators, who have final authority over long-term renewable energy contracts. Rhode Island’s newly revised schedule sets a Dec. 31 deadline for a final contract and price agreement to be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission. Previously, the contract was scheduled to be submitted to utility regulators by Aug. 25, based on a June 30 finalization.
Meanwhile, a separate state regulatory body, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board, is forging ahead with its own, independent review of the project’s cable burial plan. A public hearing on July 23 at Portsmouth Middle School will offer the chance for in-person input on the plan to run underwater power lines up the Sakonnet River, cross the northern end of Portsmouth and extend out into Mount Hope Bay.

Meeting state decarbonization mandates
Despite setbacks, advocates remained bullish on the need to grow Rhode Island’s renewable energy portfolio, including through offshore wind. 
A consortium of state agencies charged with planning how to meet the state’s mandated decarbonization benchmarks under the 2021 Act on Climate Law is expected to release a detailed report on next steps by the end of the year. Meanwhile, a five-member Senate study panel created in the 2025 legislative session will soon begin its own, complementary review of the Act on Climate law, with a report due in May 2026.
Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat who sponsored the resolution to create the study commission, said the intent is not to water down the existing state emissions reduction mandates, but to determine how to meet them.
“If you look at the way our emissions reduction strategy was set up, it involves a lot of switching over from fossil fuels to electricity, and to have that electricity come from renewable sources,” Zurier said in an interview Monday. “With that said, there are different ways to accomplish that.”
Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, was also undeterred by the latest setback in SouthCoast wind contract negotiations.
“Delays can be frustrating, but the end result — a union-built, decarbonized economy — will be worth it,” Crowley said in a text message.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office referred inquiries for comment to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.
“We continue to monitor the potential outcomes and changes to federal renewable energy laws and tax credits being discussed within the reconciliation legislation in Washington,” Robert Beadle, a spokesperson for the state energy office, said in an email.

DemasA ballot initiative is in the works to ban corporations with large existing or pending government contracts from making political contributions to candidates for office and sitting lawmakers.
Taking Back Our Power, a coalition backing the initiative, announced Monday its plans to get language approved for signature collection. The aim is to get the proposal before voters on the 2026 general election ballot.
Michigan law currently allows powerful monopolies and large government contractors, like DTE Energy, Consumers Energy and insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, to gain political influence via campaign and political action committee contributions, which can often evade public transparency and accountability, the group said Monday.
That’s where Michiganders for Money Out of Politics aims to make a difference. The ballot committee backed by Taking Back Our Power says it seeks to restore Michigan’s democratic systems by putting people over corporate profits.
The coalition consists of Michigan advocacy groups like Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Emergent Justice, Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians. 
The latter group was instrumental in helping create the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, which put state legislative and congressional redistricting in the hands of an independent, citizen-led commission instead of the Michigan Legislature.
The goal of Taking Back Our Power is to get the language and the summary before the Michigan Board of State Canvassers in July for approval to start collecting signatures.
Members of the group held a virtual news conference on Monday afternoon to extol the necessity of the measure.
Sean McBrearty, the state director of Clean Water Action, said that the corrosive influence of corporate money on state politics drowns out the voices of Michigan residents.
“The worst examples of this influence come when corporations that are reliant on government support and intervention for their profits, namely monopoly utilities and government contractors, spend huge amounts of money ensuring that they have the support of lawmakers who are supposed to be voting in the best interests of their constituents,” McBrearty said.
  Sean McBrearty of Clean Water Action at the Huron River in Milford, Aug. 10, 2022 | Kyle Davidson
For example, McBrearty said that in 2022, DTE gave money to 138 out of the 148 state House representatives and state Senators in Lansing. In 2023, he said DTE gave $100,000 to a nonprofit tied to former House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) while DTE residents were without power in the midst of winter storms.
“Unsurprisingly, a huge grassroots push for greater utility accountability fell on deaf ears in Lansing after that contribution,” McBrearty said.
Tate, who is running for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, has yet to respond to a request by Michigan Advance for comment on McBrearty’s statement.
Taking Back Our Power attempted over the last two years to address DTE’s and Consumers’ political contributions via legislation. Bills were introduced last term and were reintroduced this term. Despite broad bipartisan support, the bills weren’t given a hearing last term.
McBrearty, the vice chair of the new ballot committee, noted that state Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), who aligns ideologically with Democratic Socialists, and state Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton), a deeply conservative member of the Michigan House Freedom Caucus, led the way on that legislation. They both have endorsed the campaign to prevent monopolies like DTE and Consumers Energy from having an outsized influence over state politics.
DeSana is the only Republican noted on a list shared by the group that details which legislators have pledged to support the effort and what it’s trying to accomplish.
Getting dark money out of Lansing has been an uphill battle for those waging war against it, but some advances have been made in recent years, including the prosecutions surrounding the Unlock Michigan scandal.
Kim Murphy-Kovalick, programs director with Voters Not Politicians, said the committee will leverage grassroots power to get it across the finish line. The coalition’s individual member organizations have already started training volunteers and staff on the amendment and the rules of petition circulation. Public town hall events were soon to follow, she said.

Reporters asked Taking Back Our Power if they had received any response from DTE or Consumers on the matter. McBrearty said they had not and were not prioritizing those companies in terms of public outreach and feedback, adding that the group would instead stay focused on people and getting the message to them.
DTE told The Detroit News on Monday that it has complied with all corporate donation and political contribution laws.
The initiative is focused on utilities and other businesses with large government contracts in excess of $250,000. When asked why the ballot initiative was essentially stopping at utility companies, McBrearty said the group studied a list of state contractors when it was making its legislative moves. Concerns abounded during that work, McBrearty said, and led to the meat of the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics proposal. 
The $250,000 figure was chosen because Taking Back Our Power saw that the companies getting state contracts at less than $250,000 were largely service based, like lawn mowing. 
“Lawn mowing, laundry, cleaning, office buildings. … They’re not the people who are buying our government,” McBrearty said. “We want to stop the corrupt practices of corporations that are getting these huge contracts and the regulated utilities from buying our government, and so those who are getting smaller contracts are not the ones that we’re concerned about.”
Targeting a ban on political contributions from regulated monopolies was the path forward to start addressing dark money concerns because there was precedent for that, McBrearty added.
“Secondly, there’s a strong record of fact that the contributions of DTE, Consumers and others who fall into that category have a corrupting influence on the legislative process in Lansing,” he said. “I think this is definitely not a cure all for all the problems with campaign finance and with our democracy. This is … a major step forward that will make things more accountable and more representative of the people of Michigan in Lansing.”
Ranked choice voting initiative to start collecting signatures
While Michiganders for Money Out of Politics gets its wheels in motion, a ballot initiative to amend the Michigan Constitution for ranked choice voting during future elections was approved late last week by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers. The effort will soon start collecting signatures.
The petition form and a 100-word summary for the Rank MI Vote initiative were approved Friday. Rank MI Vote also wants to place the question on the 2026 ballot, which could see high turnout from voters. 
Under ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates from first to last. If no candidate receives a majority of first-place votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-place votes on those ballots are then distributed to the remaining candidates. That process continues until a candidate reaches a majority and is declared the winner. 
Michiganders in 2026 will elect a new governor, secretary of state, attorney general, U.S. Senator and decide who controls the state Senate.
The Rank MI Vote amendment aims to implement the voting system for most federal and state elections. To appear on the 2026 ballot, the committee will have to collect 446,198 valid signatures within a six-month window. Rank MI Vote in a statement said that it has begun distributing educational materials explaining ranked choice voting.
The group cited Pew Research Center data that shows 65% of U.S. voters reported dissatisfaction with the nation’s political climate. Rank MI Vote Executive Director Pat Zabawa said those feelings have helped elevate the ranked choice voting issue and has led to success thus far in volunteer recruitment.
“You’ve got nearly two in three voters saying they’re fed up with politics; they don’t need us to tell them that no one’s looking out for them anymore and political campaigns have become one scorched-earth ad blitz after another,” Zabawa said. “But their ears perk up when we explain how ranked choice voting changes political parties and candidates’ incentives, encouraging more positive, collegial, issues-focused campaigns. That message resonates strongly with just about everyone we talk to, and it’s starting to break through in a big way.” 
Ranked choice voting is currently allowed statewide in Alaska and Maine. Other states have ranked choice voting at the local level, like St. Paul, Minnesota, and several cities in the San Francisco Bay area, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The voting system had a national spotlight during last week’s New York City mayoral primary elections, which helped propel Democrat Zohran Mamdani to a presumed victory in a first round of voting on June 24.
Using ranked choice voting comes with the promise of electing a more diverse set of candidates, like Mamdani in New York, who pulled off a major upset by besting former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace.
“Trump and Slotkin both winning Michigan last year with fewer than half the votes moved the needle for a number of Michigan voters,” Zabawa said. “But when Mike Duggan declared his candidacy for governor as an independent, suddenly everyone’s speculating about the spoiler effect and which party Duggan will pull more votes from. People are really fired up about majority winners because it’s no longer some distant, theoretical possibility. It’s possible our next governor could win with less than 35% of the vote.”
Also approved on Friday was the Voters To Stop Pay Cuts ballot initiative, which seeks to upend Public Act 1 of 2025, which created a new minimum wage scheme after a long court battle over two 2018 initiative petitions that were adopted before they could go before voters and gutted by the Legislature in the same session. 
Public Act 1 set minimum wage $12.48 in 2025, $13.73 in 2026, and $15 an hour starting in 2026. The act also kept tipped wages intact and raised their percentage of hourly wage on a graduated scale up until 2030, much like it did with non-tipped workers’ minimum wage.
Voters to Stop Pay Cuts would like that law exorcised from statute, with referendum language arguing that Public Act 1 reduced the minimum wage for tipped workers and changed the way future inflation adjustments for minimum wage increases occurred in the future.
Canvassers gave the greenlight to Voters To Stop Pay Cuts’ petition form and summary on Friday.
 A ballot initiative that aims to add a 5% tax on the wealthiest Michigan residents for K-12 education also had its summary language approved on Friday but full approval of its petition form was tabled for the canvassers’ next meeting.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3478-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 17:13:02.934962

Tim Kaine, D-Va. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a series of amendments Monday to the Republican-led budget package moving through Congress, arguing the legislation would slash essential services and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. 
A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Kaine said his amendments are designed to blunt some of what he called the proposal’s “worst of the worst” provisions.
“We should be focused on growing and supporting the middle-class, not passing Donald Trump and congressional Republicans’ ‘Hurt People, Kill Jobs, and Spike the Debt to Reward the Rich Act,’” Kaine said in a statement. 
“I’m filing amendments to protect Americans from some of the worst of the worst from this Administration and its partisan megabill — from safeguarding our rural hospitals and preventing Americans from losing their health insurance, to keeping families from going hungry, standing up for our veterans, and preventing energy cost increases.”


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The 940-page proposal, which Republicans are advancing using a procedural maneuver that allows it to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate, would enact deep cuts to federal programs including Medicaid, food assistance, energy tax credits and emergency preparedness, while extending tax breaks for corporations and high-income earners.
Kaine’s amendments seek to address the legislation’s effects in Virginia and nationwide. Some of the proposed changes take direct aim at proposed spending cuts by reversing tax breaks for the wealthy and protecting funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
To protect health care access in rural parts of Virginia, Kaine proposed mitigating changes to the Medicaid provider tax program, which he warned could jeopardize the financial stability of community hospitals.
Veterans’ issues also feature prominently in Kaine’s response to the bill. He introduced an amendment to crack down on what he described as the Trump administration’s “mass firing of veterans from the federal workforce,” by requiring any such dismissals to be reported to Congress. Another measure would prohibit agencies from illegally firing federal employees or withholding congressionally appropriated funds.
Kaine’s proposals also address specific Virginia projects. 
One amendment would restore funding for the Richmond Water Treatment Plant, which was slated to receive a $12 million grant under the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. That grant, along with a $24 million allocation for upgrades to the Lake Meade Dam in Portsmouth, was canceled by the Trump administration, according to Kaine’s office.
Another amendment targets a provision that would authorize the transfer of the Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home at the National Air and Space Museum annex in Chantilly, Virginia, to Houston, Texas. Kaine argues the move would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions and restrict public access to the shuttle, which is currently available to view free of charge.
The budget bill’s energy provisions have drawn particular scrutiny from Kaine and outside advocacy groups. 
Several amendments filed by Kaine are aimed at preventing utility cost increases by blocking a proposed new excise tax on wind and solar power, and by preserving clean energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Kaine also filed an amendment to incorporate his bipartisan Jumpstarting Our Businesses By Supporting Students (JOBS) Act into the legislation. The proposal would allow federal Pell Grants to be used for shorter-term workforce training programs, a shift he says would help more Americans access good-paying jobs.
Other changes include reversing an estate tax cut for multimillionaires, aligning munitions procurement spending with NATO’s European Deterrence Initiative, protecting federal employee unions and requiring a full accounting of the bill’s fiscal impact to prevent budgetary sleight of hand.
Outside groups have also raised alarm over energy-related provisions in the latest version of the Trump-backed proposal, particularly changes made over the weekend as the Senate updated the legislative text for H.R. 1, now dubbed the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
According to Appalachian Voices, the bill would raise electricity prices and restrict renewable energy development by repealing production and investment tax credits for wind and solar projects, and imposing a new excise tax of up to 50% on those sources — but not on fossil fuels.
“This will be extremely harmful for small businesses, utilities, and nonprofits,” Appalachian Voices said in a statement. “It blocks new energy construction that can help meet growing demand, and punishes project owners for delays beyond their control.”
The updated language requires solar and wind projects already under construction to be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify for federal tax credits — a deadline advocates say ignores the reality of permitting delays.
Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on X, formerly Twitter, that the excise tax “will increase prices” and should be removed, calling it poor policy regardless of the energy source.
Labor groups also weighed in. North America’s Building Trades Unions — representing more than 3 million workers — said the bill “takes their jobs away and undermines” national energy goals. “Slashing energy tax credits and layering on harmful restrictions is no way to power America’s future,” the union said.
Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, called the changes “a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.” 
He warned that the move would “strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”
Kaine’s amendments are now part of a rapidly unfolding Senate process, as votes on the megabill are expected to take place this week. Whether any of the Virginia senator’s changes gain traction remains to be seen.

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law. It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Was that chicken cutlet grown in a lab? These states want you to know.

Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry. The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska and in enacting new laws this year; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that later died in the Senate.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents boosted salaries of state university presidents and the chancellor an average of 6.4%, despite the Legislature’s decision to provide no more than 2.5% raises to campus employees lagging the farthest behind market rates.
The Legislature earmarked $36.2 million to address state employee pay disparities in the new fiscal year starting July 1. These targeted increases would bring state workers up to 10% below market rate or enact raises of 2.5%, whichever was greater. Lawmakers left it to university administrators to fill other compensation gaps, but the reality was some campus employees won’t get a raise.
The Board of Regents awarded University of Kansas Chancellor Doug Girod a 12% surge of $105,000 to place his total compensation from state government and private endowment sources at $1 million per year.
After meeting in executive session, the Board of Regents also voted Friday without dissent to authorize a 7% increase for Fort Hays State University President Tisa Mason to take her annual package to $355,000. Kansas State University President Richard Linton, who received a 10.2% raise last year, was provided a 5% increase this year to elevate his compensation to $750,000.
The low end of the scale were 4% adjustments for Wichita State University President Rick Muma and Emporia State University President Ken Hush. Muma’s annual compensation climbed to $635,000, while Hush’s was bumped to $370,000. The Board of Regents recently hired a new president for Pittsburg State University, so no raise was adopted for PSU.
“Some of the most important actions we take concern our CEOs,” said Carl Ice, chairman of the Board of Regents. “Leaders matter. Leaders set a vision — visions that are compelling.”
Becky Pottebaum, director of finance and administration with the Board of Regents, said the annual review of compensation for university leaders was designed to make certain salaries were based on performance and competitive with peer institutions.
The latest salary adjustments reflected the Board of Regents’ adoption of new principles regarding CEO compensation.
“Strong leadership is essential to the continued success of our institutions and the broader mission of advancing higher education in Kansas,” she said.
For more than six months, state university leaders expressed alarm about converging financial challenges that included general operational inflation, softness in student enrollment, loss of federal research funding and new financial obligations to college athletes.
In response, the Board of Regents approved tuition increases averaging 3.9% for in-state undergraduate university students. University administrators have moved to impose cost-cutting measures to deal with anticipated budget deficits.
Girod said the “challenges largely are due to external factors such as disruptions to federal funding, the lack of new state funding, rising costs associated with facilities construction and operations, and the projected nationwide decline in college enrollment.”
He said without decisive action KU’s Lawrence campus could wind up with a $4 million shortfall by the end of the fiscal year.
“The reality is higher education is at a crossroads, and universities must develop new financial models for the new world we are in,” Girod said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Carl-Ice-regents-chairman-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

June 13, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Kentucky has a measles outbreak, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced Monday. 
It started in Woodford County and spread to nearby Fayette, the cabinet said days after announcing four new cases of the highly contagious virus in unvaccinated people. 
“When there are measles outbreaks in other states and nearby countries, it is not surprising to see spread to Kentucky,” Dr. Steven Stack, the public health commissioner and newly-appointed cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “Measles can be very serious, but it is avoidable through vaccination. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.” 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
Despite this, vaccinations have declined recently. 
“Results from the most recent school immunizations survey for the 2024-2025 school year indicate that only 86.9% of Kentucky kindergarteners are fully vaccinated against measles, which is lower than the national average of 93%. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school attendance in Kentucky,” the cabinet said. 
Meanwhile, the United States is facing its “largest outbreak” of measles since it “was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000,” the cabinet said.  
An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases, according to the CDC. 
As of June 24, 37 jurisdictions reported 1,227 confirmed measles cases to the CDC. 
In Kentucky, “health officials are working to identify people who may have been exposed,” the cabinet said. “There are currently five measles cases in Kentucky, four of which are connected to the same outbreak.” 
So far in 2025, the state has reported these measles cases:

In February, an adult was diagnosed with measles after traveling internationally. This was the first case in a Kentuckian since 2023. 
In March, an unvaccinated child traveling through Kentucky had measles. The child was treated and did not expose others. 
On June 27, the cabinet reported four new cases of measles in unvaccinated Kentuckians. Three of the four cases were from the same household in Woodford County. The fourth, unrelated to the others, is a Todd County person who was exposed while traveling internationally. 
On June 30, the cabinet announced that the “measles outbreak that started in Woodford County has spread to Fayette County.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana will get $412,000 in grant funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to remove lead pipes for schools and childcare facilities across the state.
The EPA announced in June that Louisiana is one of the states set to receive part of the $26 million dollars earmarked to replace lead pipes that can lead to a variety of health problems.
“More schools will be able to identify sources of lead in their water and take action,” said EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in a press release on June 13th. 
About 9 million water service lines in the country— the pipes that carry water from a public facility to houses, schools and businesses— have lead in their pipes, according to the most recent estimate from the EPA. Just over 140,000 of Louisiana’s service lines are estimated to have lead, along with the unknown status of 268,000 other service lines. 
Old pipes that contain lead can corrode over time depending on the chemistry of the water running through, eventually leading to the leaching of lead into drinking water.
Lead poisoning can be especially harmful to children. Even low levels of lead in the blood can cause serious health problems such as neurological problems, growth stunts and behavioral issues, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control. 
The CDC also cites children under 6 years old as especially vulnerable to these health hazards. Their bodies are in a phase of rapid development that could be particularly impacted by lead poisoning. Young children also have a tendency to put their hands in their mouths after grabbing items that may have lead, like old paint chips. 
Established by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law amended the 2016 voluntary lead contamination testing program for schools and childcare facilities to include funding to actually remove and replace sources of lead in drinking water.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8665-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

(Provided/Tri-County Technical College) COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s technical schools have more money to hire faculty and offer new classes as the state seeks to grow the number of high school juniors and seniors simultaneously enrolled in college courses.
Dual enrollment has grown to some 19,000 South Carolina high school students in the state since it started 20 years ago. SC Technical College System President Tim Hardee told the SC Daily Gazette he’d like to see that number rise to 25,000 within the next decade.
To spur the program along, legislators added $3 million annually (out of $5 million the technical system requested) to the new budget that starts Tuesday. That’s on top of the $10 million more annually added to the college system’s general operating budget, Hardee said.
The new funding will be split among South Carolina’s 16 technical colleges.
“There’s a market there, in partnership with the K-12 school districts, for us to grow our dual enrollment,” Hardee said. “That obviously won’t happen overnight, but we feel like the Legislature has invested in our technical colleges.”
High school students from both public and private schools can enroll in college classes which also count toward their high school diploma. This gives them a head start on an associate’s degree for in-demand fields, such as health care, manufacturing or welding. Or they can work ahead on freshman-level general education courses for those planning to attend a four-year university, often entering with a semester or more worth of college credit under their belt before ever stepping foot on campus.
More than 75% of these students receive scholarships to cover the cost of tuition. And at about half of the state’s 16 technical colleges, nearby K-12 school districts also pay for the textbooks students will need to complete the course, making it completely free, Hardee said.
Compare that to more than $27,000 annually for tuition, room and board at Clemson University, South Carolina’s most expensive public college, for South Carolina graduates before any scholarship aid, according to data from the state Commission on Higher Education. The in-state costs for Winthrop University and College of Charleston are both above $25,000. And at the University of South Carolina, it’s more than $24,000.
Dual enrollment courses help get students into the workforce faster or at least make a bachelor’s degree more affordable.
“Beyond just the financial affordability, it gives students an opportunity to experience a college course in a small classroom setting and really helps them to understand that they can be successful in college,” Hardee said.
Still, while 18% of the technical colleges’ student body are dual-enrolled high schoolers, the state is below the national average of 20%.
“We hope to be able to say, statewide, that dual enrollment courses are available for high school students with no cost to parents and their students,” Hardee previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
The best way to do that, Hardee said, is not to grow class sizes but to offer a wider range of classes.
Nearly 109,000 juniors and seniors attended South Carolina’s public high schools this past school year, according to the latest figures from the state Department of Education. About one-sixth of them are taking classes at the state’s technical colleges.
Trident Technical College has the largest number of dual-enrolled students — about 3,200. While the smallest program, Williamsburg Technical College, has just shy of 300 students. The 16 schools combined offer more than 850 courses.
The colleges will split the funds based on their total enrollment, Hardee said. The formula is weighted, however, to award more on a per pupil basis to rural colleges where it costs more per student to teach. Those colleges located in rural areas with a smaller tax base also tend to have less financial support from the counties and school districts they serve.
In those districts where students’ expenses aren’t totally covered, the technical colleges may choose to use their share of the state money to fill in the gap.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/students-at-tech.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

But she's faced criticism for CT's high electric costs and for deleted text messages.","Gov. Ned Lamont gave the state’s top utilities regulator, Marissa Gillett, another two years at the helm of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority on Monday, despite recent criticism over her transparency and Connecticut’s high electric costs. 
Gillett, 38, has led PURA since 2019 when she was chosen by Lamont. She previously worked as an advisor to the Maryland Public Service Commission and for an energy storage trade association.
Over the last few years, Gillett has developed an increasingly fraught relationship with the state’s two largest utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid, each of which own both electric and gas operations in Connecticut. Utility executives have accused Gillett of wielding excessive control over cases before regulators, and of making decisions that undermine the companies’ financial health and access to capital.
In April, Gillett’s nomination to a second, 4-year term as a member of PURA’s board was confirmed by lawmakers over the opposition of most Republicans. Her separate appointment as chair, however, is not subject to legislative review.
Lamont has consistently defended Gillett’s approach while singling out her background as a regulator, engineer and attorney who is willing to butt heads with the utilities.
“The utilities sometimes think she’s a little strong-willed, I understand that,” Lamont told reporters Monday, noting the companies have several pending lawsuits against Gillett and PURA.
“Let’s get this behind us so we can start working collaboratively,” the governor said.
In one of those lawsuits, brought by two gas companies owned by Avangrid, Gillett’s communications with two lawmakers who penned an op-ed harshly criticizing the utilities has become a point of contention. If Gillett helped to write the piece, the companies argue, it would reveal a bias that should have prevented her from ruling in cases that resulted in regulators cutting Avangrid’s gas rates by roughly $35 million.
Last week, an attorney for Gillett admitted in court that the chairwoman’s personal phone had automatically been set to delete text messages. That included messages with one of the authors of the op-ed.
Both Gillett and the authors of the op-ed have denied that she was involved in writing or editing the piece. A judge last week said he would allow attorneys for the utilities to question Gillett and her chief of staff under oath over whether she played any role in its creation.
In a statement released through a spokesperson Monday, Gillett said she was grateful to the governor for his continued support. 
“I look forward to working with my colleagues and the incredible PURA staff in furtherance of the important duties of the Authority,” Gillett said. 
Gillett’s critics, meanwhile, have latched on to the issue of her text messages to argue that she lacks transparency and has created needless controversies, all while electric rates in Connecticut remain some of the highest in the nation. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, panned the governor’s decision after he previously called for Gillett to resign.
“The Governor’s decision to reappoint Marissa Gillett as PURA Chair is as baffling as it is predictable,” Candelora said in statement. “She misled legislators and the public — and even deleted records subject to Freedom of Information laws. That alone should prompt bipartisan outrage and a hearing before the very legislators who confirmed her nomination.” 
In a statement Monday, Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said, “Our expectations are for a fair, transparent, balanced and lawful regulatory environment, regardless of who serves.”
“We value strong, impartial regulation for the benefit of customers who rely on us for their electricity, heat, and water to be delivered safely and reliably,” Ratliff continued. “We are ready to work with partners in a constructive fashion to deliver cost-effective solutions for customers to provide them with stable bills and strong customer service.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid, which owns the electric utility United Illuminating, did not immediately comment on Lamont’s appointment Monday.
When asked whether he had any concerns regarding Gillett’s deletion of text messages, Lamont said he would wait for the matter to be adjudicated in the courts. Still, he said he would urge the chairwoman to be “fully transparent,” and offered another bit of public advice.
“Stay away from the press,” he said. “Stay away from those type of ways that people can say, ‘Oh, my God, you have a point of view one way or the other.’ Everybody in life has a point of view, I can’t deny that, but I don’t think you should be doing that in the press.”
Lamont said he is also close to making a decision on other appointments he has promised to make in order to fill current and possible future vacancies on PURA’s five-member board. Those picks would go before the General Assembly for confirmation. 
While declining to say who, exactly, he was considering, Lamont noted that Republican former lawmaker Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme has “a big following.” Lamont had previously promised to nominate Cheeseman earlier this year as part of a deal to ease Gillett’s confirmation. 
Lamont said that he would like to have his picks vetted and announced in time for them to be confirmed when lawmakers meet later this year in a special session, potentially in September.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_105-2025_0630-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

Washington remains one of the 12 states and the District of Columbia who are home to more adults who oppose rather than favor Christian prayer in schools. More specifically, 61% of adults oppose allowing teachers to lead their classes in prayer that refer to Jesus with 37% in favor. Included in this list are California, Oregon, District of Columbia and much of New England.
Idaho is listed as one of 16 states populated by adults who are divided over prayers said by public school teachers that mention Jesus. The analysis found 44% opposing this kind of prayer in public schools with 55% who support it. Pew Research Center said this was not significant enough of a difference to place it in either category, factoring in the margin of error. States included alongside Idaho as divided are Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, Maine and Virginia.
The analysis — which came out of the Pew Research Religious Landscape Study published in February 2025 — went deeper and sought to answer what the percentages would be if the prayer in public school was more generic to “God” rather than to “Jesus.”
“Nationwide, a slightly larger share of Americans say they favor allowing teacher-led prayers referencing God (57%) than favor allowing teacher-led prayers specifically referencing Jesus (52%),” wrote Chip Rotolo in the June 23 Pew analysis.
Washington adults came significantly closer to the middle with this question with 41% still opposing prayer (compared to 61% opposing prayer with Jesus’ name) in public schools with 56% supporting them (compared to 37%).
This change may be owed to the religious life of non-Christian faiths in Washington. On the national level, when Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu adults were asked the question of teachers leading their classes in prayer to God but not a specific religion, the statistics in favor went up. While they didn’t go up significantly for Jewish adults (26% from 11%) and Buddhists (37% from 27%), the increase went to more than half in favor of prayer in school for Muslims (55% from 23%) and Hindus (56% from 31%).
When asked about generic prayers in public school, Idaho adults did not move the needle too drastically. However, they did move their state from the divided category into the in favor one,  with 58% adults in favor of prayer in public school (from 55%) and 41% opposed (from 44%).

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
What the end of the ‘roadless rule’ could mean for Utah’s national forests

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.













The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers





“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., is not running in 2026. Now it's a mad dash for both parties to fill an open seat in the midterms","Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon announce he's not seeking re-election at Eppley Airfield in Omaha on Jun 30. 2025.  (Aaron sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — It’s official. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is not running in 2026. 
The retired Air Force brigadier general announced his retirement from the House to a group of local reporters Monday, confirming leaks that emerged late last week in Washington, D.C., and Omaha, that his fifth term representing the Omaha area in the U.S. House would be his last.
“I hope to be remembered for … I’m a Christian, first … American, second … somewhere down here being a Republican,” Bacon told reporters. “It’s about doing the right thing … I’m a traditional conservative at heart.”
Infrastructure vote
Bacon held his announcement at under-construction Eppley Airfield, a backdrop he chose partly because he might have to fly back to Washington, D.C. for a vote on Trump mega-bill, and partly to highlight his pivotal vote helping pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which put him at odds with President Donald Trump.
Bacon touted his ability to pass 38 bills during his time in Congress and his willingness to work across the aisle.

Trump had tried and failed to get Congress to pass a similar bill while he was president the first time. He then tried to torpedo the bill when Congress had enough votes to pass it under President Joe Biden. Trump, after the vote, criticized Bacon publicly during a May 2022 visit to Nebraska, calling him “bad news.” His political team worked for years to recruit potential GOP primary challengers.
But Bacon kept winning and continued to publicly spar with Trump. He is one of a few House Republicans left who represents a true swing district. Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District backed Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Biden in 2020, and Trump in 2016.
Still, Bacon has proven a reliable Republican vote, often after receiving pressure from Trump and what he calls “reassurances” from House GOP  leadership that some of his concerns about proposals will be addressed.
Choosing batttles
Bacon told reporters Monday that he learned to “pick and choose” his battles. 
“If you’ve never fallen on your sword, there’s something wrong with you,” Bacon said. “If you fall on your sword every day, there’s something wrong with you.”
Several Nebraska Republican elected officials thanked Bacon for his congressional service. U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer said Bacon had “faithfully served our country and the people of Nebraska.” 
“I have enjoyed working alongside Don on many issues facing our nation, and I will miss partnering with him on solutions that strengthen our Nebraska communities,” said Fischer, who often calls Bacon by his Air Force call sign, “Bits.”
Many of Bacon’s critics have described the distance between his words and actions as hypocrisy. He has defended his record as one that shows independence and pragmatism. 
The House Majority PAC, an important political arm of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, issued a statement saying Bacon was running away. 
“After voting to gut health care and jack up costs for working families, Don Bacon is headed for the hills because he knows he can’t win,” the statement said.
No more two-year cycles

Bacon said he could win re-election, but said it’s time for “a new Republican” to hold the seat, one with the energy to handle the long days and year-round combination of constituent work and campaigning a swing district requires. 
Bacon says he sees himself as a “Reagan Republican.” He explains that as someone who does not give in to the impulses of isolationism or the temptations of assuming American military power endures without investment.  Local Republicans sometimes grew frustrated with Bacon. Some protested his office during fights over who should replace Bacon’s friend Kevin McCarthy as House speaker. He opposed populist U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.
The Nebraska Republican Party targeted Bacon after a Trump-focused leadership change in 2022. Bacon at times reminded his critics that in 2020 and 2024, in the 2nd District, he secured more votes than Trump. 
“I want to be a voice for traditional Republican views,” Bacon said Monday. 
Voters in a mixed district with a slight GOP lean after the most recent redistricting rarely punished Bacon for talking like a moderate and voting with conservatives. The 2nd District includes all of urban Douglas County and rural Saunders County and parts of western suburban Sarpy County.
Candidates lining up
Local conservatives, including Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding, former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei, have been discussed as potential  GOP primary contenders. Political observers expect one or more to join the race as early as this week, now that Bacon has announced. 
Harding issued a statement on social media after Bacon’s announcement, congratulating him on his retirement from Congress. He called Bacon a “true statesman.”
“Don has been a true servant leader for our community,” Lindstrom said.  
Already a group of Democrats is jockeying for the nomination. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. A third potential candidate, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades has said she is considering a House bid.
Also running are Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
Bacon rose to local prominence in the Air Force. He honed cyber expertise as some weapons of war shifted from bombs to keystrokes. He led the 55th Wing at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base. But in local and national GOP circles he was known as the swing Republican who kept winning. He beat the last Democrat to serve the 2nd District, the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford.
He survived the “blue wave” of 2018 by beating progressive nonprofit executive Kara Eastman and beat her again in 2020. Then he twice defeated State Sen. Tony Vargas of South Omaha.
Bacon said he was unsure what he would do next, but added he liked leading and executive work, whether that in the private sector or another elected role, remains to be seen.  
“I look forward to being part of this community and expanding our friendships, Bacon said. “I am grateful to those who voted for me, and those who didn’t vote for me. I appreciate the opportunity to serve.” 
Not yet done
Bacon stressed on Monday that he is not done in the House, nor does he expect to coast to retirement. This week, he once again finds himself in a position to cast a potentially pivotal vote for a mega-bill at the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda. He reemphasized some of his concerns about the Senate version of the bill’s proposed cuts to Medicaid, but also highlighted the Trump tax cuts as a positive.
“Are we better off keeping the tax cuts permanent, keeping the inheritance tax off, keeping the investment tax credits on, and the things that we’re going to do for our military in this bill?” Bacon asked. “There’s a lot of great stuff in this legislation too.” 
Angie Bacon, after the news conference, said she was looking forward to spending more time with her husband. She said she had a list of chores for him to do around the house, starting with just being home.
She said the hardest part of serving — for a member of Congress and family, is being “willing to let them serve and sacrifice your time with them.”

(Provided/SC Department of Public Safety)COLUMBIA — Take a good look at the extra Highway Patrol cruisers on South Carolina’s roads for the Fourth of July, because the state’s public safety department wants to know whether they’re the best in the country.
For the 11th year in a row, the Department of Public Safety is vying for a spot on the American Association of State Troopers’ annual calendar of best-looking cruisers, which features the 13 state cruisers with the most votes. The Palmetto State has never appeared in the calendar, thought it came close in 2023, when its then-new Mustang cruiser landed in 14th place.
Anyone who doesn’t know what the cruisers look like can get a good look this weekend. As for previous holidays, the state Highway Patrol will have extra officers patrolling the roads, starting at 6 p.m. Thursday ahead of Independence Day through midnight Sunday, said spokesman Kyle McGahee. The extra cruisers will be monitoring for drunken drivers and other hazardous driving as more people take to the roads for the holiday, he said.
Alongside the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Natural Resources will increase the number of officers patrolling waterways for people boating under the influence and use planes to patrol state highways.
If those cruisers impress, people can vote on the association’s website. This year, Highway Patrol submitted a photo of one of its 2023 Mustangs alongside a 2024 F-150 truck. The truck was one of 35 the department started rolling out last year, replacing some of its older Dodge Chargers.
Voting for the 2026 calendar is open until 5 p.m. July 11. A person can vote once per device, meaning a single person can vote from both a laptop and a smartphone, according to the agency.
Calendars sold for $10 each last year. Proceeds from those sales go toward the American Association of State Troopers Foundation, which gives educational scholarships to troopers’ children nationwide.
The contest’s top vote-getter will grace the calendar’s cover — a privilege that last year went to Florida, which posed its cruiser in front of a rocket mid-launch.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upstate-Truck-and-Mustang-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

(Courtesy of U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexx Mercer) New Mexico’s claims against Cannon Air Force Base for environmental and public health damage from so-called “forever chemicals” in groundwater will move to the forefront of a sprawling lawsuit.
New Mexico is part of multi-state litigation in North Carolina, which includes a combined 10,000-plus cases from across the country seeking damages from fire-fighting foam containing per-and-poly fluorinated alkyl substances — PFAS — at civilian and military sites.
A North Carolina-based federal judge gave the nod last week for New Mexico to proceed with its efforts to seek compensation from the federal government, which operates Cannon, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), often nicknamed the Superfund law, an environmental department news release stated Friday.
Out of more than 500 cases in the court, New Mexico’s will act as a test for how others will be decided, New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney told Source NM.
“New Mexico’s case was selected as a bellwether case to move forward within the multistrict litigation,” Kenney said. “So essentially, little trials are going to start happening in the South Carolina federal court; they’re going to be indicative of how large numbers of cases will proceed.”
If the judge determines Cannon had responsibility for contamination under Superfund law, the federal government will be required to compensate the state for ongoing cleanup, restoration or replacement of groundwater. The damages are being pursued through the New Mexico Office of Natural Resources Trustee, and would require clean up to “prepollution standards.”
“Everything is at stake for us in this multidistrict litigation,” Kenney said.
The outcome of the case could impact settlement negotiations with the federal government and manufacturers of the chemicals, according to the news release.
“For too long, the federal government has ignored its responsibility to clean up the toxic legacy it left behind in communities like Clovis,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “This case gives us the opportunity to establish once and for all that the United States can and will be held accountable for poisoning our water, harming our residents, and threatening our agricultural economy. We are proud to lead this fight — not just for New Mexico, but for every community impacted by PFAS contamination.”
New Mexico files new lawsuit against US Air Force over PFAS contamination

New Mexico’s reckoning with PFAS stretches back years.
Contamination from areas surrounding military bases infiltrated nearby dairy cows in Clovis, resulting in the euthanasia and disposal of more than 3,000 cows in October 2022. Recent studies found the plants and animals at Holloman Lake outside of Alamogordo contain the highest levels of measured PFAS in the world.
New Mexico joined multi-state litigation in North Carolina in 2019, but updated its lawsuit in 2024 requesting a judge to award monetary damages and compel cleanup across five military sites in New Mexico. So far, only the claims against Cannon are moving forward.
The State of New Mexico is embroiled in separate litigation in Denver federal appeals courts, after the Department of Defense sued the state, claiming it overstepped its authority it manding cleanup.
The development in the multi-state litigation comes as the state filed a new lawsuit last week against the U.S. Department of Defense in state district court. In contrast to the multi-state litigation, the damages available in state courts require cleanup to a lower standard, Kenney said.
“Regulatory standards don’t always get you the full remediation,” Kenney said. “Our state court claims and our multidistrict claims all around Cannon achieve different outcomes, but we want them all to proceed.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)We believe our families are worth fighting for and so is our future. That’s why our organizations came together this legislative session to insist that state lawmakers invest in all of us — the people of Washington state.
We, along with so many advocates and everyday people, reminded lawmakers they faced a false choice. Responsibly dealing with a budget deficit didn’t have to mean cutting funding from early learning and public schools, health care and support for people with disabilities, affordable housing programs and the jobs of state employees. 
Lawmakers could have made a different, better choice: find new sources of revenue that fund the programs and services people rely on. We insisted that legislators work to balance our state’s upside-down tax code — one that already favors the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations at the expense of everyone else. Spoiler alert: They did a bit of both.
Our tax code can only be described as upside-down and rigged to benefit those with the most. 
For almost 100 years, our tax code has relied heavily on three main revenue sources – sales tax, property tax, and business and occupation tax – that make for an antiquated structure that doesn’t reflect today’s economic realities. 
Our tax code asks those with the least to pay the highest percent of their income in state and local taxes. Working families are taxed at a rate up to six times higher than the wealthiest in our state. Even after the passage of the capital gains tax on the ultra-wealthy in 2021, our state tax code is still rated second to last in the country when it comes to tax fairness.
Simply put: Revenue collected into our state coffers can’t keep up with our real needs. From a growing population to increasing demands for state services to the effects of inflation, it costs more every year to meet the needs of Washingtonians. As a result, legislators face structural budget challenges year after year. While legislators this year turned to new and higher taxes to fill roughly $9 billion of a budget hole estimated to be $12 billion or more, they’ll have to solve the same problem again in the future.
Legislators started the session bolstered by an electorate that voted overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining the capital gains tax they passed in 2021. They proposed bold new progressive revenue measures that would have avoided cuts to vital programs and helped permanently address the structural budget issues that perennially plague state budget writers.
On the progressive revenue menu this year were new ideas like taxing Tesla and other electric car manufacturers who sell their excess zero-emission vehicle credits for huge profits. Lawmakers ultimately picked some low-hanging fruit. They closed tax loopholes, taxed synthetic nicotine products, extended sales tax to IT services, and raised taxes on alcohol.
Legislators also relied on more conventional – and popular – taxes like making the capital gains tax even more progressive by raising the rate for profits over $1 million. Lawmakers raised business and occupation taxes, adding surcharges for the most profitable corporations like financial institutions and advanced computing businesses.
Regrettably, some of the best ideas to pump the brakes on wealth inequality did not pass. The High-Earner Tax on Employers, which would have ensured our state’s largest businesses do their part, and a Financial Intangibles Tax on the ultra-wealthy did not survive. These policies would have raised the most revenue, made our tax code more equitable, and prevented cuts to vital services.
Still, we applauded legislative leaders and rank-and-file members alike for their work to save programs that working families depend on. Unfortunately, that turned to a slow clap as we watched a few of the state’s biggest businesses pick off key votes with their multi-million-dollar lobbying campaign. We wish the new governor had provided a clearer vision and direction to prevent harmful budget cuts.
In the end, legislators were forced to slash some services because they knew the governor would only approve a limited scope of revenue bills. They eliminated a program to support foster youth and delayed implementation of several programs, including early learning for kids from low-income households. They also made the biggest cut to abortion access funding in state history.
Our organizations are in this for the long haul, fighting for a Washington where everyone belongs and can thrive. We showed up in Olympia this session as parents, seniors, teachers, caregivers, and state employees, and thousands of us rallied, wrote letters, signed in, and testified in support of revenue over cuts. We’ll be back again next year because we believe that everyone should pitch in, including the wealthiest individuals and biggest corporations, so all of us can have thriving communities. We’re worth fighting for.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)SHEPHERDSVILLE — With a third Republican candidate entering the race for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat next year, the jockeying for President Donald Trump’s backing is on. 
While neither Trump nor longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell will be on Kentucky’s ballot in 2026, their presences loom large over the next election cycle in the Bluegrass state. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman, appeared before a crowd of more than 1,200 with Turning Point USA founder and conservative media personality Charlie Kirk in the Bullitt County seat Monday morning. Morris announced his candidacy last week on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. 
Morris, along with Republicans U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, are hoping to succeed McConnell, who announced he would not seek reelection earlier this year. McConnell’s rise to power in 1984 ushered in the Republican Party of Kentucky’s rise to political dominance in the commonwealth. However, McConnell has lost voters’ approval in recent years.

Morris hopes to court Republican voters who are unhappy with McConnell’s tenure. During the Monday rally, Morris called on the Republican Party of Kentucky to deny McConnell a lifetime achievement award.
Morris also took issue with a letter from the state Republican party to candidates ahead of the annual Lincoln Day Dinner set for August. Morris said the letter asked candidates to not “speak ill of Republicans that are not running for office.” That would include McConnell, who Morris added is set to receive a lifetime achievement award during the dinner.
“I am calling on the Republican Party of Kentucky to rescind the lifetime achievement award for Mitch McConnell,” Morris said to applause from the crowd. “And I’m asking the other two guys in the race, Daniel Cameron and Andy Barr, to do the same thing. And if they won’t, I want to hear why.”
Morris dropped his first TV ad Friday morning, saying he is “here to take out the trash,” including McConnell’s. Morris, who rides a garbage truck and picks up trash in the ad, founded waste and recycling company Rubicon. 
After the rally, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Kentucky told the Kentucky Lantern that the letter “was simply a request — not an attempt to police candidates’ speech.” Political parties often do not back candidates until a nominee is chosen for a general election. 
Kirk throughout the rally criticized McConnell, particularly for not backing Trump in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. McConnell, as the Senate Republican leader, later called the event “a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election.” McConnell disputed Trump’s claims that he won the 2020 election and has been an opponent of U.S. isolationism and a  strong supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia, in contrast to Trump on the campaign trail last year. McConnell also voted against confirming Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump has criticized McConnell multiple times over the years, even though McConnell played a key role in confirming the Supreme Court justices who have been upholding some of Trump’s controversial actions. 
“He’s willing to actually call out the McConnell mafia that have been running this state for so long,” Kirk said of Morris. 
The Republican candidates have been trying to distance themselves from McConnell in hopes that a Trump endorsement in Kentucky — a state that the president has carried since the 2016 election — would bring the seal of approval from the state’s GOP voters.

Meanwhile, Trump has his eyes on another Bluegrass Republican — U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of the 4th Congressional District. In recent weeks, Massie has become a thorn in the president’s side, by opposing Trump’s domestic policy bill and criticizing the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Trump’s political allies have launched a PAC to wage a primary war against the Northern Kentucky congressman, starting with a $1 million ad buy. 
When asked about Trump’s involvement in Massie’s primary after his own rally, Morris said Republicans have “to stand with the president, period.” 
“We got to get along as a party,” Morris said. “We’ve got the political winds at our back, and we’ve got to use this momentum to get stuff done and get the agenda done that the people of Kentucky voted for.”
State Rep. T.J Roberts, R-Burlington, said before Morris’ rally that “Thomas Massie has my complete and total endorsement.” Roberts, who was elected to the state House in 2024, has close ties to the congressman. 
“He really represented MAGA before MAGA was even a thing,” Roberts said of Massie. “He has consistently worked to fulfill President Trump’s agenda, and I really hope that the two can get back to working together. I stand with President Trump, I stand with Congressman Massie, and I don’t think it’s difficult to stand with both.”

On the U.S. Senate race, Roberts said he views the election as a chance to allow the Kentucky GOP to “choose its new path forward.” Roberts said that he doesn’t think “it’s truly possible to move past someone who really built the infrastructure,” like McConnell, but today’s Republicans are more conservative than they have been in recent decades. Roberts, one of the young members of the state legislature, added that his generation has been impacted by a growing national debt and inflation as the result of a government that “has consistently ignored the young.” 
“Yeah, we’re absolutely moving on, and it’s time to make sure that young Americans get their representation in Washington, D.C., get their representation in Frankfort,” Roberts said. “I think my election was a show of that, and I think 2026 is going to be a show of that, too.” 
Another GOP state lawmaker, Rep. Josh Calloway, of Irvington, said that he is “excited about a once in a 40-year opportunity” with the open U.S. Senate seat for Republican voters. The result could have implications not just for Kentucky, but the nation as a whole. 
“People are flocking in here,” Calloway said as attendees looked for seats before the rally. “Charlie Kirk is here. And yeah, things have changed in Kentucky to some degree.” 
Morris doubts that his McConnell bashing will turn away Kentucky Republicans or hurt his campaign.
“Look, I think that the numbers speak for themselves. I’ve seen them,” Morris told reporters. “Mitch McConnell is one of the least popular politicians in the history of America, and I think here in Kentucky, I don’t think it’s any different.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4414-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

Plagued by major differences over issues like tax policy and pay for teachers and state employees, House and Senate Republicans were unable to reach agreement before commencing their summer break and so the state will continue to limp along on the old budget for the time being.
Republicans did however find common ground on several conservative culture war priorities like weakening gun laws, banning diversity, equity and inclusion, and targeting the rights of transgender people and immigrants, and this past week, NC Newsline caught up with Wake County State Senator Lisa Grafstein to learn more.

(Getty Images)I worked underground in the mines for 20 years, starting in 1977. Then I spent almost two more decades fighting for the safety and health of coal miners in the U.S. and around the world. I’ve seen a lot of hardship in this line of work. But nothing grinds a man down like black lung. It steals your breath, your strength and your ability to work — slowly and cruelly.
That’s why I am speaking out against the cuts to Medicaid in what they’re calling the One Big Beautiful Bill that the Senate will be voting on soon. That bill will hurt us in two big ways.
First, the bill imposes new “work requirements” to receive Medicaid. This may sound reasonable on paper but, here in West Virginia, it will do real harm. Miners with black lung disease are very sick, for very long, before they get “approved” as having a disability and are able to receive benefits. The company doctors make it so hard to qualify that I have known many people who have died before they got their benefits. It takes an average of seven years for a miner to get a final decision on his black lung claim. Seven years.
During that time, the miner usually can’t get disability benefits, because the system hasn’t classified him as being sick. But it is also damn hard for him to work, because it is damn hard for him to breathe. What keeps those men alive — and sometimes their wives, kids, and grandkids — is Medicaid. It covers their oxygen, their inhalers, and their hospital visits. It keeps people alive. It helps entire coal communities.
But under the new process in the One Big Beautiful Bill, getting and keeping Medicaid will get tangled up in red tape. People would be required to report their work each month to keep their health care. It they don’t submit the paperwork on time, if they get confused by the online portal, if they miss a deadline — they lose their health care.  
Miners are awesome, competent people. But many older miners do not have Internet access. Some never finished school. These are proud, working men, but filling out government forms online every month is not something they were trained for.
And if they lose coverage because of a mistake in reporting? They’ll get sicker. They will end up in the emergency room — or suffer in silence at home. Some people might say that miners won’t have to comply with these requirements. But that’s not at all clear. And what kind of paperwork will be required to be exempted? How long will that take? There are too many unanswered questions. The only thing that is clear is that these men will lose coverage and their health will be jeopardized even more.
The second big problem with the One Big Beautiful Bill affects all of us. Rural hospitals and clinics depend on Medicaid. In much of West Virginia, Medicaid provides the backbone of our health care system. These cuts to Medicaid will close more clinics, close rural hospitals and leave many of us having to travel miles to get even emergency health care.  
I am proud to have spent my life fighting for the health and safety of coal miners. In coal country, we know what it means to sacrifice your health for your job.  We should honor that sacrifice — not make people jump through more hoops to prove they are worthy of health care.  
If these cuts to Medicaid go through, more miners will die waiting for treatment. More of our clinics and hospitals will close their doors. And all West Virginians will suffer.

(Getty Images)I returned home to the United States from Scotland in March of 2020 with my master’s degree and a lump in my breast I had yet to discover.
The next day, the world started to shut down from COVID-19. Three weeks later, I discovered that lump and my cancer journey unofficially started. On my 34th birthday I underwent an MRI, got my diagnosis and it became official. My world suddenly looked nothing like it did a few weeks earlier when I boarded that airplane.
As a student, I was covered by Scotland’s national plan and had yet to get settled with a plan back home. When I was diagnosed, hospital staff helped me apply for Medicaid. I was worried people would look down on me. 
Some people think not having insurance all ties back to not having a job. That is one of the reasons a person might have Medicaid coverage, but it covers so many others as well, including seasonal workers in tourism, like me, commercial fishing and energy as well as children, women who are single moms and folks in nursing homes. More than half of Alaska employers do not provide benefits as part of work compensation. 
I think of all the times people are out of work, like I was, through no fault of their own. It’s not laziness or lack of ability, but simple timing. My husband is a doctor and we spent a month without health care when he was moving from one job to another. There’s absolutely no reason someone should risk death because they’re between jobs. 
All my doctors and other medical staff took great care of me, and the treatments and technology they used to beat back — and ultimately defeat — my disease would not have been possible had financial barriers been in place, even partially.
Access to Medicaid may well have saved my life, and it certainly has saved the lives of others. Having access to Medicaid allowed me to make decisions about my treatment without worrying about cost, debt, or financial ruin. A cancer diagnosis is enough to worry about, without wondering which treatments you can afford without potential bankruptcy. That’s a dark choice and not one anybody should have forced upon them by something like a cancer diagnosis.
Six years later it saddens me to think this program could soon be unavailable to other folks in my situation. The proposed cuts to the federal Medicaid program could put significant limitations on what we in Alaska call Denali Care and Denali KidCare. If passed, the “Big, Beautiful Bill” could make it so that health care coverage will be financially out of reach for many, including seasonal workers like myself. As a sea kayak guide, I do not have benefits through work but am fortunate enough to be insured through my husband’s employment.
The bill’s $1.1 tillion in Medicaid cuts will remove coverage from more than 25,000 in our state, but the downstream effects will hurt far more folks than just those who currently access care through the program. New data from the University of Alaska Anchorage indicates an estimated 3,000 jobs will be lost and uncompensated care costs to Alaska hospitals will result in increased premiums for folks on private insurance plans, which will lead to fewer people being able to afford those and so, yet another wave of uninsured. Alaska will be one of the hardest states hit in percentage of jobs lost and the financial hit to our economy is estimated at more than $320 million annually.
The cost to our state will be staggering yet our federal lawmakers seem to be on board with it despite warning signs coming from all angles — health care providers, economists, business leaders and even the Alaska Legislature, which passed a resolution asking Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich to fight the bill on their behalf. 
I sometimes think that my cancer journey has been pretty “easy” compared to what some people go through. I did have three surgeries to get it properly removed, but I didn’t need chemo, and I had a great support system. 
But that’s the point, right? It’s cancer. No one ever really has it easy. And thankfully Medicaid is there to take away one aspect of it that could make everything so much harder.
If our lawmakers hear our voices above those of the other D.C. power brokers, they’ll know the best decision.
I hope Medicaid is there for those who need it for generations to come.

Utah and other states have pushed the federal government to hand over public lands, and a sweeping proposal in Congress could put millions of acres up for sale. (Photo by Spenser Heaps /Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.










The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers


“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress (Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline).HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)An 82-year-old woman has died from injuries she sustained during a firebombing attack in Boulder earlier this month, when a man targeted peaceful marchers who were calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 
Karen Diamond died of severe injuries, according to a Monday statement from the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office. The office has identified 29 victims of the attack on the Pearl Street Mall, 13 of whom were physically injured.
“This horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends,” Michael Dougherty, the district attorney, said in the statement. “Our hearts are with the Diamond family during this incredibly difficult time. Our office will fight for justice for the victims, their loved ones, and the community.”

Dougherty added, “Part of what makes Colorado special is that people come together in response to a tragedy; I know that the community will continue to unite in supporting the Diamond family and all the victims of this attack.” 
Diamond was a participant in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, an organization that has led weekly walks in the city’s downtown area for nearly two years in support of the release of hostages taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. There are still 50 hostages in Hamas captivity, according to The Associated Press.
The suspect in the attack allegedly told police that he targeted the demonstration because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian citizen, has been charged as the suspect in the attack. He now faces first-degree murder charges, as well as federal hate crime charges and more than 100 state-level criminal charges. A preliminary hearing in the state case is set for July 15.

,DC,2025-06-30 18:13:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate kicks off vote-a-rama on massive tax and spending cut bill,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-kicks-vote-rama-massive-tax-and-spending-cut-bill,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate launched a marathon amendment voting session Monday during which lawmakers will debate dozens of proposals from Republicans and Democrats that could significantly reshape the “big, beautiful bill” even as a final vote nears.The vote-a-rama is expected to last throughout Monday and potentially into Tuesday, challenging senators who aren't accustomed to having to stay on the floor for all hours of the day and night. At the end, the Senate will vote on final passage and if the tax and spending cut bill is successful it will be taken up next in the House, possibly as soon as Wednesday morning.The first big debate and vote Monday centered around Republicans’ decision to use current policy instead of current law to determine the bill’s fiscal impacts.Congress has long used current law to determine how much legislation will add or subtract from annual deficits, especially when it comes to the budget reconciliation process that is being used for this bill.But since Republicans’ 2017 tax law was set to expire at the end of the year, using the current law baseline showed significantly higher deficits than using current policy — which could prove to be a political problem.The debate, wonky even for the Senate, could have ripple effects in the future, especially if Democrats ever get unified control of government and use the change in process that GOP lawmakers set this time around for their own policy goals.Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said during brief debate before the vote that using current policy would allow the GOP to make many of the tax levels in the 2017 law permanent, instead of having to sunset them to comply with reconciliation rules.“What I’m trying to do, and I’m very happy about it, is to make sure the tax cuts don’t expire 10 years from now,” Graham said.Reconciliation bills cannot increase the deficit after the 10-year budget window ends.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York spoke out against using current policy over current law, rebuking his Republican colleagues, though his arguments were ultimately unsuccessful. “Republicans are doing something the Senate has never done before — deploying fake math, accounting gimmicks to hide the true cost of the bill,” Schumer said. “Look, Republicans can use whatever budgetary gimmicks they want to try to make the math work on paper but you can’t paper over the real-life economic consequences of adding tens of trillions to the debt.”The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its current law score of the bill on Sunday, showing the legislation would add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade.Senators voted 53-47 along party lines against overruling Graham’s decision to use current policy.Narrow majoritySenators spent the next few hours debating Democratic changes to the bill that would have addressed Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But no Democratic proposals had been adopted as of Monday afternoon and Republicans had yet to start voting on their own amendments.Once both sides exhaust themselves, the Senate will move on to a final passage vote. With a narrow 53-seat majority, GOP leaders can only afford to lose three members and still have the bill pass with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.Two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky — already indicated they’ll oppose the bill when they voted against advancing it late Saturday night. Altering the bill could cause issues for other senators, making the entire process a headache for GOP leadership.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech that the core of the sweeping package is focused on avoiding a cliff created when Republicans approved lower tax rates during President Donald Trump’s first term.“This is about extending that tax relief so the same people that benefited from it back in 2017 and for the last eight years don’t end up having a colossal, massive tax increase hitting them in the face come January 1,” Thune said.Schumer sharply criticized the policy changes and spending cuts in the mega-bill, saying they would lead to fewer people being able to access safety-net programs, like Medicaid, which provides health insurance coverage for low-income people and some people with disabilities, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food assistance for low-income people.“How can any senator go home and tell their constituents, ‘I’m sorry, I took away your health care because I wanted to give tax breaks to billionaires?’” Schumer said. “And yet Republicans are dead set on walking off a cliff by passing a bill they know will be ruinous to their own constituents.”‘Wraparound amendment’Depending on how popular an amendment is and exactly what aspects of the legislation it seeks to change, it could increase or decrease the number of GOP senators willing to vote for the final version of the bill.Republican leaders will want to fend off all Democratic amendments, though if some do get added, Thune can use a procedural tactic called a “wraparound amendment” at the end to cut any problematic changes by wiping out Democratic amendments with a majority vote.In addition to providing an opportunity for senators to debate nitty gritty policy details, the vote-a-rama serves a political purpose for Democrats, who will try to get at-risk senators to take votes that can then be used during the midterm elections to try to sway voters. Those amendments will mostly focus on Maine’s Susan Collins after North Carolina’s Tillis announced his retirement Sunday.While Democrats have more incentive for so-called “gotcha amendments” since they’re trying to flip the Senate from red to blue, GOP leaders may also bring up amendments challenging vulnerable Democratic senators, like Georgia’s Jon Ossoff.And since the opportunity to put up as many amendments as a senator pleases is rare, both Democrats and Republicans may have an eye on purple-state lawmakers up for reelection in 2028.",,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

The attacks on trans people at the North Carolina legislature are clearly part of a coordinated national campaign from the political right that has also impacted a number of other institutions. This week marks the end of Pride Month and it’s clear that the anti-LGBTQ movement led by the Trump administration has managed to temper the support of some traditional Pride Month supporters in the corporate community.
That said, as NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield learned in a conversation with Equality North Carolina executive director Eliazar Posada, many other Pride supporters have stepped up their efforts and despite the actions of some companies and developments at the legislature, the energy, enthusiasm, activism and long-term optimism among equality supporters in North Caroline remains high and on the upswing.

The Iowa Board of Massage Therapy recently charged Phelan Hudson of Ames with failing to exercise the expected degree of care for practitioners, and with habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs.
According to the board, two separate complaints were filed against Hudson in 2023. During the subsequent investigation, the board says, it was determined that Hudson inappropriately draped a client in preparation for a massage and then “made physical contact with parts with the client’s body that were not typical of the client’s expectations.”
In addition, the board alleges that during its 2023 investigation, it was determined that in 2019, a year after he was first licensed by the board, another of Hudson’s clients had filed a complaint alleging Hudson had been falling asleep during a massage.
In response to that allegation, the board says, Hudson disclosed, in “full transparency,” that there was a strong possibility he was under the influence of drugs while at work and giving massages.
In order to resolve the case, Hudson recently agreed to surrender his license.
Other recent actions against state-licensed massage therapists include:
— Meifang Pan of Sioux City, who was the subject of a 2024 complaint to the board. The board alleges that during its investigation of the complaint, it was determined that Pan owned and operated Asian Herbal Massage at 3130 Floyd Boulevard in Sioux City where, in August 2023, local police investigated reports of prostitution and other illegal activity.
Court records indicate that an undercover officer was offered sex by an unlicensed massage therapist at Asian Herbal Massage, after which police seized $4,416 in cash from the business, as well as lubricants and condoms. The employee was charged with prostitution, according to court records and board documents, but the disposition of that case is unclear.
According to police, at least two other employees of Pan’s business were also offering massages without a valid license. Pan allegedly admitted she was aware her workers were not properly licensed and was charged with aiding and abetting, a serious misdemeanor. She later received a deferred judgment in the case, according to board records.
The board recently charged Pan with knowingly aiding, assisting, procuring, or advising a person to unlawfully practice as a massage therapist; permitting an unlicensed employee to perform massages; negligence in the practice of the profession; and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
To settle the case, Pan recently agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.
— Katisha Knight of Ames, who was charged with practicing massage at some undefined point between 2014 and 2025 while her license was on “inactive” status. The board alleges that in January 2025, it received three complaints against Knight related to allegations she was practicing massage therapy without an active license – which she allegedly admitted. She was then charged with representing herself as a massage therapist while her license was inactive, suspended or revoked.
To settle the charges against her, Knight recently agreed to pay a $300 civil penalty. Her license has been reactivated by the board.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/massage-getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The United States Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a previous court’s decision to return Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline to state court. 
The Court’s decision comes months after arguments resumed in state court, where Judge James S. Jamo has yet to rule on motions from both the attorney general’s office and the Canadian energy company.
Nessel first filed her case aimed at shutting down the more than 70-year-old Line 5 in 2019, citing concerns that the dual pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac could rupture, resulting in a catastrophic oil spill in the waters where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.

After more than a year of litigation, Enbridge filed a successful motion to have the matter heard in federal court. While Nessel filed a motion to return the case to state court, her initial request was denied. She was later granted interlocutory appeal, allowing a federal appeals court to determine the proper venue for the case before it was fully litigated in federal court. 
Nessel argued that Enbridge failed to abide by the 30-day deadline to request a move to federal court, filing their motion at the end of 2021. 
The Court of Appeals ultimately determined the matter belongs in state court, agreeing that the pipeline company had missed the deadline and later rejecting Enbridge’s request for a rehearing. 
In an email, Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company was encouraged that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Sixth Circuit’s decision, arguing it conflicts with two other federal courts of appeals decisions, which determined there are exceptions to the 30-day limit.
“The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals,” Duffy said. 
He noted the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to review the matter would not impact the company’s other case against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen, over the governor’s decision to revoke the company’s permit to operate Line 5 on the lakebed beneath the Straits of Mackinac.

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images).More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

4-year-old son, Anh Hoang, who had received only the first of the measles vaccine’s two
doses. Nguyen took his family to a primary care clinic, where his son got his second shot.
He was surprised when his insurer did not cover the vaccine — and its $1,400 price tag.
(Scott Dalton for KFF Health News)In the early days of the West Texas measles outbreak, Thang Nguyen eyed the rising number of cases and worried. His 4-year-old son was at risk because he had received only the first of the vaccine’s two doses.
So, in mid-March, he took his family to a primary care clinic at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
By the end of the visit, his son, Anh Hoang, had received one shot protecting against four illnesses — measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. He also received a second shot against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, as well as a flu shot. His twin daughters, who had already had their measles vaccinations, got other immunizations.
Nguyen, who is a UTMB postdoctoral fellow in public health and infectious disease, said he asked clinic staff whether his family’s insurance would cover the checkups and immunizations. He said he was assured that it would.
Then the bills came.
The Medical Procedure
The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and became part of the combination measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in 1971. Today the vaccine against chickenpox, or varicella, is sometimes combined into what is known as the MMRV vaccine.
A first dose of the measles vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months, with a second between ages 4 and 6. Experts may recommend vaccinating children at younger ages during an outbreak — like the ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, which has led to more than 1,200 cases, 750 of them in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95% of the cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status is unknown.
Recommendations affecting administration and insurance coverage are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. In mid-June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the committee, adding vaccine skeptics. The new panel, which met last week, is expected to scrutinize past recommendations, including for the MMR vaccine.
The Final Bill
UTMB billed $2,532 for the boy’s office visit and three shots. The MMRV shot alone was billed at $1,422, plus $161 for administering it.
  Because of gaps in their insurance coverage and what an official with the health providerdescribed as billing errors by the primary care clinic, the Nguyen family of Galveston,Texas, ended up owing nearly $5,000 for checkups and immunizations for their threechildren. That included about $1,400 for an MMRV vaccine for 4-year-old Anh Hoang,administered amid the ongoing measles outbreak. (Scott Dalton for KFF Health News)
The Billing Problem: Coverage Gaps and Provider ‘Errors’
There are guardrails in the U.S. health system intended to prevent recommended vaccines from being prohibitively expensive. They did not help the Nguyen family.
Their health plan, purchased from insurance broker TaiAn for Nguyen’s wife and children and administered by the International Medical Group, does not cover immunizations. And, initially, the family was not offered assistance under the Vaccines for Children Program, a federally funded effort, created after a measles outbreak more than 30 years ago, that provides free immunizations for uninsured and underinsured children.
So the family was exposed to the sticker shock of U.S. medical care without insurance, with providers setting prices. In this case, UTMB’s price for the child’s MMRV shot was about $1,400, more than five times what the CDC says it costs in the private sector.
Nguyen was surprised when their insurer did not pay anything, leaving bills for his three children’s checkups that, combined, were close to $5,000.
He said the family’s income, from his job in UTMB’s labs, is less than $57,000 a year. Nguyen’s job provides him health insurance, but he balked at the $615 a month it would cost to cover his family, too, and instead purchased the one-year policy from TaiAn, which totaled $1,841. The policy covers certain types of office visits, emergency room care, hospitalization, and chemotherapy, but not immunizations or checkups.
Nguyen and his wife, who are from Vietnam, are living in the country on temporary visas while he completes his studies. In Vietnam, Nguyen said, the total cost of the preventive care his family received at the clinic would probably be no more than $300.
He was concerned about the high prices set by the clinic for the vaccines, particularly during a measles outbreak.
“It’s insane,” he said.
Carly Kessler, a spokesperson for International Medical Group, confirmed in an email to KFF Health News that the family’s plan does not cover preventive care, including immunizations.
After UTMB was contacted by KFF Health News, its vice president of clinical contracting strategies, Kent Pickering, looked into the matter. “This situation should not have happened” but did so because of “a series of errors,” he said in an interview.
Most insurance offered in the U.S. must cover, without copays, a variety of preventive care services — including the measles vaccine — under rules in the Affordable Care Act. But some plans are exempt from those rules, including short-term plans or travel insurance. International students on temporary visas do not have to buy an ACA-compliant plan during their first five years in the country.
But what about the cost of the vaccines?
Hospitals and other providers may set their own prices for services, creating price lists called chargemasters. Insurers negotiate discounts for services they agree to cover. People with no insurance coverage are generally on the hook for the full amount.
“One of the most frustrating parts of our health care system is that people who don’t have health insurance coverage have to pay far more than even a health insurance company would pay,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
While prices can vary, the CDC’s Vaccines for Children Program price list shows the MMRV vaccine — also known by the brand name ProQuad — costs about $278 in the private sector. Consumer prices for ProQuad at Galveston-area pharmacies range from about $285 to $326, according to the prescription cost-tracking website GoodRx.
UTMB’s Pickering told KFF Health News that, initially, the Nguyen family’s insurance was entered incorrectly by the clinic staff, so they did not pick up that his plan didn’t cover vaccines. If they had, UTMB likely would have checked whether the Texas Vaccines for Children Program would cover the cost of the shots, charging only the program’s small administration fee.
A second error was uncovered when Pickering looked into the bill. He said UTMB’s chargemaster had been updated a few months earlier and the vaccine prices for those who do not receive shots through the children’s vaccine program were listed at incorrectly high amounts, resulting in the price Nguyen’s son was charged.
Pickering said the prices had been corrected, though he declined to cite exact figures.
The Resolution
In addition to contacting the insurer, Nguyen reached out to the financial offices at UTMB, asking for a reduction or waiver of the fees.
In mid-May, UTMB sent Nguyen a revised bill for his son’s office visit. It applied a 50% self-pay discount, which its website says is offered to those who are uninsured. His revised total was $1,266, $711 of which was for the MMRV vaccination.
“I expected them to waive the vaccination cost for my children or at least reduce it more, especially for MMRV vaccine,” said Nguyen, noting that his family would still be strapped trying to pay their bills.
After Pickering spoke with KFF Health News, a customer service representative reached out to Nguyen, waiving the cost of the vaccines. His new bill was $202.75 for his son’s office visit, as well as similarly smaller amounts for his daughters’ medical care.
The Takeaway
Medical billing experts say it’s always a good idea to check with your insurer before elective treatments like checkups or vaccinations to find out what is covered and how much you might owe.
International students and others who purchase non-ACA-compliant plans, such as short-term coverage, should carefully review their benefits, because there are often limitations.
For some services, including vaccinations, there may be lower-cost options.
Constance Almendarez, the immunization manager for the Galveston County Health District, said in an email that many public health departments, including Galveston’s, offer free vaccinations through the children’s vaccine program to those 18 and under who are eligible, including people without insurance or whose insurance does not cover vaccines.
But those programs are potentially threatened as the Trump administration institutes layoffs of federal workers and moves to cancel grants to health departments.
Finally, you can ask for a discount. Medical providers may offer self-pay discounts for patients who are uninsured or underinsured, or charity care policies to those who meet specified income requirements.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new statewide cellphone ban received mixed reviews from the Oklahoma City Board of Education while it implemented the policy on Monday.
The board voted 5-1 to restrict student cellphone use throughout the entire school day. Students will be allowed to have cellphones or other personal electronic devices on school premises, on school transportation and at school-sponsored activities, but they are forbidden from using the devices from the morning bell until dismissal at the end of the day. 
All Oklahoma districts have to implement a similar policy to comply with Senate Bill 139. The state Legislature and governor passed the law in May to ban cellphone use in public schools for the 2025-26 academic year with the goal of reducing distractions and behavioral issues in the classroom. 
After 2025-26, local school boards will have the choice to pick a different policy or continue with the same restrictions.
Responses from the Oklahoma City school board were a mix of intrigue, resignation and even frustration with the statewide mandate. 
“I’m pretty excited to hear about student outcomes and how this particular policy will affect that,” board member Jessica Cifuentes said.
Oklahoma City, with just under 33,000 children enrolled, was the largest district still permitting student cellphone access until the new law took effect. A growing number of districts, including the state’s largest, Tulsa Public Schools, already had begun implementing restrictions on cellphones.
Oklahoma City school board member Mike Shelton, a former state lawmaker, cast the only no vote against the new rule.
“I don’t disagree that we should pass a policy, but I’m not for the Legislature dictating what’s going on at the Oklahoma City Public Schools,” Shelton said during the board’s discussion.

Had a majority of the board voted against the policy, “we would put the district in harm’s way,” board Chairperson Paula Lewis said, though she said she does “respect not liking the Legislature telling us what to do.”
The new state law is unequivocal that, for the next academic year, all Oklahoma public schools must ban non-school-issued personal electronic devices except in emergency cases or for students monitoring a health issue.
Shelton also expressed concerns that schools could apply the cellphone ban and student discipline unevenly across the sprawling district.
District administrators and principals “will attempt to be on one accord” when putting the policy in practice at individual schools, Superintendent Jamie Polk said. Polk also pledged to update the board twice this school year on the policy’s implementation and its response within schools.
The new law requires districts to enforce the cellphone ban with disciplinary procedures.

General counsel Tony Childers said Oklahoma City schools will apply the district’s existing conduct regulations, which outline expected responses and punishment based on the severity of a student’s behavior. 
He said the district is “not looking at out-of-school suspension” to punish violations of the cellphone ban.
In-school suspension, detention, phone calls home and loss of privileges are some discipline options for repeat offenses, according to the district’s student code of conduct.

(Photo courtesy Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren’s Facebook page)A wildfire that erupted over the weekend on the Navajo Nation near the New Mexico border has grown to more than 6,200 acres, according to the latest updates.
The Oak Springs fire began Saturday a few miles southwest of Saint Michaels, Ariz. and cast smoke throughout much of the area over the weekend, including nearby Gallup. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, in updates posted on social media, said wood haulers in the area may have started the fire, though its cause is still officially under investigation.
More than 400 people have responded to the fast-growing wildfire, which is 0% contained. On Monday, in response to the rapid fire spread, a complex incident management team took over the fire, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The Navajo Nation is ordering people in Hunter’s Point and Oak Springs west of mile marker 12 on Navajo Route 12 to flee, along with Saint Michaels’ residents along roads 603, 604, 605 and Navajo Telecommunications Road. An evacuation center is housed at the Window Rock Fighting Scouts Event Center on Navajo Route 12 south of Window Rock High School.
According to Nygren, 23 people sought shelter at the events center on Monday morning.
The fire is the biggest on the Navajo Nation since June 2020, according to a Source review of National Interagency Fire Center records, and is already the second-biggest in more than a decade. The biggest fire, the Wood Springs 2 Fire, burned about 20 miles north of the Oak Springs Fire, consuming more than 12,000 acres.
Crews assigned to the Oak Springs fire are prioritizing protecting the town of Saint Michaels, the corridor along highway 12, including homes and pipelines.
A public meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Monday night at the Fighting Scouts Field House, according to a news release. It will also be streamed on this Facebook page.

Mike DeWine to veto provisions in the GOP-passed state budget that they say would “destroy” them. Amid cuts to their expected funding, levies are being restricted from making the ballot.
School districts are scrambling to fight against the $60 billion operating bill.
“All signs lead one to believe that the real plan is to destroy public education in Ohio in this budget,” Cleveland Heights-University Heights City School District Board Member Dan Heintz said.
Public schools are facing hundreds of millions of cuts to expected school funding. Plus, the state wants to take away some of their savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and refunding to taxpayers anything above that.
Districts will be left with two bad choices to make up the lost funds, Heints said.
“It will either come, again, from local taxpayers in the form of more and — let’s be honest — constant levies or it will not come,” he added. “Public school districts will be required to cut and cut and cut and cut until there is nothing left.”
House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said these changes are necessary since homeowners are struggling with property taxes skyrocketing.
“Not only do we have immediate tax relief, we have a new system that eliminates the ability for levies that go on, an emergency levy that never [goes] away,” Huffman said.
Also under the budget, access to the ballot will be even more difficult. Districts will no longer be able to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
The bill eliminates levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it prohibits them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
It also prohibits a school district from submitting any current expense levy to voters if it has a general fund carry-over balance of more than 100% of general fund expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. It excludes renewal levies, though.
Even if voters pass a new school levy, the bill allows county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
“If their state of desperation, if that’s what you would call it, can be properly conveyed to the voters in their district, and if it is desperate, I think voters will get that,” the speaker said, adding that some schools won’t see a reduction in funding compared to last year.
Schools need to prove they need the money, which Heintz said he understands — but that levy fatigue is real.
“He’s forcing us into a situation where we will have to go to voters every 2 years and that’s just too much to ask,” the board member said. “It’s too much of a burden.”
Instead of focusing on the mission of the schools, the district and families have to spend time considering a levy campaign, or the superintendent needs to worry about cutting extracurriculars or teachers, he said.
Huffman argued that voters should have all the choices possible since it is their money.
“The best economic decisions get made in a household,” he said.
Heintz and the public school districts are left with one final plea.
“Governor, you have an opportunity to secure your place as one of Ohio’s greatest governors, and the place to begin to be remembered is with the youngest Ohioans,” he said, speaking directly to the governor through our interview. “With a stroke of a pen, you can make it right.”
It’s expected Gov. Mike DeWine will sign the budget and issue his line-item vetoes ahead of the deadline Tuesday.

He said he is also joining the board of an unnamed Second Amendment advocacy organization and moving his firearms training business, Team America Tactical, to Arizona. Armagost is one of the staunchest gun rights advocates in the Legislature. He formed the Second Amendment Caucus last summer, and he sponsored successful legislation this year to felonize all firearm thefts.
He also brought a resolution in 2024 to impeach Secretary of State Jena Griswold after she supported the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove President Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballot.
Armagost was first elected to the Legislature in 2022.
“It has been a privilege to serve with Representative Armagost. His knowledge with regard to law enforcement and public safety made him a tremendous asset to our caucus,” House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese said in a statement. “He will certainly be missed, and I wish him all the best in future endeavors.”
Armagost is the second lawmaker to step down following this year’s regular legislative session. Former Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen resigned earlier this month.
A vacancy committee of Republican voters in House District 64 will choose Armagost’s replacement.

Susan Collins (R-ME) talks with reporters following votes at the Capitol on February 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)“What will Sen. Susan Collins do?” is a question that is once again at the forefront of many political watchers’ minds.
The Senate is in the midst of debating Republicans’ “big, beautiful” reconciliation package, which foists food assistance costs onto states, includes $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid as well as new taxes on renewable energy projects, and will add roughly $3.3  trillion to the national deficit over 10 years, all to pay for an extension of the tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term as well as a dramatic expansion of federal immigration deportation activities.
Just as with the 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Collins cast a decisive vote against, along with Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, we are in an every-vote-counts moment.
Throughout the negotiation process, Collins has expressed concern about the impact the bill would have on rural hospitals and on some Medicaid recipients, though she does support adding work requirements to the low-income health care program. On Saturday, she voted along with the majority of Republicans to begin debate on the package but said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”
She said she would be filing “a number of amendments,” during the vote-a-rama process, which is expected to last throughout the day Monday with a final Senate vote on Tuesday.
One of those amendments, released Monday, would create a new 39.6% tax bracket for individuals earning more than $25 million and joint filers earning over $50 million and use that to double the proposed $25 billion relief fund for rural hospitals likely to be impacted by the Medicaid cuts as well as changes to state taxes on health providers.
The senator’s office did not say whether she will still vote for the bill if her amendments do not pass.
Collins, who will be on the ballot again in 2026, won her last reelection on a campaign promise that she would use her seniority and authority as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee to deliver for Mainers. 
It is not at all clear how this legislation, even with this proposed tax on the ultra wealthy, does that, given the sheer size and scope of the cuts on the table. In a letter sent last week, Gov. Janet Mills warned Collins and other members of Maine’s congressional delegation that “states like Maine do not have the financial resources to absorb cuts of this magnitude.”
Particularly pointing to proposed federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Mills wrote that if enacted “these measures will eliminate vital support from thousands of families, children, and seniors across Maine, strain the finances of state and local governments, destabilize safety net programs for vulnerable populations, and seriously harm our economy.”
After announcing he would not seek re-election, Collins’ colleague, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, took the Senate floor Sunday night to warn that the current bill would “hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.” Tillis encouraged other senators to eschew the self-imposed July 4 deadline and “take the time to get this right.”
“We owe it to the states to do the work to understand how these proposals affect them,” Tillis said.
Collins also seems to know that passing this bill will be devastating for her state. But the distance between knowing and doing is vast. 
Mainers have been here before — with the weight of substantial federal upheaval seemingly resting on the shoulders of our sole Republican representative. It’s not only reminiscent of the Affordable Care Act vote, but also those times she did not go against the grain, such as the 2018 confirmation vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (when Collins said she was assured he was committed to precedent on Roe), and in 2020 when Collins voted against Trump’s impeachment because she believed he learned “a pretty big lesson.” 
I wonder if, after her previous acquiescence to the Trump administration, Collins has learned her lesson.
Sure, Collins has the power to get an amendment passed, but she can also stop this train wreck, or like Tillis encourage her colleagues to go back to the drawing board, because the impacts of this one vote are likely to be felt for years to come.

These include a ban on certain vaping products, changes to automotive insurance policies, and transportation commerce tax.
Here’s a look at a few and what they mean for North Carolinians.
Vape ban

	
Then-Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill regulating the access of “alternative nicotine products” for youth during the North Carolina General Assembly’s previous session.
The regulation’s wording specifically targets products that aren’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration, describing alternative nicotine products as ones containing nicotine but not tobacco, and are intended for human consumption.
The law technically went into effect on May 1, but includes a 60-day grace period (see page 8). This offers retailers time to adjust after the Department of Revenue publishes the name of approved vape products on its Vapor Certification Directory.
Several were certified May 1, while others were not certified until May 29. It is unlawful for stores to sell products that don’t appear on the list.
There is, however, a loophole. Companies are able to apply for premarket approval and sell their items prior to receiving a decision from the FDA.
Automobile insurance policies

	
North Carolina drivers could see increased insurance premiums due to policy changes taking effect on Tuesday.
At the moment, insurance policies are required to cover minimum liability limits of $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident for bodily injury, as well as $25,000 per accident for property damage, according to the North Carolina Department of Insurance.
A new law will require an increase in minimum limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. The minimum limits for property damage will go up to $50,000.
There will also be an inexperienced operator surcharge for drivers with less than eight years of experience, a raise from the current standard of less than three years of experience. This will only apply to drivers who are first licensed on or after July 1.
The surcharges for years four through eight will be less than surcharges for years one through three, and the new surcharges will gradually lower as the years of driving experience increase.
Transportation commerce tax

	
North Carolina residents can expect higher bills on ride share services and taxis.
A new law implements transportation commerce tax, which is placed on the gross receipts from for-hire ground transport service, according to the North Carolina Department of Revenue. This includes the trip fare, booking fees, surcharges, fuel charges, cleaning fees, and wait time fees.
The tax is due as long as the passenger boards the vehicle, regardless of if the service is completed.
Exclusive ride services — one where an individual or group requests a ride to a destination without being matched with other passengers by the transportation network company, which would result in a single fare paid by the party — would charge a 1.5% tax rate while there’s a 1% tax rate for shared ride services.
For shared ride services, the transportation network company would connect a passenger with another passenger along the planned route. Each separate rider or party would pay a separate fare.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1688-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 14:05:32.181588

“What will happen is you bring people in there,” DeSantis said during a press conference in The Villages, where he signed the new state budget. “They ain’t going anywhere once they’re there, unless you want them to go somewhere, because good luck getting to civilization.”
The president is “very excited” about authorizing the National Guards to act as immigration judges, an idea the DeSantis administration has been publicly pushing for since March, DeSantis said. But the governor also criticized other states’ lack of action in helping Trump realize his campaign promise of mass deportations.
A federal judge could issue an order to stop the opening of the Everglades detention center following a request for emergency intervention from environmental groups suing state, local, and federal entities over concern about damage to the delicate ecosystem of more than 96% wetlands.
Ongoing protests against the immigration detention center are scheduled to take place Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
“We would not have agreed to do it at that site if I thought that somehow it was going to negatively impact all the great work we’ve done on improving and restoring the Everglades,” DeSantis said.
The detention center is at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport, where environmental concerns led to cancellation of a planned massive jetport during the late 1960s. According to the airport’s website, roughly 900 acres of the 24,960-acre property has been developed.
DeSantis said waste from the site would be self-contained and transported out of it.

It's already the second-biggest fire on the Navajo Nation in more than a decade, according to a Source review. (Photo courtesy Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren's Facebook page)A wildfire that erupted over the weekend on the Navajo Nation near the New Mexico border has grown to more than 6,200 acres, according to the latest updates. 
The Oak Springs fire began Saturday a few miles southwest of Saint Michaels, Ariz. and cast smoke throughout much of the area over the weekend, including nearby Gallup. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, in updates posted on social media, said wood haulers in the area may have started the fire, though its cause is still officially under investigation. 
More than 400 people have responded to the fast-growing wildfire, which is 0% contained. On Monday, in response to the rapid fire spread, a complex incident management team took over the fire, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
The Navajo Nation is ordering people in Hunter’s Point and Oak Springs west of mile marker 12 on Navajo Route 12 to flee, along with Saint Michaels’ residents along roads 603, 604, 605 and Navajo Telecommunications Road. An evacuation center is housed at the Window Rock Fighting Scouts Event Center on Navajo Route 12 south of Window Rock High School.
According to Nygren, 23 people sought shelter at the events center on Monday morning. 
The fire is the biggest on the Navajo Nation since June 2020, according to a Source review of National Interagency Fire Center records, and is already the second-biggest in more than a decade. The biggest fire, the Wood Springs 2 Fire, burned about 20 miles north of the Oak Springs Fire, consuming more than 12,000 acres. 
Crews assigned to the Oak Springs fire are prioritizing protecting the town of Saint Michaels, the corridor along highway 12, including homes and pipelines. 
A public meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Monday night at the Fighting Scouts Field House, according to a news release.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Brad Little ordered flags to be lowered at half-staff. 
Multiple firefighters shot, killed while responding to North Idaho brush fire; suspect found dead

The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled. 
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
As the U.S. Senate worked early Monday to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”

U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said. 
In updates Sunday evening, Kootenai County law enforcement officials said a dead man with a rifle was located nearby on Canfield Mountain, near where the fire was reported earlier in the day. Late Sunday, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said law enforcement believe the shooter suspect started the fire, describing the event as an ambush.
The injured firefighter faced a critical injury, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post at 10 a.m. Monday Mountain time. But he was in stable condition, local Sheriff Norris said late Sunday. More specific information about his condition and identity has not been released.

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, was still burning late Sunday because the active shooter situation delayed firefighting efforts. The fire was estimated to be 15-20 acres by the Idaho Department of Lands in an update at 10 p.m. Pacific time Sunday. The fire’s cause remained under investigation. 
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post at 10:24 a.m. Mountain time. 
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”

In a moment that demands clarity, collaboration and courage, too many of our most visible Black leaders are caught in performative conflicts that trade strategy for spectacle. From city government to the county commission, from the Capitol to the sanctuary, we’re witnessing a crisis not just of policy but of purpose. And Black people in Memphis are paying the price.
Black leaders in Memphis are clashing over what liberation looks like spiritually, economically, and environmentally. The deeper issue may not be the conflict itself but the way we’re engaging it. If we’re not intentional, our disagreements can distract from our collective purpose and diminish the trust our communities place in us.
Take the escalating tensions surrounding xAI’s controversial development in South Memphis. Billionaire Elon Musk’s tech company is constructing a massive supercomputer facility in one of the most disinvested, environmentally burdened Black communities in the city. While Mayor Paul Young has leaned into economic development messaging, Rep. Justin Pearson has sounded the alarm about public health risks and procedural failures, even as organizations like the NAACP prepare to sue.
Yes, there have been public meetings and forums held by advocates for xAI — Young and the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce — and by those concerned by it. I’ve attended some of them. I’ve spoken directly with both organizations. But symbolic appearances are not the same as substantive collaboration. The longer this divide festers in the public eye without coordination, the easier it becomes for corporate interests to exploit the cracks in our collective leadership.
The county budget fight shows a similar pattern. Earlier this week, the Shelby County Commission approved a nearly $2 billion budget with no increase in the property tax rate, a move praised as “fiscally responsible” by County Mayor Lee Harris. But critics like Commissioner Charlie Caswell and several community coalitions have rightfully questioned how so-called “austerity” politics serve the very people who are most harmed by underfunded services, neglected infrastructure, and stagnant wages. 
This isn’t just about spreadsheets. It’s about values. Flat taxes mean flat services. And in communities already flattened by disinvestment, that’s not neutral. That’s negligent.
Then there’s the spiritual arena, a realm that should model moral clarity but often mirrors the same divisiveness. Some of our most well-established Black denominational institutions — including the National Baptist Convention, USA, the National Missionary Baptist Convention of America and the Church of God in Christ — have aligned themselves with corporate partners like Target, accepting funding under the banner of progress, while simultaneously side-stepping grassroots protestors, organizers and younger clergy who have kept the moral fires of justice lit in the streets.
We cannot afford to be this divided, not now, not ever. And we especially cannot afford to confuse:

Personal platform-building, which often centers ego over equity’
Prophetic work, which risks popularity for the sake of truth’
Public witness, which calls power to account with transparency’
Political pragmatism, which should never become an excuse for moral compromise.

Let me be clear. I’m not critiquing from the sidelines. I’ve been in conversation with Young and Pearson. I’ve shared meals, attended meetings, and extended invitations to work through these tensions in ways that are principled and people-centered. The exception is Harris. I’m still working to set up a meeting with him.
What worries me most is how these feuds are beginning to calcify, not around ideas, but around identities. We’re slipping into factionalism. Into camps. Into cults of personality. And while we subtweet each other and swap shade in interviews, Black communities continue to suffer under systems that do not pause while we figure out how to play nice.
This isn’t just about unity for unity’s sake. This is about the utility of our power. It’s about whether we are capable of moving together with enough alignment and enough discipline to shift policy, redistribute resources, and dismantle systems of harm. That’s the work. That’s the call.
Family feuds are fine for entertainment. But for Black freedom? They’re a death sentence.

The lawsuit, filed quietly by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission on June 27, alleges that Shepard violated the state Governmental Conduct Act, which regulates how employees at all levels of New Mexico government comport themselves. It raises concerns about many of the expenditures first reported in 2023 by Searchlight New Mexico, including nearly $28,000 on exotic furniture from Seret and Sons in Santa Fe.


This article first appeared on Searchlight New Mexico and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.


But it also reveals previously undisclosed spending by alleging that he took “at least $177,404.83” in funding meant for an ADA-compliant ramp and walkway and instead spent it on a patio to host events that were part of his daughter’s wedding in May of that year. It accuses him of directing employees to say that the flowers he bought for the wedding were actually meant for use during graduation ceremonies and that “no one will know the difference.”
“As WNMU President, Shepard had a practice of authorizing university expenditures from which he benefited that were only loosely connected to university purposes,” the 106-page lawsuit alleges. “While a university president has wide latitude to authorize university expenditures for university purposes, the Governmental Conduct Act places a limit on the expenditure of public funds for a private purpose. Shepard transgressed that limit.”
In early November 2022, then-WNMU Capital Projects Director Joseph Holguin was in communication with a contractor about the ADA-compliant ramp project, the lawsuit states. On Nov. 12, 2022, Shepard learned that his daughter was engaged; within weeks, the lawsuit alleges, he began sending her videos of the campus, touting it as a potential wedding venue.
“In one video, Shepard walks through phase one of the capital project, saying that a patio expansion near to the … property would be done in time for the wedding, suggesting the area as a potential venue for wedding related events, and conveying that hosting the wedding at WNMU would cost his daughter nothing,” the lawsuit says. “It would cost WNMU and the public, however.”

In early December 2022, the Shepard family “canceled wedding-related reservations in Arizona, and Shepard planned that WNMU would be the venue for at least some wedding-related events,” the lawsuit alleges.
That same month, Holguin learned that the contractor working on the walkway and ramp couldn’t complete the final phase of the project for less than $300,000. “The $300,000 threshold is significant, because the staff of New Mexico’s Higher Education Department must approve any alterations to university capital projects or site improvements costing over $300,000,” the State Ethics Commission said in its court filing. Holguin was then “directed to reduce the scope of the project to the sidewalk connecting a driveway to the extant patio and a retaining wall to protect the sidewalk from erosion. Yet, not long after that direction, the scope of the capital project grew to include not only a walkway but also an extended patio adjacent to the … property for the purpose of hosting wedding-related events.”
Email correspondence at the time shows Holguin raising concerns that the contractor’s quoted price for the ADA-compliant ramp had increased along with the scope of the job. “Add of change order for irrigation and added electrical scope,” he wrote in a 2022 email to Shepard. “Over 300K … I am not confident we are in a good place to move forward with the number of revised proposals.”
Not long after, Shepard began calling Holguin nearly every day. At one point, the lawsuit says, Shepard insisted that this project be hurried up “because he [Shepard] only had one daughter.”
“On several occasions I personally saw or experienced Dr. Joseph Shepard, then-president of the university, misusing the resources of the university, including employee time,” Holguin is quoted as saying in the lawsuit.
As university president, Shepard lived in an on-campus house. The construction project connected his home to an adjacent building with a large brick walkway and patio. On June 28, the lushly landscaped patio was decorated with overhead bistro lights, fire pits, umbrellas and cushioned patio furniture.

  The patio Shepard’s daughter used for her wedding reception.
As the project progressed, Shepard allegedly “micromanaged” the construction, “including grading changes, utility line adjustments, custom landscaping, and new brickwork — all of which incurred additional costs and further departed from the original ADA-focused plan.” All of this allegedly led to several “sewer breaks” and depleted the university’s inventory of bricks, leading to more purchase orders and more strain on public coffers, the State Ethics Commission claimed.
Despite the delays allegedly caused by micromanagement, the construction was completed in time for the wedding. Emails between Holguin and Kelly Riddle, the university vice president of business and finance, show him fretting about the timeline.
“The site grading changes he made earlier in the day resulted in numerous sewer breaks; this morning, our team is onsite making repairs and lowering the gas line. Additionally, I am concerned that we cannot get the additional concrete. Other jobs are pulling trucks from Deming and Las Cruces,” Holguin wrote to Riddle in April 2023. “There is the possibility we may not have this work done by graduation. However, I am confident everything will be completed for the wedding reception.”
All of this, the State Ethics Commission argues, fits a pattern of Shepard using public dollars for private enjoyment — while finding tenuous connections to the university’s betterment to justify the purchases.
“With respect to the wedding and the patio, Shepard continued the practice of identifying ostensible WNMU purposes to justify expenditures of public funds that were, in fact, intended for a private benefit,” the filing says. “During a meeting with WNMU staff about the wedding, Shepard told WNMU staff members that if anything Shepard purchased for the wedding could be used for university fundraising, he should not have to pay for it.”
His daughter’s wedding invitation and schedule — which features a photo of the couple in front of what appears to be the base of the Superstition Mountains as seen at Lost Dutchman State Park in Apache Junction, Arizona — directs guests to park near Shepard’s residence for the festivities. “Yes,” the invitation reads, “it does show as ‘President’s Residence’ on Google Maps haha.”
The itinerary shows the patio would get a lot of use over the course of the weekend. “This event will be outdoors so bring layers if it gets chilly!” it instructed guests. “We’re planning for a food truck dinner, fire pit and dancing/casual hanging out. If you own cowboy boots, this maaaay be a fantastic time to plan an outfit around them.”
Shepard did not respond to a request for comment.
Shepard-lawsuit
 
After Shepard resigned from his post in December, Searchlight reported, he and his wife, former CIA agent-turned-author Valerie Plame, bought a former wedding venue in Embudo, between Santa Fe and Taos. The terms of Shepard’s departure granted him a $1.9 million severance payment and a new teaching job as a tenured professor with an annual salary of $200,000.
The State Ethics Commission’s suit is the latest action taken against the former WNMU president. In January, Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against him and the university Board of Regents — all of whom have since left their posts — and seeks to claw back the $1.9 million severance payment Shepard received upon leaving the job. Shepard has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but Judge Jarod K. Hofacket has not yet issued a ruling.
The commission opened its investigation into Shepard in November, after the Office of the State Auditor released a scathing report that accused WNMU leaders of improperly spending more than $360,000. Its lawsuit seeks a $250 payment from Shepard for each confirmed violation of the Governmental Conduct Act (capped at $5,000) and for him to pay restitution to WNMU for the construction of the patio.
As for the ramp that was supposed to be built in compliance with the ADA, a law that’s been on the books since 1990, authorities say it’s still nowhere to be found.
“Upon information and belief, WNMU has yet to construct an ADA-compliant ramp for the … property, as originally intended in phase two of the construction project,” Friday’s lawsuit says.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joseph-Shepard-patio-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 13:08:15.336950

(Joshua Haiar/SD Searchlight)Dusty Johnson will run for governor of South Dakota next year, he confirmed Monday during a campaign event in Sioux Falls.
The announcement was a formality after Johnson was widely rumored to be a candidate and said last week that he planned to make a political announcement Monday.
The 48-year-old Johnson, a Republican and married father of three from Mitchell, currently serves as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He said in a press release Monday morning that it’s been “the honor of my lifetime” to serve in Congress, “but it’s time for a new chapter — a chapter that drives South Dakota to a brighter future where we build better schools and safer communities, a chapter that governs with conservative principles to create new jobs, new businesses, and new opportunities in every community, and a chapter where being a workhorse, not a show horse, still means something.”
Johnson is serving his fourth term in Congress. He previously worked as an executive of Mitchell-based telecommunications company Vantage Point Solutions from 2014 to 2018, as chief of staff to then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard from 2011 to 2014, and as an elected member of the state Public Utilities Commission from 2004 to 2011.

Gov. Kristi Noem resigned earlier this year to become secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in President Donald Trump’s administration. Her lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, succeeded her and is serving the remainder of her term through next year. Rhoden has not announced whether he will be a candidate to keep the job.
Two other men have already declared their candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor: state House Speaker Jon Hansen and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. Republican voters will pick their nominee in the June 2, 2026, primary election.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old college student Robert Arnold has announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor.
Johnson’s decision to run for governor will open up his seat in the U.S. House. Last week, Republican state Attorney General Marty Jackley said he plans to seek that office next year, which will create an open race next year for attorney general.
Other major offices up for election next year in South Dakota include the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds, who is expected to seek reelection. Democratic businessman and former state trooper Julian Beaudion is seeking his party’s nomination to challenge Rounds. Brian Bengs, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against U.S. Sen. John Thune in 2022, has said he will run as an independent next year against Rounds.

MDEQ put the warning in place on June 5 after third-party utility JXN Water notified the agency of a “catastrophic” sewer failure at the critical West Bank Interceptor.
“Recent samples of the Pearl River, within the area of the extended advisory, indicate the impact of the untreated sewage has subsided and sample results have returned to pre-incident levels,” the agency said in a June 27 press release.
A 2019 advisory for the river, which runs from Hanging Moss Creek in the northern tip of Hinds County to the Byram Swinging Bridge, is still active. It warns the public against swimming, wading, or fishing in the water because of “ongoing sanitary sewer overflows around the City of Jackson.”
JXN Water discovered the most recent failure on May 28. The malfunction led to the release of between 10 million to 20 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Peal River each day, according to MDEQ. JXN Water stopped the overflow on June 6, nine days after discovering the issue.
The utility estimated it is spending $300,000 a month to redirect the wastewater through 4,000 feet of piping, and will need $7.5 million for long-term repairs.

Ethics complaints filed with the Vermont Senate against Sens. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, and Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, allege they used their positions on a critical committee negotiating the final form of a wide-ranging education bill to advance provisions that benefited the private schools they are associated with.
Beck, the Senate minority leader, is employed as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy. Bongartz, the chair of the Senate Education Committee, served almost two decades on the board of Burr and Burton Academy, and has done paid consulting work for the Maple Street School in Manchester.
The complaints, filed with the Senate’s Ethics Committee by Friends of Vermont Public Education board member Geo Honigford, allege that both senators violated ethical standards set forth in state law by negotiating this session’s major education reform bill in a committee of conference — which was charged with reconciling differences in the House and Senate versions — despite their associations with private schools, called independent schools in state law.
The Legislature passed the bill June 16, and Gov. Phil Scott is expected to sign it into law Tuesday.
Honigford, in an email to Senate Ethics Committee members, wrote that the two senators “used their positions to advance provisions that directly benefited the schools they are associated with.”
“I believe this crossed a line,” Honigford wrote. “Vermonters should be able to trust that lawmakers are working in the public interest, not using their influence to benefit their employers or clients.”
Beck, in a phone interview, brushed aside the alleged conflict, saying that “every senator has a connection to their school districts, to their schools.”
“They’re going to advocate for their schools. I would expect nothing less,” Beck said. “That’s what we’re supposed to do. We’re supposed to represent and advocate for our area. I’m no different than that.”
“I do happen to work at a school, but there are other people in the Legislature that work in schools, and we defend our schools and we defend our districts and our towns that make up those districts,” Beck added.
Bongartz, meanwhile, in a phone interview, called the complaint filed against him “complete garbage” and an “amateurish attempt at intimidation.”
“I just think that bringing this level of attempted intimidation to Vermont politics is something I thought I’d never see in this state,” he said. “This is just beyond the pale and completely baseless.”
He added that the “problem is that I understand independent schools, I understand the critical role they play in the areas they serve, and they don’t like that.”
“They don’t like the fact that I’m an articulate voice for something that they don’t like,” he said.
Earlier this month, Bongartz, Beck, Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, and three House members served on the Committee of Conference that shaped the final contours of H.454, the landmark education reform bill set to transform the state’s public education system.
Among its many components, the bill set new limits on which independent schools would remain eligible to receive public funding in the future and how much they would be able to charge. 
The final version of the bill requires that a task force set to craft new school district boundaries include at least one option that maintains the current supervisory union and supervisory district administrative structure, which would support the continuation of historic tuitioning arrangements with independent schools.
In a press release announcing the ethics complaints, the Friends of Vermont Public Education alleged that both senators either fought against, or advocated for, changes that would benefit the independent schools they work for.
Bongartz, for instance, fought to set the threshold for public tuition eligibility for independent schools at 25%, “a number many observers couldn’t explain,” the release said.
“It turns out Maple Street School, one of his clients, has 33% of its students publicly funded. A higher threshold, like the 51% number proposed by the House, would have cut off their public dollars,” the group alleged in their press release. “The lower threshold preserved them.”
Beck, meanwhile, pushed for increased funding for independent career and technical education centers and high schools, including a provision allowing independent schools like St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndonville Institute — which operate such centers — to set their own tuition rates for public school districts who send students there, according to their release. 
No similar language applies to public high schools with career and technical education centers in the bill, though the legislation does not specifically address how the amount paid to them will be set. Legislators plan to take on that task during the 2026 session.
“St. Johnsbury Academy stands to lose significant taxpayer support under the bill’s new funding formula,” the release reads. “Beck’s efforts helped insert carve-outs and funding increases that will cushion that impact and protect the school’s revenue.”
Beck downplayed that allegation, saying that he was simply “advocating for the status quo.” 
Public and independent career and technical education programs in Vermont are allowed to set their own tuition rates, he said.
“If I had gone in and tried to get something new, like some special good deal for St. Johnsbury Academy, maybe that would be a different story,” he said. “But, effectively, all I was advocating for is the status quo, which is that they get to be able to set their tuition as a CTE center, just like a public school CTE does.”

“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
Living longer
People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
Uncertain grants
Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help to shore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
Skipping pills
In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A dozen members of Florida’s Republican congressional delegation announced Monday morning that they support the GOP-written economic and domestic policy bill dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and urged their colleagues to do likewise.
The U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the bill later on Monday. If approved,  it would bounce back to the U.S. House for consideration. Republicans aim to place the bill in front of President Trump by July 4.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will lower taxes for hardworking families, seniors and small businesses, protect Medicaid and strengthen America’s border security,” their letter reads. “We are committed to seeing this bill become law on behalf of all Floridians.”
Signing the letter were Aaron Bean, Vern Buchanan, Byron Donalds, Neal Dunn, Randy Fine, Carlos Giménez, Mike Haridopolos, Laurel Lee, Anna Paulina Luna, Brian Mast, Jimmy Patronis, and Daniel Webster.
Eight Florida House Republicans did not. They are Kat Cammack, Maria Elvira Salazar, Mario Diaz-Balart, Gus Bilirakis, Scott Franklin, Cory Mills, John Rutherford, and Greg Steube.
Medicaid cuts
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has said that the Senate bill would cut more than $930 billion from Medicaid. But the Florida congressional Republicans say in their letter that the bill is “protecting and strengthening for American citizens who need it by rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, and implementing common sense work requirements.”
Florida Sen. Rick Scott and several other GOP members of the Senate announced on Sunday that they are introducing an amendment that would end the existing system under which the federal government pays 90% of the costs in states that have expanded Medicaid based on the Affordable Care Act.
Beneficiaries enrolled before Dec. 31, 2030, would be grandfathered in at the existing rate, but new enrollees would see their medical costs reimbursed at the lower Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, which could be as low as 50%. The CBO says that the amendment, if passed, would save an additional $313 billion in federal spending, according to The Hill.
“Critics of the bill’s Medicaid fixes fail to mention the millions of able-bodied adults who access Medicaid while refusing to work,” the Florida Republicans assert in their letter.
“Through the Affordable Care Act, Democrats expanded Medicaid eligibility to include any adult earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level and below. Florida has not opted to expand Medicaid to this population. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that less than $1.5 billion of federal Medicaid dollars are spent on childless, non-working, able-bodied adults in Florida — less than in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, Michigan and Arizona.
“This means that Floridians’ federal tax dollars are subsidizing Medicaid for able-bodied adults in less populous, Democrat-run states. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act institutes common-sense work requirements that will increase labor participation and reserve Medicaid dollars for those who need them most: the elderly, pregnant women, pregnant women, disabled Americans and needy children.”
The Florida Republicans in their letter also highlight provisions that would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay for low- and medium-wage workers.
“Over 193,000 workers across the Sunshine State are employed as restaurant servers, making Florida one of the states with the highest employment level of waiters and waitresses,” the letter reads.
“Tips account for approximately 21.3 percent of Florida restaurant workers’ incomes, meaning these workers depend heavily on customer generosity and see significant unpredictability in their earnings. Similarly, Floridians who receive overtime pay, including our brave men and women in law enforcement, go above-and-beyond every day to make ends meet. Exempting tips and overtime pay from federal income tax will bring financial stability to hundreds of thousands of Floridians.”
Polls show opposition to the legislation
All members of the Florida Democratic congressional legislative delegation opposed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” when it came before the House on May 22. They all are expected to oppose it again if the Senate passes its version of the bill this week.
The legislation is viewed unfavorably by 64% of Americans, according to a KFF health tracking poll of 1,321 adults conducted June 4-8, with a margin for error of three percentage points.
Another survey conducted by Fox News of 1,003 registered voters found that 59% oppose the bill with just 38% supporting it. That survey was conducted between June 13-16.

The VA announced in March that it would no longer cover gender affirming care for trans servicemembers or vets, but that people who were already receiving the medicine would continue to.
Army veteran Jane Doe was one of the people who had been getting the meds for years. WSHU has granted her anonymity due to her fear of retaliation from the Defense Department.
When she went to refill her prescription, Doe’s pharmacy told her her insurance no longer paid for her medication. She appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals, but didn’t hear back, so she sued the VA. Within a month of the lawsuit, the VA acknowledged it had made a mistake in removing Doe’s coverage.
“Having dealt with government as closely as I have over so many years in the military, I never expected them to just so quickly be like, ‘Yes, we were wrong,’ and walk away and grant the request,” Doe said.
Doe’s lawyer, Hillary Browning from the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School, said systemic safeguards have to be put in place to keep this from happening again.
“Our hope is that they sort of learn their lesson, and if they didn’t learn their lesson, they see that there are veterans out there who are willing to hold them to the policies that they’ve put in place,” Browning said.
Doe and her legal team say they don’t know why the decision was made so fast. But Doe said it shows that the uphill battle was worth it.
“Just because the government is a Goliath doesn’t mean that David doesn’t win sometimes.”
The VA was invited to participate in this story, but the request was declined.

View and rate the answers from Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, whose two-term administration ends Tuesday.","Q: Why are there so many traffic lights out in the city?
A: Aging infrastructure, vehicle collisions and arsonists.
Q: Where do I go if I want to get a pothole fixed?
A: Call 311.
Q: Why do you hate white people?
A: I do not hate white people.


These are some of the questions folks had recently for outgoing Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba – and his answers.
In 2024, Lumumba began an initiative called “Ask Antar,” in which residents could submit inquiries and concerns through the city’s website.
The city received more than 180 questions. Mississippi Today requested and reviewed them all and found that in the last year, Jacksonians have had the most curiosity and frustration about accessing services and responsiveness from City Hall, housing and homelessness, and street conditions.
Lumumba, whose two-term administration ends Tuesday, responded to about a fourth of the questions, plus more submitted through social media, across 15 video segments on the city’s YouTube page. In many videos, the mayor explained processes – such as how environmental courts determine what to do about derelict structures or why Jackson Police Department is unable to address squatting unless it receives a report from the owner of a specific property.
Another theme among his answers was that the administration is not in control of all functions people had complaints about – like in the case of water rates now governed by private manager JXN Water, or street lights on interstates that are a state responsibility. He also said the administration did not have resources to address all problems – potholes, for example.
Mississippi Today went a step further, contacting people who submitted questions. Of the two dozen who responded to the news organization, most had no idea the mayor had answered their questions.
“Why is it you replied to my email, yet I never heard from the city of Jackson?” said one person, who had asked in December about the broken stop light at the intersection of Woodrow Wilson and State Street.
For those whose questions Lumumba answered, we directed each person to the corresponding video and asked them to rate their satisfaction with the answer on a scale of 1 to 5.

Mississippi Today requested an interview with Lumumba to discuss our findings, but city spokesperson Melissa Payne said he was unavailable. Lumumba lost reelection during the April Democratic primary and was working on transitioning out of office to make way for Mayor-elect John Horhn. Lumumba’s last question-and-answer segment was posted April 20, two days before he lost in the primary runoff.
Three residents made submissions to Ask Antar seeking space to hold dance classes in the city, and recent high school graduate Javion Shed asked about what the mayor is doing to combat youth violence and introduce positive activities for teens. 
“As a teen in Jackson, you’re always plagued with, what can I do on the weekends, where can I go to just relax, have a great time, and not worry about the fear of violence or the fear of someone I know getting killed?” Shed told Mississippi Today.
In response to Shed last October, Lumumba said the city was developing a curfew center, where teens who may otherwise end up at the youth detention facility could be taken instead to receive services. Shed ranked the response a “solid 4” out of 5. Amid turmoil in the city’s Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery, though, the center Lumumba described has yet to open.
Several residents raised concerns with a lack of communication and listening among the administration. Referencing a three-year fight between the mayor and city council over renewing the city’s garbage contract, which led to trash pickup interruptions in 2023, one resident wrote that the mayor’s “antics and over-complication of intent” created a “4-lane thoroughfare for justified criticism of the ability of African Americans to use critical thinking analysis, and compromise to would-be detractors.” 
Another wrote, “When you become Mayor, we become Mayor was part of your campaign slogan at one point … Why can’t you listen to the recommendations from us via our Council Person?”
Others said they were unable to reach city officials to answer questions or receive basic city services. There were inquiries about getting an electrical pole removed, about repairs to a water meter and about where to drop off old paint cans “now that the household hazardous waste dropoff is closed due to fire.”
“Why don’t the traffic office answer the phone??????” one resident wrote.
One woman who submitted a question about the federal corruption allegations against Lumumba, for which he’s pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to face trial next summer, admitted her intent was to troll the mayor.
But many more of the submissions conveyed the serious and dire conditions some Jacksonians are living in.
Last July, Carlyn Cornelius submitted concerns about the unhoused population near his mother’s house in west Jackson stealing trailers and cars, burning copper and dumping antifreeze. He told Mississippi Today that a year later, the problems remain.
In his submission, Corneluis said he’d called in reports of these activities to law enforcement, the fire department, Public Works, environmental authorities and the owner of the property, but received no help.
A few days later, another person submitted to Ask Antar, “I need a place to live. I am homeless.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30075547/ask-antar.jpg,,,2025-06-30 12:16:26.476340

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Heather Cessna is resigning as executive director of the state public defender’s office after years of warning apathetic legislators about the constitutional crisis they created by persistently underfunding her agency.
Cessna said the Legislature’s refusal to adequately support public defense work will result in criminal cases being dismissed because there are no attorneys available to represent impoverished defendants.
“It is not a question of if it will happen,” Cessna said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “It is a question of when and where. And I can tell you we are on the verge of that every single day in every jurisdiction.”


Friday was Cessna’s last day at the Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, the public defense agency she has led since October 2019. She is preparing to join the faculty at Washburn University School of Law.
Cessna has appeared annually before the Legislature to warn lawmakers of the inherent constitutional crisis they created by underfunding public defense for 30 years — while prosecutors have enjoyed unchecked power to file more and more criminal cases, she said.
Lawmakers have refused to add sufficient resources to Cessna’s budget. This year, they responded to her call to action by cutting her budget by 1.5%.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants the right to legal counsel and a speedy trial, and 84% of adult felony cases in Kansas require appointed counsel.
Cessna’s agency employees 300 workers, including defense attorneys, mitigation specialists, investigators and legal assistants. Her office also provides administrative oversight for the 350 private attorneys who are willing to be appointed to cases. Combined, they are expected to handle 30,000 criminal cases per year, Cessna said.
“One of the most frustrating parts of the legislative session this year was sitting through some of our budget hearings, where individuals who I’ve had this conversation with over and over again, who we’ve filed testimony in front of, we filed reports in front of, we’ve been very clear at every step along the way that we are in a constitutional crisis right now,” Cessna said. “And the fact that we’re holding it together with duct tape and bubble gum doesn’t mean that it’s less of a constitutional crisis.
“And yet, there were conversations during our budget hearings about how, ‘Well BIDS is not in a constitutional crisis right now. So how is the impact of this budget decision gonna put them in a constitutional crisis next year?’ And it was about all I could do to keep from coming unglued during that conversation, because I don’t know how much more clearer I could be about it.”
  Heather Cessna says public defenders in Kansas face unacceptable caseloads. “It has turned into a system where we tend to triage cases instead of actually representing people,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Her cries for help were underscored earlier this year when the Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center at Southern Methodist University in Texas released a 23-page report on the public defense crisis in Kansas. The report highlighted the “dire shortage” of public defenders, work stress caused by high caseloads, and the likelihood that the crisis is about to worsen.
The report found that public defenders in Kansas handled an average of 170 cases per year. If they worked 40 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year, they would spend an average of 12 hours on each case.
“As a result, people accused of crimes in Kansas face tough choices,” the report concluded. “Will they languish in jail, waiting for their attorney to have time to defend them? Will they consider pleading guilty despite possible defenses, risking incarceration, fines, and a loss of rights, just to put the criminal court process behind them?”
Cessna put it this way: “It has turned into a system where we tend to triage cases instead of actually representing people.”
She said the standard to provide minimally competent counsel for a low-level felony case is 33 hours per attorney. The minimal standard for a first-degree murder case would be 240 hours, she said.
“So 12 hours is absolutely a crisis, and that’s one of the reasons why we have repeatedly gone over and asked for additional staffing from the Legislature,” Cessna said. “Because the truth of the matter is we’ve got too many cases coming in to these jurisdictions, they’re being charged, and we don’t have the number of staff that we need to be able to support those caseloads.”
She said lawmakers have been unwilling to support public defense in part because “our clients are not the most popular people, and it is not usually a popular topic to add money into criminal defense.”
“Now, I will counter that by saying that the vast majority of our clients are presumed innocent, and that’s an important thing to remember when we’re talking about public defense,” Cessna said. “These are people who have not been convicted of a crime.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6260488-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-30 11:08:09.492057

Smith led the organization through a period of growth and resilience, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, while helping expand advocacy efforts and extend services to more than 42,000 clients.
“Karen’s legacy is one of strength, impact, and community,” Wicks said. “I am honored to follow in her footsteps and build upon the incredible foundation she and others have laid. As Board President, I’m committed to ensuring that our programs remain strong and that our future remains bright.”
Wicks joined the board in 2018 and has since served in several leadership roles, including Board Treasurer, Executive Board Member, and President-Elect. She brings with her an extensive background in public policy, infrastructure, and operations.
Currently the Chief Operating Officer of The Reybold Group, Wicks oversees multiple departments, including marketing, HR, and property management.
Her career includes a term as Delaware’s Secretary of Transportation and a senior policy fellowship at the University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration. In 2002, she made history as the first female Chief Engineer of DelDOT.
Wicks has received multiple accolades for her service and leadership, including Delaware Engineer of the Year, induction into the First State Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Order of the First State.
Her civic contributions also include board positions with NCC Habitat for Humanity, Pennoni Engineering, the 4-H Foundation, and the University of Delaware.
YWCA Delaware CEO Melissa Gonville praised Wicks’ appointment, citing her background in policy and operations as key to the organization’s long-term goals.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
Fate of public land dispute remains unclear as politicians cheer dismissal of ranchers’ charges

“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”

Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.










The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers


“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Lowry Barnes (Courtesy of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences)Dr. C. Lowry Barnes will become the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ interim chancellor on July 11, according to a Monday news release from the UA System. 
Barnes, a professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at UAMS, replaces Dr. Cam Patterson, who served as chancellor and UAMS Health CEO for seven years before announcing plans earlier this month to step down for personal and medical reasons. Patterson’s last day in his current role is July 10, and he will return to a faculty position in cardiology at UAMS, according to the release. 
“Dr. Barnes is a nationally known orthopaedic surgeon whose name has been synonymous with UAMS and success at that campus for many years,” UA System President Jay B. Silveria said in the release. “I trust his knowledge, passion, and leadership to steer the state’s only academic health sciences center during this time of transition.”
UAMS chancellor stepping down after 7 years, returning to faculty

The planning process for a national search for UAMS’ next chancellor is underway, and an advisory search committee was named Monday. The committee will help develop a short list of candidates for Silveria to consider before presenting his selection to the UA Board of Trustees for final approval, according to the release.
Barnes is a UAMS graduate and a fellowship-trained, board-certified orthopaedic surgeon specializing in joint reconstruction and replacement surgery of the hip and knee. He joined UAMS in 2014 as professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. In 2017, he was invested in the Carl L. Nelson, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery. 
He also serves as the director of the Musculoskeletal Service Line at UAMS Health, and is the founding director of the Orthopaedic and Spine Hospital at UAMS, which opened in 2023.
“My passion for serving patients has always extended beyond my immediate work to a drive and ambition to make UAMS and this state better places,” Barnes said in the release. “I’m honored to have been considered to take on this challenge…Working under the transformative power of the UA System, we will continue to expand our efforts to improve the health, health care and wellbeing of all Arkansans.”
The search committee will soon begin by working with a search firm to finalize a chancellor position profile and advertising the open position to open the search process, according to the release.

(Screenshot)Two firefighters have been killed and another is injured after crews in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the Coeur d’Alene hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third is being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
The injured firefighter has been released from surgery, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a 9:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday press conference. Information about his injuries or their extent was not released.
“He is fighting for his life but is in stable condition,” the sheriff said.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said. The sheriff said he believes the two incidents are related.
“We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and that it was intentional,” Norris said. “We do believe he started it, and it was totally intentional, what he did.”
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.
However, the brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Sunday night post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
Fire crews were unable to access the fire until it was deemed safe at around 7:30 p.m., the Idaho Department of Lands said in a press release.
“Crews estimate the fire to be about 15-20 acres, with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the press release says. “Additional resources including aircraft, heavy equipment, water tenders, engines, hand crews and a Type 3 Incident Management Team are on order and anticipated to work the fire tomorrow.”
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, the Department of Lands said in the release.
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”
The sheriff urged the public to wait until official information is released by law enforcement to donate to funds to benefit the victims’ families. Scammers have been known to take advantage of tragedies like this and start GoFundMe fundraising campaigns without the consent of the families, he said.
 North Idaho shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
One of the firefighters killed was from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, while the other was from the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department. The injured firefighter served the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, Norris said.
“There is a belief that (the shooter) ran and shot, so we don’t know what (evidence) we might be collecting once the fire threat diminishes,” Norris said.
Norris said the suspect’s body was removed from the scene to preserve it due to the threat of the fire.
The sheriff held two press conferences on Sunday: one at 4:30 p.m. Pacific, and one at 9:30 p.m.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris initially said law enforcement was unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers, but at the evening press conference, he said the ongoing investigation was pointing to one shooter. At the afternoon conference, he said officers and deputies were reporting from the scene that the shooter was “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Authorities are unsure whether the shooter was killed by responding officers or if he killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Norris said. He said an autopsy of the suspect’s body is scheduled in Spokane and would offer more information on how he died.
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies — an estimated 300 law enforcement officers, some from as far away as Montana — responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.
 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

Kootenai County Commission chairman Bruce Mattare said the shooting was “senseless and tragic beyond words.”
“June 29,2025, is a day that we will not forget in this community,” Mattare said at the evening press conference. “It is the day evil showed its face and we lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality, and I cannot fathom why anyone would commit such a heinous act.”
The commissioner said this kind of “senseless violence is unheard of here” and does not reflect Coeur d’Alene as a community.
“When you hear how others portray the people who live here on the news, it’s not true,” Mattare said. “What happened here decades ago is not reflective of the fine people who live here today. And I want everyone to know that this is a wonderful place to live, to raise your family and visit.”
He stressed that resources were being provided at the state and federal level to investigate the killings and fire.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.
“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Rep. Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.

The honors, awarded annually by the state’s print news association, recognize the best journalism of Mississippi’s newspapers and digital newsrooms. The 2024 prizes were announced at a Saturday luncheon in Memphis at the Tri-State Press Convention, where Mississippi’s press association joined the Tennessee and Arkansas press associations for three days of programming.
A series of Ganucheau’s 2024 editorials on the debate to expand Medicaid in Mississippi were singled out by judges as “thoughtful, accurate, and passionate.”
“If you’re not motivated to vote for Medicaid expansion by the end of each of these submissions, you haven’t read them carefully,” the judges commented. “That’s what great opinion writing should do: Take a position and argue it persuasively. Here, we get the details, the reporting and insider knowledge that provide credence to the proffered opinion … The arguments here are so well laid out and convincing that it’s hard to imagine anyone would dissent.”

With limited progress made this legislative session, it’s unclear what pathway the state has for meeting its emissions targets.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The clean heat standard is dead. What comes next?.","Vermont, the state with the lowest overall carbon emissions in the country, has become a national leader in efforts to address climate change. But this year, lawmakers were subdued about further efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. 
One reason was that the political climate had changed. 
Democrats lost more seats in Vermont than anywhere else in the country last November. The state faced multiple lawsuits against its landmark plan to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their contributions to a warming world. Gov. Phil Scott, a legion of heating fuel dealers and a media campaign run by a conservative super PAC convinced voters that the state’s plan to reduce its second largest source of fossil emissions — heating — was too expensive to be implemented. 
“Everyone knew the plan was dead the day after the election,” said Matt Cota, a member of the Public Utility Commission’s Clean Heat Technical Advisory Group that studied the proposal, known as the clean heat standard.

At the national level, fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas — the largest drivers of climate change and increasingly expensive energy sources to produce and burn — strengthened their foothold in the U.S. economy when President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. 
In Vermont, meanwhile, action on climate quieted, and perhaps the state’s most comprehensive plan under consideration to reduce emissions entered a state of limbo. The clean heat standard, half a decade in the making, would have established a wonky credit market to regulate the heating of air and water in buildings like homes and hospitals. But it was neither adopted as law nor formally repealed this legislative session. 
Instead, key lawmakers shuffled the plan into the dusty corners of committee. Advocates and lawmakers do not expect it to reemerge.
The program’s failure could leave the state with fewer options to reach the goals of the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act, which legally mandates reducing emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by the midcentury. Critics say the state already missed the first deadline, and the first lawsuit against the state has already been filed. 
Under the shadow of that deadline, why did the clean heat standard fail, and what might Vermont do next?
An incentive structure
Vermonters are among more than 10 million households, largely in New England and the Midwest, still dependent on heating fuels, like oil or propane, according to a May 2025 national report from RMI, an energy think tank. Most of the households that use heating fuels live in single-family homes and skew more rural, older and more likely to live on a fixed income.
The clean heat standard, also known as the Affordable Heat Act, was compelling because it relied on incentives. Instead of a simple tax, or fee, on heating bills, like the charge Vermonters see on their electric bills to fund efficiency programs, the program attempted to promote efficiency through a credit system.
“The first conversation was, how can we reward these heat fuel dealers performing this efficiency work, this good work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by creating an incentive structure?” Cota said.
Fuel dealers have long delivered the fossil fuels to heat individual homes through Vermont’s long winters. But these fuels and the people who distribute them are less regulated than other forms of energy like electricity. The standard would have created a registry that tracked fuel dealers and worked to help them acquire credits.

Each “clean heat credit” represented a unit of greenhouse gas emissions eliminated because of actions taken by fuel dealers. Details like how fuel dealers could earn such credits were still in the works, but the intention was to push fuel dealers to promote weatherization and more efficient heating systems like cold-weather heat pumps. Then customers could access state incentives to help pay for them. (Additional incentives of up to $2,000 for heat pumps once available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act are now on the Trump administration’s chopping block.)
Switching to more efficient heat pumps could reduce energy bills by an annual average of $990 in Vermont, according to the RMI report on heating fuels. Across the country, customers could save an average of $15,000 over the life of the heat pump. If all delivered fuels were replaced with heat pumps, the country would save nearly $8 billion in energy costs, according to the report.
But program expenses rose because of possible subsidies prioritizing low- and middle-income Vermonters. As fuel dealers looked at taking on the costs of the program, it seemed clear that some of those costs would have to be passed onto customers, according to a January report submitted by the Public Utility Commission. The kind of credit system had also never been done before, and Vermont would have had no other state’s model to rely upon, which also increased overhead costs.
“Modeling a complex sector-wide program is extremely difficult and relies on a number of assumptions that could vary widely from real-world implementation,” wrote the public utility commissioners in the January report to the Legislature. They told lawmakers their estimates should be taken as “very rough.”
Customers would pay approximately $0.08 more per gallon of fuel oil in 2026, according to the report, or about $56 for residents who bought an average of 700 gallons to heat their home. If customers continued to use fossil fuels instead of taking advantage of incentives to switch to other options, the cost could rise to $0.58 per gallon, or about $406 more by 2035 for the same amount of fuel.
For the first decade, the commission’s report estimated the program could cost the state, including those costs to customers, as much as $956 million. The commission did not recommend implementing it. 
‘They just parked it’
While that number is large, whether it’s considered affordable depends on a number of factors like how Vermonters heat their homes, the flexibility of their spending, and whether they use state incentives to lower their fossil fuel use.
But the governor took the position that the plan was unaffordable no matter what. In 2022, Scott vetoed the bill’s first version, H.715, and that veto was sustained by a single vote in the House. 
A year later, in May 2023, it became the Affordable Heat Act, or S.5, a bill that set up the clean heat standard for further study but did not implement the program. Scott again vetoed the bill, but this time he was overruled by the then Democratic supermajority in both chambers. 
That new law, Act 18, gave the Public Utility Commission and two advisory groups 18 months to figure out the details. In the 2025 legislative session, once the commission issued its January report, little action was taken. Another bill, S.65, would have repealed the clean heat standard completely but never made it out of committee.

While the commission’s final report was in development, the conservative super PAC Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers, launched a $60,000 digital and mailer campaign claiming the standard would “skyrocket” Vermonter’s utility bills and “wreak havoc on Vermonters’ wallets.”
That campaign skewed the definition of affordability and promoted misinformation, according to advocates of the law. But the Green Advocacy Project, a pro-clean heat group, contributed three times that — $180,000 — to a Vermont super PAC to boost candidates supporting the program.
But even that didn’t help incumbents like Chris Bray, the former Democratic chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy who served in the Legislature for more than a decade. He lost his November race. In early June, Bray said part of that loss had to do with the campaign against the clean heat standard. 
“The fossil fuel industry was vehemently opposed,” Bray said. “It would’ve been the country’s first assessment on fossil fuels designed to look at their emissions impact and translate that into a variable fee.” 
Bray had pushed back against the argument that the program was unaffordable. He asked lawmakers to consider not just the climate impacts but the volatile pricing of fossil fuels. During the winter of 2020 through the winter of 2023, the cost of heating oil more than doubled, according to numbers Bray compiled from the Department of Public Service and Joint Fiscal Office. 
While the governor often cited a potential $4 per gallon increase in fuel costs, far more than what the final commission report concluded. 
If he’d continued on as chair, Bray wanted to see his committee push the standard forward by working out wonky details like how much a credit would cost and how they could be obtained. But too many Democrats lost, he said, and the ones who remained were chastened by the governor’s claims that the program was unaffordable. 
“They just parked it,” Bray said of Democrats. 
There wasn’t enough movement on climate and environmental work this session because legislators were playing defense rather than going on the offensive and continuing to try and make progress, Bray added.
Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, who took over as chair of the Natural Resources and Energy Committee after Bray lost his seat, said the standard wasn’t a great fit for Vermont at this time. Because Vermont would be starting the standard from scratch, there were high overhead costs, and it would be easier if another state enacted the law first, she said.
“Nobody wanted to move forward with implementing it this session,” Watson said. But she largely blamed state leadership.

“It’s unfortunate that we’re limited by a governor who doesn’t want us to do the hard work of getting Vermonters off of expensive, price-volatile fossil fuels,” Watson said. 
At a conference in June at the University of Vermont, Lt. Gov. John Rodgers repeated these talking points, claiming that consumers, not oil companies, would have to pay for the clean heat standard. 
“Every oil company has said, ‘This is our business. If we have extra cost we have to pass it on to the consumer,’” Rodgers said in an interview afterward. “But there are people in the Legislature that are saying ‘oil companies are going to pay for it,’ and it’s just a false narrative.”
He said the Affordable Heat Act should be repealed because Vermonters couldn’t afford it. 
When asked if paying roughly $50 a year on heating oil was unaffordable — which Vermonters would pay in 2026, according to the PUC — Rodgers said he would have to go back to the report. 
“I thought it was much more than $0.08,” Rodgers said, adding that if there was a real benefit from the standard, he might consider $0.08 a gallon affordable. 
‘There isn’t currently an active plan’
As Vermont creeps toward its self-imposed, legally binding emissions deadlines, pieces of its first plan to mitigate its contribution to climate change continue to fall away. 
In 2021, a multistate pact to create a cap-and-invest program that would have reduced emissions from transportation, called the Transportation and Climate Initiative Program, crumbled. Another plan to phase out the use of gasoline-powered cars and trucks is under direct threat from the Trump administration. Now, the clean heat standard appears to be scratched off the list. 
Last Tuesday, in a courthouse in Montpelier, Vermonters began to see the first skirmishes in what could be a long, drawn-out battle if the state doesn’t come up with new ideas for meeting its goal. 
“There’s a mechanism in the Global Warming Solutions Act where there’s accountability for exactly this, where you have a governor obstinate against climate goals,” Sen. Watson said. “It’s played out in Massachusetts and maybe it needs to play out here.” 
That mechanism is a citizen lawsuit. 
Jenny Rushlow, an attorney in the clean energy and climate change program at the Conservation Law Foundation, successfully litigated that Massachusetts case. 
Now, her group is in the first stages of a suit filed against Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources, the state body in charge of implementing those reductions. The suit, filed in September 2024, alleged that the state was on track to miss the January 1, 2025, target to reduce emissions by 26% below 2005 levels. 
The agency sought to dismiss that suit, and now both parties await the judge’s decision. If he denies that motion, the Conservation Law Foundation’s case — which argues that the review was so insufficient it was rendered invalid — would proceed, according to Elena Mihaly, the vice president for the organization in Vermont, after oral arguments on the motion.

“There isn’t currently an active plan for how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the thermal sector at the level that’s required,” Rushlow said. “The clean heat standard was the focal point for reducing emissions from that sector, and it died under pressure from outside fossil fuel interests and misinformation about the cost of the program.” 
But Mihaly said no part of this lawsuit hinges on whether the clean heat standard passed, nor could a judge siding favorably with her foundation force the Legislature to pass the standard or the Agency of Natural Resources to adopt it. 
Instead, the latest focal point in the Global Warming Solutions Act is the new Climate Action Plan set to be published on July 1, which will reset the state’s priorities in reducing emissions. That plan is developed by a 23-member Climate Council legally obligated to produce the plan every four years. Now the council is considering a modified clean heat standard, according to Cota, who serves on the council.
While the clean heat standard could have been a key mechanism to help them meet the emissions goals of the Global Warming Solutions Act, “it was not ever going to be the silver bullet,” Watson said.
A leaky roof
With limited progress made this legislative session, it’s unclear what pathway the state has for meeting its emissions targets.
“When you look at what this Legislature did — or more accurately didn’t do — on climate this session as compared to the last few years, it’s a stunning reversal,” Rushlow said. “That being said, the Legislature doesn’t have a supermajority, and Gov. Scott loves to veto, particularly on issues related to the environment. So it’s completely understandable that they were not confident in their ability to make progress on climate this session.”
In lieu of meeting the state’s climate goals, Scott and fellow lawmakers have tried to cripple the Global Warming Solutions Act. During the legislative session, the House Energy and Digital Infrastructure Committee took up H.289, a bill that never made it out of committee but is intended to defang the Global Warming Solutions Act.
In March, Jared Duval, a member of the Vermont Climate Council, testified on the bill, telling lawmakers: “It is important that we remember that there are costs not just to action, but of inaction.” 
He gave an example: If you have a leak in your roof, there’s a cost to get it fixed. But the cost of damage to the roof from inaction is far greater than the cost of the repair. 
“It’s too bad, because the problem didn’t go away, but it’s just being ignored for a while,” Bray, the former lawmaker, said. “It’s just going to be more expensive to address for having put it off. But ultimately, unless we’re going to accept the idea that we’re going to destroy the planet on our watch, we’re going to have to do better.”

FELTON — Three years ago, Danielle Smith was driving through Elkton, Maryland, when she saw something that caused her to hit her brakes: a father playing with his young son on a sad excuse for a playground, all faded plastic and neglect, in a low-income apartment complex that had clearly seen better days.
For Smith, who had spent years in commercial real estate finance working for publicly traded companies, something clicked. That fleeting moment crystallized what would become her mission: creating affordable apartment communities people could be proud to call home.
“That was really the inspiration behind starting the company,” says Smith, the 35-year-old founder and sole owner of Carson Development.
Fast forward to today, and that same Elkton property has come full circle. Danielle acquired it last July and has completed a substantial rehabilitation, including a brand-new playground and basketball court. It’s a poetic closing of the loop that represents everything her company stands for.
Before launching Carson Development, Smith had climbed the ladder to become director of finance for the publicly held Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, handling acquisitions, dispositions, and financing for regional malls. Prior to that, she managed similar functions for grocery and Walmart-anchored shopping centers for the Kronke Group in Missouri.
The pivot required new thinking, especially when it came to funding a startup in a capital-intensive industry. Her advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is blunt: “However long of a runway you think you need, double it and however much capital you think you need, quadruple it, and then just hang on and you’ll be okay.”
She learned this lesson the hard way. Her initial cash projections were off by about 400%, she admits with a laugh. “Everything, if I look back to 2021 and 2022, even where I thought our projects would be, I was very wrong,” she admits with a wry laugh.
Take something as seemingly straightforward as letters of credit. “I was used to working for an organization where you could just call the bank and get an unsecured letter of credit,” Smith explains. As a small business owner, however, she suddenly needed 100% security behind every financial instrument — cash reserves she hadn’t anticipated needing.
“Things that I didn’t think would require capital all of a sudden became very large and real numbers,” she says. “That was cash that I had never foreseen being required to complete a project.”
Smith didn’t jump in blind. She created a financial three-legged stool: personal savings, a personal line of credit, and term loans from friends and family who believed in her vision. For years before taking the plunge, she moonlighted as a student of the low-income tax credit program, squirreling away money.
“Prepare. And then when you make the leap, be in a hundred percent,” she advises aspiring entrepreneurs. “Commit yourself to that. Whether that’s time with your family or a lifestyle that you once had, there’s a lot of sacrifices that go into that.”
When she finally launched Carson Development in January 2021, one of her first priorities was building the right team. By May, she’d hired experienced multi-family developer Max Friedman.
The financial high wire act nearly came crashing down when her company was closing on its first Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project in Maryland. State officials raised concerns about Carson Development’s experience and qualifications, suggesting they bring in a more established developer as a partner.
“At that point, I am all in — hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I’ve maxed out my credit line. I haven’t paid myself in two years,” Smith recalls. “I remember feeling like I could not stomach the idea of everything that I had put into this and all the hard work that my team had put in and part of our fee or control going to someone who hadn’t done anything.”
That moment crystallized her realization that her risk tolerance was higher than most. “With small-business owners, I think sometimes people forget that you personally guarantee everything and there’s a risk that goes with that,” she says.
Fortunately, they were able to close as the sole developer, but the experience was humbling. During such challenging moments, she finds strength in her company’s namesake.
“The company is named after my 5-year-old son Carson,” she says, her expression softening. “And his name on the door is what gets me through those moments that you feel pretty defeated as a business owner.”
Her company isn’t a one-trick pony. Smith’s portfolio spans both affordable housing (serving populations at 80% or below of area median income) and what she calls “workforce housing”  (serving those at 80-120% of area median income) across Delaware and Maryland. They’re juggling acquisition-rehab projects like the one in Elkton and ground-up construction like the Reese Apartments in Felton — two three-story garden-style buildings with 24 units each.
The Felton location wasn’t chosen randomly. Smith explains that Delaware State Housing Authority uses a points system for its competitive funding process and Felton sits squarely in what bureaucrats call an “area of opportunity” — essentially the state’s way of waving a flag saying “build here please.”
“We are a small company competing against more established development companies who have a lot more capital,” Smith explains. “I know that I cannot possibly fund land in some areas of New Castle County or parts of Sussex County. I would love to be able to develop in Eastern Sussex County; unfortunately we just aren’t quite there yet. But that’s not to say we won’t be there very soon.”
As a woman in a male-dominated industry, Smith has faced her share of assumptions. “The only time I really feel it is the first time I meet someone. They usually don’t realize that I own the company,” she says. “But once we start working together, it’s been pretty seamless.”
The confidence that now radiates from her didn’t materialize overnight. “First, I was very insecure about it, but now I’ve realized that that was something that was within me,” she reflects. “Being confident and knowing that we have a great team, we know what we’re doing, I deserve a seat at this table, and I’m not one to sit silently.”
What sets Smith’s approach apart from many developers is her personal involvement. She walks through every unit in properties her company acquires. She attends community events and participates in construction punch list walkthroughs.
Finding the sweet spot between big-picture vision and nitty-gritty execution remains her ongoing challenge. “We are very much still in the startup phase, and I find myself sometimes getting in the weeds,” Smith admits. “I have to remember that I need to delegate tasks and give my staff the space they need to do what they do best.”
She makes design decisions based on her own experiences as a mother, like adding washer-dryer hookups in units even when it increases costs without adding points in competitive state funding applications.
“I know we can’t afford washer-dryer in units. That is not going to happen in our budget,” Smith explains. “However, I can afford to put the hookups in the unit. I’m not receiving any points from the state on our competitive application, there was no advantage to doing that. It’s just increasing construction costs.”
But Smith isn’t driven by spreadsheet logic alone. “I remember having a young baby who in the middle of the night, onesies are coming off, and walking to a laundry facility just isn’t really practical.
“I want someone to be able to drive into one of our communities and not know it’s affordable housing,” she says.
The former finance executives has undergone her own internal renovation when it comes to defining success. “When I first started, I thought success would be defined by my balance sheet,” she says. “What I’ve learned is that it’s more through impact… seeing a family who was struggling to find housing and we’ve been able to house them in one of our communities or drastically increasing the quality of life for a family through our rehabs.
The impact has exceeded her expectations. “When I first started, I don’t think I realized just how much this would change the lives for certain people or just how much me putting the work in or putting the focus on a particular community can change that community,” she says.
Smith has been called “an unusually involved owner who cares a lot” — a badge she wears proudly. Carson sometimes joins her at work sites, donning his construction hard hat and  helping clean his mom clean units with his mini-Swiffer.
As Carson Development continues to grow, Smith remains focused on investing in her team through compensation, education, and leadership. “Investing in your core team is, I think, the number one priority,” she says.
That impact has come full circle in Elkton, where a father and son (or mother and child) can now play on a brand-new playground — one built by a developer who saw not just dilapidated property, but a community worth investing in.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-30-at-10.02.10-AM.png,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

Hepper has resigned from Beneficient rather than subject himself to questioning about business transactions involving Beneficient. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The CEO of financial services firm Beneficient resigned rather than face questions by attorneys about accounting problems at the company, whose holdings include a Kansas bank charter that exempts dealings from regulatory oversight.
Brad Heppner’s departure from the Dallas-based company he founded reinforced concerns that Beneficient could collapse and break its commitment to provide financial support to the development of rural Kansas communities.
A Beneficient filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission included a copy of an email sent by a law firm representing Heppner that said he was stepping down June 19 as CEO and board chairman. The SEC document said Heppner refused an interview request from lawyers hired by Beneficient’s audit committee. The filing, posted Wednesday, also said Heppner declined to transfer control of preferred stock in Beneficient and to surrender shareholder voting rights to company stock.
Heppner’s resignation email said Beneficient managers pressured Heppner to resign by threatening to publicly disclose that he didn’t want to answer questions about his financial past.
In addition, the email said, Heppner was convinced it might be prudent to shut down Beneficient.
“Mr. Heppner believes that the only viable course for the company at this point is an orderly wind down of operations,” the email said.
Heppner was the face of Beneficient in the years since Kansas issued a banking charter to a Beneficient subsidiary. The charter allowed Beneficient to broaden the reach of a business in which it exchanged cash or stock for high-value illiquid assets, such as venture capital or private equity. Photos and video of Heppner now have been scrubbed from Beneficient’s website.
Heppner was a divisive figure in Kansas politics, with some lawmakers optimistic about the state reaping financial benefits from the company’s expansion and other legislators skeptical about the company and its executives.
“This is an embarrassment to the state of Kansas,” said Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat who opposed granting Beneficient special business status in Kansas. “The whole house of cards is rapidly falling down. I hope, at some point, there is an accounting from the members of the state Legislature who were asleep at the wheel.”

Big promises, questions
The Republican-controlled Legislature, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and residents of Heppner’s hometown of Hesston were convinced to invest political capital in the potential of Beneficient making a fortune from deals with big-time investors eager to swap their illiquid assets for stock or cash. The key incentive was that Beneficient would funnel a percentage of that fortune to rural communities like Hesston in the form of economic development grants.
Bipartisan legislation signed by the governor guaranteed Beneficient a coveted Kansas banking charter that exempted the company from standard state regulatory supervision, including fundamental “safety and soundness” principles. In Kansas, the Office of the State Bank Commissioner is responsible for issuing charters, or business licenses, enabling companies to make loans and provide other financial services. Kansas’ stamp of approval was important because Beneficient could present the charter as evidence of legitimacy to potential clients.
Heppner joined with Kansas political allies to successfully promote the idea they were on the verge of creating an asset-swap industry that would be the envy of other states.
In 2022, Heppner said the juggernaut would be so successful that 50 copycat companies would be operating in Kansas within two years. Other than Beneficient’s own subsidiary, no such companies exist.
Hesston Rep. Stephen Owens, a Republican who was at the forefront of Beneficient’s lobbying campaign to land a Kansas bank charter, said up to $1 billion would flow through Kansas within a decade via investors from California, Florida, Hong Kong, Russia and elsewhere. Owens, now a member of the Kansas Senate, speculated that Beneficient’s activities would cause millions of dollars to be earmarked for economic development in Kansas, with a sizable chunk directed to revitalizing Hesston.
Four years into this unprecedented public-private alliance, Beneficient’s prosperity gospel has been tarnished by fallout from the bankruptcy of Beneficient’s former parent company, lengthy federal investigations, a dizzying number of lawsuits, cratering of Beneficient’s stock price, layoffs involving dozens of employees, talk of Beneficient eventually descending into insolvency and, now, Heppner’s exit.
“I’m told they are on the verge of collapse,” said Cody Morton, a former Beneficient financial services professional among one-time employees who prevailed in Texas wage disputes against Beneficient. “I think Kansas is going to look stupid.”
Morton said he raised concerns about allegedly improper business practices with supervisors at Beneficient before resigning. He said he was among former Beneficient employees who spoke with the FBI about the company.
Kansas Rep. Rui Xu, a Democrat from Westwood, said he wasn’t concerned the state of Kansas would be financially liable if Beneficient’s business collapsed in Texas. Heppner and his backers in the Legislature said Beneficient’s collapse wouldn’t leave Kansas holding a damaged subsidiary. In fact, Heppner told lawmakers: “The regulator would not need to step in ever and oversee a failing institution.”
However, Xu said that wasn’t sufficient to quell his interest in what options would be available to the Kansas banking commissioner if Beneficient faltered.
“Do you have the ability to dissolve the charter?” Xu asked.
His question has no clear answer because Beneficient lobbyists successfully blocked inclusion in state law of an exit plan if calamity struck.
State banking commissioner David Herndon’s staff pressed lawmakers to create a plan of action in case Beneficient or its subsidiary, Beneficient Fiduciary Financial, faltered. He repeatedly warned the Legislature to strengthen regulatory oversight of Beneficient’s operations in Kansas.
“Exempting any regulated financial institution from the banking code in essence allows that financial institution to claim it is regulated but not actually be regulated,” Herndon said.
In frustration, Herndon recommended repeal of the state law authorizing Beneficient’s subsidiary to possess the bank charter.

Stock price collapse
Derek Fletcher, Beneficient’s chief fiduciary officer and president, said in an interview before Heppner’s resignation that it would be wrong to read too much into persistently negative publicity about Beneficient and its corporate leadership.
“I know a lot of folks in Kansas are concerned,” Fletcher said. “We’re optimistic about Beneficient.”
He said there was no threat to Beneficient’s economic development commitments to Kansans, specifically a promise to build a grocery store in Hesston.
“They’re not dependent on Beneficient continuing as an operating company,” Fletcher said.
Beneficient’s stock price, trading under the ticker BENF, topped $660 per share when the company was taken public less than two years ago. Its value on Nasdaq plunged to a new low of 26 cents per share June 24, but had hovered around 33 cents per share since March. At the close of Friday, BENF was trading at 29 cents per share.
Fletcher said Beneficient joined Nasdaq as a publicly traded company during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for GWG Holdings, which was Beneficient’s former parent company. The 2022 bankruptcy included allegations Heppner and others operated GWG as a Ponzi scheme and stripped GWG of cash to the betterment of Beneficient. GWG’s bankruptcy trustees have clawed back tens of millions of dollars from those responsible for the bankruptcy, which left GWG shareholders with potential losses of more than $1.5 billion.
In March, Beneficient settled with GWG’s plaintiffs for $50.5 million to be paid from a corporate insurance policy. That agreement didn’t require admission of wrongdoing. Plaintiffs who purchased GWG bonds could expect to receive $31 for every $1,000 invested in GWG — or 3 cents on the dollar — under this payment from Beneficient.
“We’ve had to dedicate a lot of time and resources to that matter,” Fletcher said. “Getting that behind us in a favorable way, which we believe this would do, allows us to completely focus 100% of our effort and our resources on growing and building the business.”
The Dallas Business Journal reported Beneficient’s stock performed the worst among 119 publicly traded companies in the Dallas-Fort Worth area during the first half of 2024. In April 2024, Beneficent responded with an 80-to-1 reverse stock split to convert every 80 shares to a single share. The transaction allowed Beneficient to avoid the ignominy of being delisted by Nasdaq.
In November, Heppner used a visit to Topeka to inform the Legislature that election of President Donald Trump could ignite interest in U.S. mergers and acquisitions and prompt a surge in demand for asset-swap deals capable of being handled by Beneficient.
“Beneficient is perfectly situated to provide the earlier liquidity from those alternative assets,” Heppner said.
Nasdaq notified Beneficient a month later the company would be held accountable for failing to comply with a requirement that its Class A common stock price hold at $1 or higher for at least 10 consecutive business days. Beneficient was given until mid-July to meet the price criterion or again face dismissal from Nasdaq.
Beneficient recently disclosed to the SEC that an ouster from Nasdaq and exclusion from a supplemental exchange could make it “extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares.”
 
‘Not a dollar’
Morton, the former Beneficient financial services professional, left the company after more than three years without thousands of dollars in bonus compensation that was owed to him.
Morton filed a claim with the Texas Workforce Commission that resulted in an order concluding Beneficient executives “acted in bad faith” and were obligated to make good on unpaid earnings to Morton. The commission declared Beneficient violated the Texas Labor Code and instructed the company to pay a $1,000 administrative penalty.
Morton, who obtained an $88,540 judgment against Beneficient, has yet to be paid despite months of legal proceedings. 
“If they choose not to pay these wage claims … then that is downright loathsome,” Morton said. “When I joined the Beneficient Company, I thought I was joining my dream job. I was wrong. The worst place I’ve ever worked. It was a fantasy land.”
Some of his former Beneficient colleagues faced similar situations.
“There’s a lot of frustration on our side,” said former Beneficient employee Nick Anderson, who hasn’t received any of the $73,000 he said the state workforce commission determined he was owed by Beneficient.
The experience of battling Beneficient management about bonuses promised in writing by a company executive was so ugly some former employees declined to be publicly identified as claimants.
“We, as a company, don’t believe these claims are valid obligations,” Fletcher, Beneficient’s president, said in an interview. “As a public company, we have a duty to our shareholders to really defend the company.”
Fletcher said he would put the number of Beneficient wage claims at one-half dozen.

‘Special place’
The image of a company dodging pledges made to their own personnel stood in contrast to the vision of wealth development articulated by Heppner and Fletcher, as well as state politicians and lobbyists, who pitched the bank charter idea four years ago. Beneficient gained political leverage by pouring tens of thousands of dollars into Kansas Republican and Democratic PACs in addition to individual contributions to politicians. That includes $15,000 to both the Democratic and Republican state parties. The Democratic governor’s reelection campaign got $30,000, while Derek Schmidt, the attorney general and GOP candidate for governor, took in $24,000.
Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce, testified to the Legislature that the business pitch by Beneficient produced this initial reaction: “Sounds amazing, but what is the catch?” Toland said the state agency vetted Beneficient’s proposed bill and concluded it was a “unique opportunity to assemble the first comprehensive statute that makes it possible for us to welcome” Beneficient and comparable alternative asset companies to Kansas.
Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican from Andover, used his influence at the Capitol to usher the legislation forward. He issued a letter that declared a series of lawsuits tied to Heppner or Beneficient were inconsequential to development of the company’s business model in Kansas.
A unanimous Kansas Senate and a bipartisan coalition of 103 Kansas House members bought into the idea of awarding Beneficient Fiduciary Financial a charter under a pilot project exempting it from some regulations applied to traditional banks and trusts. Kelly, the governor, signed that measure in 2021 and a subsequent bill making the charter permanent.
In 2022, Heppner confidently told lawmakers Beneficient was on the cusp of expanding its work with wealthy individuals or financial institutions eager to unlock the value of illiquid assets. The model would deliver prosperity from Heppner’s office on North Saint Paul Street in Dallas to Main Street in Hesston, he said.
“My hometown of Hesston holds a very special place in my heart,” Heppner said. “Years of underinvestment has seen our Main Street shutter key shops and businesses.”
Heppner predicted a proliferation of similar Kansas-chartered companies would follow in Beneficient’s footsteps. By law in Kansas, they would be known as a TEFFI, or Technology Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institution.
After nearly four years, Beneficient stands as Kansas’ lone TEFFI. State officials say they’re unaware of any other TEFFIs in the United States.
The promise Beneficient building an alternative asset empire, with Kansas as a hub in that world, has been tempered by harsh realities. In 2023, the company laid off about 45 employees. There was an SEC investigation of Beneficient, which began in 2021 and reportedly closed in 2024. Former employees of Beneficient said agents of the FBI interviewed them, but the status of that inquiry was unknown.
 
  Hesston native and Dallas businessman Brad Heppner promised to bring a grocery store, retail and chapel to his hometown’s main street, where he opened an office for his “technology-enabled fiduciary financial institution.” Kansas officials cleared the way for TEFFI operations in exchange for the promise of rural development. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
‘What’s going on?’
El Dorado Republican Sen. Michael Fagg said the value of seed money generated by Beneficient for economic growth shouldn’t be dismissed by critics. He said the company’s commitment to revitalizing Hesston was extraordinary.
“We wouldn’t have any of this,” he said. “We’re trying to promote a new idea.”
Whenever alternative assets were placed with Beneficient, state law says, 2.5% of financing for the deals had to be funneled to a Kansas economic development fund.
The statute also said the Department of Commerce would receive $250,000 of the $1 million in regulatory fees Beneficient annually paid to the State Banking Commission. The annual payment would be assessed June 30 with payment due July 15.
Beneficient’s TEFFI, so far, provided more than $3 million for economic development grants to 90 projects statewide. In January, the Department of Commerce allocated $22,500 grants to a dozen entities, including the Haskell Township Library. Grants for “community vibrancy” projects were made to Neodesha, Conway Springs and Burrton. Each required a 10% local match.
If Beneficient folded, however, the annual revenue for economic development projects would vaporize.
Beneficient has yet to deliver on the central trickle-down promise made to the 3,400 residents of Hesston — construction of a grocery store in town. A potential retail operator was identified and work to acquire property has been ongoing. Four years into the partnership with Beneficient, the company’s president wouldn’t commit to a deadline for the store’s opening.
“The challenge is that not all that is visible. It really presents questions of, ‘What’s going on?’ ” Fletcher said.
During the 2025 legislative session, Beneficient sought greater regulatory liberties, including an exemption on lending limits. House Bill 2235 stalled, suggesting shine may be wearing off the TEFFI experiment.
Democratic Rep. Virgil Weigel of Topeka said he questioned the viability of Beneficient’s strategy as far back as 2021, when he was one of 20 legislators to vote against the TEFFI Act. Controversy that followed Beneficient all the way into 2025 affirmed that assessment, he said.
“I was very skeptical with the whole thing,” Weigel said. “Quite frankly, I haven’t heard anything that has changed my mind.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heppner16x9crop-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Getty Images)Four unvaccinated Kentuckians have contracted the highly contagious measles, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) announced Friday. 
Three of the four cases were from the same household in Woodford County and the fourth, unrelated to the others, is in a Todd County person who was exposed while traveling internationally, the cabinet said. 
Kentucky has now reported six cases this year amid a decline in routine preventative vaccinations. None of the four had been vaccinated against measles, the cabinet said. 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect nine in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
“Measles is a serious disease,” Dr. Steven Stack, the public health commissioner and newly-appointed cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “Fortunately, people can avoid measles through safe and effective vaccinations. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.”

GUEST

Michelle Wu



THE JOB OF mayor often comes with bright lights, with the city as the stage. 
That’s confirmed by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s schedule – which in one day may include a coffee hour with constituents in South Boston, a GBH studio appearance in Back Bay and a Battle of Bunker Hill remembrance in Charlestown. Exposure like that is a big advantage for any elected official seeking another term, as she is attempting to fend off a challenge from nonprofit executive Josh Kraft. (CommonWealth Beacon has reached out to the Kraft campaign to invite him on The Codcast.) 
But Wu is also a self-described introvert. She didn’t get into the grip-and-grin tumult that defines city politics until after she arrived in the Boston area for college more than 20 years ago. She ran for City Council in 2013, and once in office, built towards a run for mayor. 
In that first campaign trail for her as a candidate, she ended up losing her voice by election day in 2013. “It was because in that year I probably had spoken more words than in all of the other years of my life combined, just campaigning and going around,” she said during a recently taped interview on The Codcast. 
“I definitely have had to really learn how to feel more comfortable doing public speaking, seem more comfortable doing public speaking, but a lot of it is practice,” she said. “And a lot of it is just feeling really excited about others, say, in the neighborhoods and in the people that I get to meet on a day-to-day basis.” 
Wu also discussed why she enrolled as a Democrat, and how she interprets recent polling showing that while New England voters are unhappy with the Trump administration, they’re even more upset with Democrats.  
“It’s not about a particular party or affiliation, but it’s things aren’t great right now, and there are reminders of that all around every single day … and we all need a reason to have hope,” she said. “We all need proof that forward momentum is still possible. And I think city government has a really key role to play in that, because this is still the level of government where you can get things done, where people can still come together across differences.” 
During the episode, Wu also talked about her first politically-tinged event (4:15), whether super PACs should exist (23:30), and her media diet (30:40).

(Photo provided by SC DMV)COLUMBIA — Sitting inside a South Carolina’s drivers’ licensing office to await your turn could become a thing of the past.
The budget that takes effect Tuesday allows the state Department of Motor Vehicles to begin raising the money it needs to upgrade software systems that are roughly three decades old.
DMV Director Kevin Shwedo said he doesn’t know of any state in the nation other than South Carolina still operating on a system developed in the ‘90s. But that’s about to change over the next five years as the DMV prepares for a nearly $100 million overhaul.
Leaders of SC courts, DMV warn what could happen if ‘ancient’ technology isn’t upgraded

Shwedo, who’s led the agency since 2011, warned legislators earlier this year that putting off upgrades could have dire consequences.
Wait times could soar again, he said, reminding legislators of the four-hour waits before the current computer system went live statewide in 2002. (Reducing the lines became part of then-GOP-nominee Mark Sanford’s winning campaign to oust Gov. Jim Hodges that year.)
And some of South Carolinians’ most sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, birth certificates, passport numbers, marriage licenses, and divorce papers, could be targeted by hackers.
The Legislature agreed, giving the DMV the OK to increase document fees by $4 and raise the necessary funding to build and maintain a new system expected to last two to three decades.
What’s next?
Shwedo points to South Carolina’s population growth over his tenure, from 4.6 million in 2010 to an estimated 5.5 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Yet the number of people working for the DMV statewide has changed little since it became a stand-alone agency in 2003, when Sanford signed the DMV Reform Act.
That leaves the agency turning to technology to make up the difference, transferring more services online to meet demands.
The DMV’s goal for wait times inside its branches is under 20 minutes. But actual waits vary. People are encouraged to check online for the number of people in queue and wait times at their local branch. At the Shop Road location in Columbia, for example, the maximum posted wait Monday morning was 25 minutes.
The upgrades should allow for most services to be done online, negating the need to come in at all, Shwedo said.
“We want to transition from ancient technology to one that will bring the DMV into your home,” Shwedo said. “I don’t want you to come to the DMV any more than you want to be there, which means I want to create more opportunities for you to interface with the DMV online. This technology will allow us to get there.”
Shwedo envisions a security system that verifies residents’ identity by tracking and identifying phone numbers when people come in or multi-factor identification when they sign in through the DMV website.
SC DMV announces new security features for licenses. They’ll arrive via mail.

He also hopes to install kiosks in county tax offices, so when people pay their property taxes they can print out their new registration on the spot.
Finally, the state is working on a virtual driver’s license and ID card, one that can be linked with other state licenses people may hold, such as a hunting and fishing license or a concealed carry permit.
A big expense
The problem is it’s a lengthy and expensive project.
DMV services are heavily intertwined with those of other agencies, such as taxes and probate court and insurance.
Shwedo said the agency will spend the next year contracting out the project. After that it will take two years to code driver-related information and then two more years after that for vehicle-related information.
To pay for it, the DMV is bumping up fees for things such as vehicle history records, accident reports and copies of traffic tickets from $6 to $10. It marks the first time in more than 40 years that these fees have increased. It also puts South Carolina more in line with fees charged in other Southern states.
The agency anticipates it will raise an extra $12 million annually.
It has $44 million available to get started. That includes $26 million the Legislature set aside for the project in the last two budgets: $6 million in one-time aid last year and $20 million in 2023. The DMV has additionally squirreled away about $18 million through fees.
After the upgrade is complete, the additional fees will cover the system’s annual maintenance costs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCDMV-Orleans-File-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Photo by Eric Pilgrim/U.S. Army)In a few days, the Howard County Council will have the opportunity to do something utterly sensible, at little or no cost to anyone: Discourage the use of a product that is demonstrably climate-changing, wildly unhealthy, increasingly expensive and occasionally blows up.
Too good to be true?  Not at all.
To achieve all that public good, all the council needs to do is amend the county building code to discourage new homes and buildings from burning methane (so-called “natural”) gas indoors. It shouldn’t even be a controversial idea.
But sadly it is. For nearly a century, the gas industry has bamboozled Americans into believing that burning this dangerous product is benign. Around 1940, a former employee of the American Gas Association gave the phrase “now you’re cooking with gas” to comedian Bob Hope, who then made it famous. In the 1970s, the AGA sponsored Julia Child’s TV cooking show featuring a gas stove and oven and made sure viewers knew it.
The often-seen phrases “natural gas” and “clean burning” are deceptive marketing tropes for a highly refined product whose burning causes immense damage to the climate.

Even as the scientific evidence of global climate disruption gets more frightening, big gas continues its decades-long campaign of confusion, much as the cigarette industry had done earlier. A chilling 1998 action plan from an American Petroleum Institute communications team makes the strategy clear: “Victory Will Be Achieved When … average citizens ‘understand’ (recognize) uncertainties in climate science.”
If you don’t care about the planet, focus on your family’s health. For decades, scientists have known that burning gas indoors causes respiratory harm, especially in kids.
The venerable American Lung Association recently told this to a federal agency: “Gas stove exposure can worsen asthma symptoms, wheezing, and result in reduced lung function in children and other vulnerable populations, particularly in the absence of ventilation and for children living with existing asthma or allergies. Additionally … research has established that exposure to pollutants emitted from a gas stove and other gas-powered appliances contributes to a variety of diseases including heart disease and stroke, asthma, COPD, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes, premature birth and respiratory infection.”
That’s just awful.
To top it off, burning methane gas in your home is increasingly expensive. A Maryland state agency has published an analysis showing that, within a few years, BGE customers’ monthly winter gas bills will grow to as much as FIVE TIMES what they are now, not because of the commodity price, but because BGE’s monopoly business model allows it to overhaul its ancient underground pipe system and bill gas customers for all its costs and profits.
Unsurprisingly, both the health harms and the skyrocketing gas bills fall hardest on the least well-off. Elected officials in Howard County and elsewhere strive to build affordable housing, but consigning residents of that housing to lifetimes of compromised health and unpayable utility bills is just a horrible idea.
Given the wide availability of efficient, cost-effective electric alternatives for heat, hot water and cooking, discouraging the use of this dreadful product in new homes and other buildings is a modest, reasonable policy step. Why wouldn’t any responsible government do it?
Public confusion, but also intimidating political and legal pushback.
Gas and building industry executives hire powerful lobbyists, and make corporate and PAC contributions, to preserve the status quo. Last year in Annapolis, more than 50 professional lobbyists were arrayed against the Better Buildings Act, which was similar to what the Howard County Council is considering now. Several industry groups, led by the National Association of Homebuilders, have sued both Montgomery County and Washington, D.C., for enacting bills to discourage methane in new buildings, part of a national legal strategy to prevent change.
Back in Howard County, dozens of concerned residents have attended recent council meetings to urge it to discourage gas in new homes and other buildings. Several have compellingly testified. A letter signed by 25 organizations, as well as a petition from 130 high school students, urged the council to act. Even so, it will take political courage for our small county council to slow down climate change, improve children’s health, lower many residents’ utility bills and promote social justice.
But Howard County has a thoughtful, progressive governing tradition, and there appear to be council members willing to resist the pressure. They can improve life for Howard County residents while showing Maryland and the nation how to promote the public good over special interests. If they do it, they deserve to be both celebrated and emulated by other state and local lawmakers.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5588392-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Photo from Alaska Department of Public Safety)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.



We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Find out what happened to three men who were arrested in California and deported. Also: Marines at the border, the political and economic toll of the immigration raids and why Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News. 

After the arrest: In the past few weeks, federal immigration enforcement agents have rounded up 1,600 people — most of whom have no criminal conviction — during raids in Los Angeles County. CalMatters spoke to three people who were detained during the first weekend of the raids and deported to Mexico. Their reports suggest that agents are working under a new playbook that enables them to make arrests using dubious pretexts, and encourages agents to push people to sign removal forms before speaking with an attorney. Mauricio Oropeza, who has no criminal record, was detained while waiting at a bus stop after work. He was then shackled in chains and driven to an ICE tent camp in Texas. There, he signed voluntary removal forms before finally being allowed to make his first call to his family. Learn more about what happened to Oropeza and other immigrants like him from CalMatters’ reporters. 


Marines on the border: Dozens of Marines have been stationed at a Border Patrol station located in eastern San Diego County. Previously, the armed forces were kept away from civilian law enforcement, so this move signals a change in both how the Marines operate and President Donald Trump’s border strategy. A spokesperson for Newsom’s office said the Marines’ presence represents “mission creep.” Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.


Population shrink: During Trump’s first term, California’s population declined in part due to his administration’s policies that made it harder for foreign workers to enter the country. Now the state is bracing for a similar hit with his return, as deportations and limits to U.S. entry threaten the state’s economy and Electoral College clout. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn. 


Newsom sues Fox: On Friday the governor filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the network of lying about the date Newsom last spoke with Trump on the phone, and for claiming the governor is lying about a call related to Trump’s deployment of federal troops in L.A.

CA braces for new fuel standard


Gas prices at a station in Victorville on May 19, 2025. Photo by Rene Ray De La Cruz, Daily Press via Reuters




The California Air Resources Board’s new rules for fuel standards take effect Tuesday. These rules aim to reduce air pollution but are controversial because they could also raise gas prices, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
The updated standard is expected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gasses by an amount equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year, according to the air board. Gas prices aren’t expected to rise immediately due to the new rules, and it’s unclear whether they will since it depends on how much the oil industry passes costs onto customers when it buys credits. 
But when the fuel standard was last updated in 2011, a gallon of gas rose by an additional 9 cents. This update could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon, according to a UC Davis researcher.
Republicans have slammed the fuel rules, arguing that they would make the state even less affordable. GOP state Senate leader Brian Jones of San Diego called the standard, “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom.”

Disabled workers to lose jobs after union dispute


PRIDE Industries employees rally in front of the Capitol Annex Swing Space in Sacramento on June 11, 2025. Photo by Cristian Gonzalez for CalMatters




From CalMatters local news fellow Joe Garcia:
Barring any last-minute legislative intervention, 58 disabled workers at a California state prison employed through nonprofit PRIDE Industries will lose their jobs on Tuesday because of administrative decisions that followed a union complaint about them.
SEIU Local 1000, the union that represents state custodians, alleged in a complaint to the State Personnel Board that the contract between PRIDE and the California Medical Facility prison at Vacaville violated guarantees that those job positions be filled by union employees.
After multiple short-term contract extensions, the PRIDE contract ends July 1. Disabled environmental service technicians will work their last shifts inside the prison, clock out and walk to their vehicles unemployed.
The state posted multiple job openings for custodians at the prison earlier this month.
PRIDE claims their lost job positions will ultimately be filled by incarcerated Prison Industry Authority workers — and not SEIU members as intended. Prison officials said they wouldn’t comment, and neither would the state human resources department.
Heather Dunn, who has worked at Vacaville for more than five years, doesn’t know what the future holds or where her next job might be. As a 38-year-old single mom, she worries for her 2-year-old son. “He still needs the things that he needs. It’s going to be really hard to provide for him,” she said.

Dunn: “Before I came to PRIDE, it was very hard for me to keep and to find a job due to my reading disability.”

Ameer Habeeb, a 52-year-old service-disabled Air Force veteran, works with Dunn and will lose his position as an environmental services director. 

Habeeb: “PRIDE’s given me the opportunity to be accommodated and given me opportunities where I’ve been able to grow.”

PRIDE workers continue to plead with state legislators and Newsom to step in and help them keep their jobs.
Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson of Suisun City has a bill in the works to create pathways for disabled workers to be brought into the union so they can be included in state contracts.

“At the end of the day, clean energy goals don’t really mean anything if you don’t have a solar industry to develop projects,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association. 
Supporters of the discarded measures to sunset Minnesota’s popular community solar gardens program and reduce utility payments to rural and small-town solar customers said they were needed to keep power affordable during the clean power transition.
“These provisions are birds of a feather that both attempt to reduce the cost ratepayers pay for clean energy,” said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato, chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities, Environment, and Climate Committee and chief Senate author of the 2023 clean power law. 
Frentz did not directly commit to bring up the measures again next session. But his committee “will do the same thing that I think all committees should do, looking at where we are as a state and deciding what we should prioritize,” he said. 
Earlier this year, Frentz’s committee voted 9-2 to advance a version of the 2025 energy omnibus with the net metering and community solar changes. A House version that did not include those provisions ultimately won out in special session negotiations.
Under current Minnesota law, community solar subscribers — including residential customers as well as businesses, nonprofits and government entities — pay solar garden operators a discounted rate for the power produced by their shares in the small arrays that dot fields and roofs around the state. They receive corresponding utility bill credits that can significantly reduce or offset the cost of electricity supplied by the utility.
The community solar program has grown dramatically since its 2014 launch, meaning Xcel Energy now pays subscribers hundreds of millions of dollars in credits annually. After years of legal wrangling, state regulators last year reduced the value of those credits in a move they said would save Xcel Energy up to $41 million per year. The ruling also expanded community solar eligibility to Minnesota customers outside Xcel territory.
Without the proposed changes, the average residential Xcel customer would have paid $7 per month in 2024 to support community solar subscribers, the Star Tribune reported. In 2023, Xcel estimated that community solar represented 20.5% of its electric fuel costs while providing about 3.8% of its electricity in Minnesota.
Frentz said this “cost shift” unfairly burdens regular utility ratepayers to benefit community solar subscribers, who make up a small minority of all Minnesota customers. A similar dynamic plays out between customers with onsite solar arrays, which receive “net metering” payments from local utilities that are generally much higher than the price utilities pay for power, he said.
“It’s around twice the cost that is then passed onto (customers) who did not agree to it and for the most part did not know about it,” Frentz said. 
Solar proponents say that’s not the full picture.
The cost shift is a “myth,” said Bobby King, Minnesota executive director for Solar United Neighbors, pointing to a 2024 Minnesota Department of Commerce study that said community solar would deliver nearly $3 billion in net benefits over 30 years.
In any case, last year’s Minnesota Public Utility Commission ruling and state legislation passed in 2023 went a long way toward addressing calls to reform the program, O’Grady said. 
The legislation, in particular, represented a hard-fought compromise between the solar industry and Minnesota utilities, ratepayer advocates and other groups, he said. It shifted responsibility for the program from Xcel to the Minnesota Department of Commerce; set declining annual caps on new statewide community solar capacity; significantly increased the maximum size of individual installations; and established carveouts for low- and moderate-income subscribers.
“The changes the Senate wanted to see already happened,” O’Grady said. “We didn’t love them all, but we agreed to them because we heard the message that they were needed.”
Further changes to community solar and net metering would constrain customer choice for customers who want alternatives to their local utility, he added. Reducing net metering payments lengthens the payback period for people who install solar on their properties, making those investments less appealing. 
Frentz argued this session’s debate was about leveling the playing field for all clean electricity sources in all parts of the state, rather than continuing to put a thumb on the scale for smaller-scale solar installations that today mostly serve Xcel customers. The promise of fairness and flexibility helped quell rural electric cooperatives’ and municipal utilities’ opposition to the 2023 carbon-free power law, he said.
Right now, the lowest-cost path to a carbon-free grid involves lots of large-scale wind, solar and battery power. But that could change as technological breakthroughs drive down the cost of other forms of power, like geothermal, Frentz said.
“Flexibility is the selling point,” he said.
Another threat: Republicans in Washington
Whether that flexible clean energy future comes to pass in time for Minnesota’s 2040 deadline depends to some extent on what happens in Washington, D.C. this summer. 
On May 22, the Republican-controlled House passed a sweeping budget that would rapidly phase out federal tax credits for wind, solar, geothermal and other carbon-free power sources. President Donald Trump urged the Senate “as soon as possible” to ratify the bill, which independent analyses say could dramatically reduce new clean energy deployments and add $33 billion to consumers’ annual energy bills by 2035.
Days later, Trump took executive action to force at least two aging, expensive coal- and oil-fired power plants to remain open past their scheduled retirement date, citing the “national energy emergency” he declared in the opening hours of his second term. 
If enacted, the Republican budget “would eviscerate our industry…we could see 75% of our members go out of business or get acquired by others,” O’Grady said. “To me, this is an anti-jobs bill.”
O’Grady’s focus right now is “putting names to faces” for GOP legislators whose votes could be decisive. A meeting between staff from top-ranking House Republican Rep. Tom Emmer and a dozen MnSEIA members representing about 2,000 jobs was cause for cautious optimism, and MnSEIA is encouraging members who do business in other GOP-leaning areas to engage with local representatives, O’Grady said.
No matter how the federal fight turns out, Minnesota’s solar industry is gearing up for another state policy bout in 2026.
“We fully anticipate this issue will be brought up next year and we will fight it,” O’Grady said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Long-Lake-CSG-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

No immediate hike in California gas prices will occur but Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature fear the effects of the clean-fuel program.


California’s revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard takes effect on Tuesday, despite fierce Republican criticism and increasing Democratic trepidation over its potential to raise gas prices.
The new rules — which expand a program to reduce climate-warming gases and clean the air  — ratchet up requirements for cleaner fuels and broaden a $2 billion credit market aimed at cutting emissions from cars, trucks and freight.
No immediate hike in gas prices will occur. Experts say the future impact is uncertain because it depends on how much the oil industry spends on buying credits and then passes it onto consumers.
The previous fuel standard, which was set in 2011, added 9 cents to the cost of a gallon; a UC Davis researcher estimates that the new one could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon.
The Newsom administration is bracing for more political attacks as Republican legislators have seized on the issue. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office issued a fact-check memo defending the rule and saying the impacts are exaggerated, while Republicans in the Legislature and Congress say it would damage the economy because Californians already pay the most in the nation for gasoline. State Sen. Brian Jones requested an audit of the rule, calling it “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom, hitting Californians where it hurts the most.”
Democratic lawmakers last week introduced legislation that would cap the price of the standard’s fuel credits in an effort to rein in price spikes at the pump. The measure is supported by one of the state’s most powerful Democrats, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, who said it “will reduce costs for drivers across the Golden State while continuing to move our climate and energy goals full steam ahead.”
The new fuel standard is projected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gases by 558 million metric tons through 2046, according to the air board’s economic assessment. Those reductions are equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year.  Some critics say that is an overestimate, because soybean fuels may not be as clean as reported.
Cleaner, low-carbon fuels include biofuels made from soybeans or cow manure. The program has been particularly successful in reducing the diesel fuels used by medium and heavy-duty trucks. Over the 13 years, it has displaced 25 billion gallons of petroleum fuels, according to the air board.
The new fuel standard was temporarily delayed earlier this year when the state’s administrative law office rejected it and sent it back to the air board to add more clarity to the rule. 
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat, last month called for the resignation of California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph over concerns that the agency did not study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Randolph said in a statement that gas prices are “over a dollar per gallon cheaper than just a few years ago. Our efforts to deploy more zero-emission vehicles and reduce fossil fuel use is working to cut demand and create more competition in the fuels market, and the (fuel standard) is a big part of that effort.” 
In an unrelated action, California’s gasoline excise tax, which is adjusted annually, will increase by 1.6 cents per gallon on Tuesday. The tax is primarily used to pay for roads and highways.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052925-Gas-Prices-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.
His office this month negotiated seven agreements with unions that pause state spending for two years toward one of California’s largest long-term debts: the health care benefits civil servants receive in retirement. 
Newsom’s pause on the pre-funding payments for current workers has the potential to free up a lot of money. His office in May estimated those payments would cost the state more than $700 million in the new budget year.
But the promise to workers is massive: At the last official estimate, California would need $85 billion to pay for the retirement health care benefits it has promised to state employees. 
The governor’s move to suspend payments toward future retiree health care coincides with another big concession he’s asking from unions as he manages a $12 billion deficit. The new contracts include furloughs that trim take-home pay for public employees over the next two years and essentially negate the raises state workers are getting this year.
But six of the proposed labor agreements have a sweetener to ease the pain of the furloughs. 
Like the state, workers represented by those unions won’t have to pay anything toward their retirement health care for the next two years. Suspending that deduction puts between 1.7% and 4.5% of their earnings back into their paychecks. 
“For my members, the cost of living in the state is so high, it just gives them a little bit of relief in putting money in their pockets that wouldn’t be there otherwise,” said Ted Toppin, the executive director of the union that represents state engineers, Professional Engineers in California Government.
Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents about 100,000 California civil servants, announced Sunday that it also made a new labor agreement with the Newsom administration that gives workers a break on the retirement health care deduction for two years. Neither the union nor the state have said yet whether the agreement pauses what the state was supposed to pay for that benefit.
“This will boost take home pay,” the union said in its message to members.
Newsom’s predecessor, former Gov. Jerry Brown, created the plan to pre-fund retiree health care benefits by having both the state and employees chip in money every paycheck. He insisted on it in difficult labor negotiations that resulted in unions agreeing to what was then a new paycheck deduction.
Until then, California had paid for the retiree health care exclusively through the state general fund. Brown and others were concerned that the pay-as-you-go practice would eat up larger and larger slices of state spending because of the rising costs of health care.
This year, California expects to spend $3 billion on the health benefits its already-retired civil servants will use, up from $1.6 billion in the 2016-17 budget year.
The state calls that other post-employment benefits, or OBEB, meaning benefits in addition to pensions.
Over time, the contracts Brown negotiated would gradually create a trust fund for retiree health care and remove that expense from the pot of money the state uses for general government services. On the current timeline, that would happen some time in the late 2040s.
Toppin, who was involved in the Brown-era contract negotiations, said the state has flexibility to manage its goal for retiree health benefits.
“This is a long horizon,” he said. “At least for the state in this year and the near term the need is deficit reduction, and for my members the need is they gotta pay the bills.”
But it also comes with long-term risk and likely will delay the state’s plan to stop paying for retiree health care out of the general fund, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
“Suspending the state’s contribution to prefund (retiree health care) reduces costs today but contributes to a significant and growing unfunded liability and creates risk that the benefit will not be fully funded” by the state’s target date, legislative analyst Nick Schroeder wrote in an assessment of Newsom contract with the union that represents correctional officers.
The state expects to save about $100 million a year from the prison guard contract alone by suspending its payments toward correctional officers’ retirement health care.
Newsom previously allowed state workers to skip their paycheck deduction for retiree health care early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when his office negotiated labor agreements that included furloughs because of fears that the virus would trigger a painful recession. The state restored the money in the 2021-22 budget.
“The state remains committed to pre-funding retiree health,” said Camille Travis, the spokesperson for the state human resources department, in a written statement. “The suspension of contributions to the retiree health trust will help address the budget shortfall in the near term.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

(Photo courtesy of Tim Peterson, flown by Lighthawk)The U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture recently announced it would try to roll back the “roadless rule,” a decades-old policy that prevents road construction and logging on nearly 4 million acres of national forest in Utah. 
Brooke Rollins, the department’s secretary, called the rule “overly restrictive” and an “absurd obstacle” to forest management when she made the announcement during a Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico. The rule, she said, prohibits agencies from properly managing forests and preventing wildfire, while stifling the timber industry. 
Utah leaders celebrated the decision, with House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, calling it a “big win” for the state. 
But in Utah, proponents of the rule say it’s a vital tool for protecting the state’s forests, which in turn keep water clean, provide habitat for wildlife and allow recreation opportunities. 
“This rule protects almost half of the forest service land in Utah,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications director for the Center for Western Priorities. “This opens about half of Utah’s forest land to logging that has been previously protected. That can drastically change the feel of some of our most popular forests.” 
The scope of the roadless rule in Utah 
The roadless rule was established during the Clinton administration in 2001 and restricts road construction and reconstruction, and timber harvests, on roughly 58.5 million acres of the country’s national forests and grasslands. The goal, according to the forest service, “is to provide lasting protection” on some of the country’s most remote areas.  
Called inventoried roadless areas, the forest service created boundaries around roads and existing infrastructure to identify stretches of forest eligible for more stringent protection. Inventoried roadless areas are typically sorted into two categories — places where road construction or reconstruction is allowed, and places where it isn’t allowed. 
There are roadless areas along the Wasatch Front, in places like Big, Little, Millcreek and American Fork canyons; in vast sections of the Uinta Mountains; in southern Utah, near Moab and Monticello. They can be recreation hotspots, with some of the state’s most popular hiking trails on or near roadless areas.

Utah has roughly 8.1 million acres of national forest, according to the federal government, spread out across eight regions — Ashley, Caribou, Dixie, Fishlake, Manti-La Sal, Sawtooth, Uinta and Wasatch-Cache national forests. 
According to forest service data, about 4 million acres is inventoried roadless area — road construction and reconstruction is allowed on about 3.5 million acres, and prohibited on the remaining 446,000 acres. 
But according to Tim Peterson, the cultural landscapes director for Grand Canyon Trust, the distinction can be misleading. 
“We haven’t built a lot of new roads in our national forests over the last two to three decades,” said Peterson, who’s been involved in Utah’s roadless areas since the 1990s and helped conduct inventories for environmental groups. “Road building is so expensive and the forest service already has a maintenance backlog … we can’t even maintain the roads that we have, let alone build new roads.” 
Regardless of whether new road construction is or isn’t allowed, the rule generally prohibits timber harvesting in covered areas. There are exceptions, Peterson said, including mechanical thinning, removing trees killed by insects, or for fighting fire. 
In an email, Redge Johnson, the director of the Utah Public Land Policy Coordinating Office, acknowledged the exceptions, but said the state is still confined in its ability to manage forests to improve habitat and reduce fire danger.
“While the roadless rule allows for limited timber harvest it has so many restrictions it makes it nearly impossible for timber projects to be completed,” Johnson said. “Our forests are overgrown and unhealthy, it is past time that we start to actively manage our national forests.” 
Johnson shared a picture with Utah News Dispatch that he took while on a recent horsepacking trip through the Manti-La Sal National Forest, that shows an entire ridge with mostly dead coniferous trees. 
“Even though there are old logging roads on the ridge shown, we can not use them to remove the dead timber due to the restrictions from the roadless rule. Removing this dead timber would reduce wildfire risk, increase wildlife habitat and protect our watersheds,” Johnson said.

What’s next? 
Despite Rollins’ announcement, the federal government still needs to go through a formal process to rescind the roadless rule. 
That includes preparation of an environmental analysis, making sure the action complies with the Endangered Species Act, and consulting with local governments and tribes, according to the forest service. 
Johnson called Rollins’ announcement a first step. 
“Our office is awaiting more information on what the process will entail,” he said. 
Peterson noted that the Trump administration isn’t the first to try and rescind the rule. 
“It’s much more complicated than just saying you’re going to get rid of it,” he said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2005, the Bush administration tried to replace the it with the State Petitions Rule, which allowed governors to tailor their own national forest protections. Some states submitted plans that aligned with the original protections — others, like Idaho, asked for drastically reduced protections. 
The Bush administration’s rule was challenged in court and ultimately overturned.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert also tried to petition the government for a Utah-specific roadless rule in 2019, which was ultimately unsuccessful. 
What to expect if the roadless rule is rescinded 
Assuming the administration is able to scale back the rule, there would be 4 million extra acres of forest service land in Utah that would be open for timber harvesting — the state says that would allow for increased wildfire mitigation and forest management. 
“We are excited with this new direction by the United States Department of Agriculture,  allowing the federal government, state partners and industry to address a variety of forest health and ecosystem services issues, like water quality/quantity, wildlife, forage and air quality,” said Johnson. “We are looking forward to engaging with the Trump Administration, USDA, and the Forest Service to promote healthy, diverse and productive forests here in Utah and across the country.” 
Rollins, in a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, said to date about 8 million acres of roadless forest around the country have burned in wildfire, and rescinding the rule would free up forest managers who she argues are constrained by the rule. 
The USDA also said rescinding the rule will help boost the state’s economy. 
“Utah alone estimates the roadless rule alone creates a 25% decrease in economic development in the forestry sector,” reads a press release from the department. 
Advocates for the rule, however, are skeptical. According to an analysis from the forest service, the roadless rule has led to an estimated reduction of just 59 jobs related to timber harvesting in Utah and Peterson said the logging industry in the state was never that robust to begin with.  
“There has never really been a huge timber industry in Utah,” he said, “and getting rid of the roadless area rule would not make for a big timber industry in Utah, because roads are so expensive to build.” 
If the forest service is serious about expanding timber harvesting, he said, it’s going to need a bigger budget. The agency’s deferred maintenance backlog for roads and bridges was estimated at $4.4 billion in 2022 and the president’s budget proposal would slash millions from forest service operations. 
“If we’re going to be building roads and doing timber sales, it’s not reflected in the budget that the administration has put forward to Congress,” Peterson said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Powell-Point-in-Table-Cliffs-Henderson-Canyon-IRA-Dixie-NF-c-Tim-Peterson-Lighthawk-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

“We are currently awaiting the required list of nominations from the speaker, pro tem and lieutenant governor for this appointment,” a spokesperson from the Governor’s Office said.
Gwathney declined comment on Tuesday. She will continue serving as a member of the parole board until the governor’s office submits another candidate to replace her.

The former prosecutor’s six-year term overseeing the board has been controversial. Parole grants plummeted into the single digits during her term, though they have grown in recent years. Critics have laid much of the blame for declining parole rates at Gwathney’s feet. The board’s delays in updating parole guidelines drew sharp criticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who made the board’s funding for 2026 contingent on the board drafting them.
“I don’t think there is a word that adequately describes how badly the last six years have been in terms of what the law was, what the goals were, and how, I am pretty sure, under her leadership, the parole board missed almost every one of those goals,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of both Gwathney and the current parole process.
“If there is a checklist out there for what is necessary to lose your job, I believe Leigh Gwathney hit every one of them,” he added.
New laws, declining numbers
Gwathney assumed office in 2019 after the Legislature approved an overhaul of the board. The move came after Jimmy O’Neal Spencer, was mistakenly released from prison in 2017. The following year, he murdered three people in Guntersville, including a seven-year-old child, during a series of robberies. A jury convicted Spencer of capital murder and sentenced him to death in 2022.
The 2019 law created a director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles and provided stricter rules for granting applicants parole, especially if they committed a violent crime. The legislation also established guidelines that would recommend if applicants should be granted parole or be denied.
The law required the parole board to update the guidelines every three years based on data to grant parole to applicants who are the least likely to be a threat to public safety.

The parole rate has declined dramatically since Gwathney was appointed to lead the parole board. According to data obtained from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the parole rate was 55% for 2017 before steadily declining for the next several years.
It was 53% in 2018, one year after Spencer murdered three individuals after earning release. It declined again in 2019 to 31%, to 20% in 2020, 15% in 2021, 10% in 2022 before reaching its lowest point to 8% in 2023. For 2025, the rate increased to 26%.
Matthew Mangino, a former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania who served for six years on the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, said in an interview that parole helps people transition from prison back into their community.
“It helps those individuals with re-entry skills, whether it is dealing with their criminal conduct in the past, finding a skill, or continuing rehabilitation or treatment,” he said. “And it is also an opportunity to monitor these people while they are on the streets to ensure they are not violating the technical aspects of their release or involved in other criminal activity.”
Criminal justice reform advocates said Alabama’s parole board made decisions that did not comply with established guidelines.
According to a September 2024 monthly statistical report, the guidelines recommended that 83% of applicants be granted parole for that fiscal year but the grant rate was 20%. That results in a conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows its own guidelines, of 25% for that fiscal year.
For 2023, the guidelines recommended that 81% of applicants be granted parole while the board only granted parole in 10% of the cases, a conformance rate of 12%.
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, said the “unfortunate result” of the decline in paroles was that “more people are leaving prison at the end of their sentences with little or no parole supervision, which generally does not correlate with increased public safety.”
“The supervision and programming that comes from someone being granted parole generally means more services and more accountability for people leaving Alabama’s prisons,” she said. “A strong parole program with reasonable grant rates can contribute to public safety. Thousands of people exiting prisons, often after decades of living in violent, chaotic surroundings, with no supervision or programming generally does not.”

Some lawmakers also expressed concerns regarding the parole board’s decisions and the impact it has on the criminal justice system writ large, but especially on the violence and overcrowding within Alabama’s prisons.
“I am a second-chance person,” said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro. “I believe that people deserve a second chance. And, at the end of the day, these people are going to get out at some point, whether they are going to EOS out, end of sentence, or they are going to die there. They are going to be released at some point in time. And so, I think when you continue to just deny people, deny people, when they have done everything that you have asked of them to do, it sends a bad message.”

Frustrations over guidelines

Some lawmakers have been increasingly frustrated with Gwathney and the parole board. Their frustrations culminated at a Joint Prison Oversight Committee meeting in October, when Gwathney gave what legislators considered evasive answers to direct questions.
Singleton said during an interview last week that he understood the difficulties of the job but that Gwathney and the parole board had not met his expectations.
“In the past, we have tried to get information, and we have not gotten the information,” Singleton said on Wednesday. “And when we have gotten information, it was misleading information.”
England was even more critical, accusing Gwathney of violating the law after the board went two years without updating parole guidelinesThe parole board in May proposed guidelines that will be submitted to public review, but England expressed doubts about their quality.
“It has been six years now, and what we have essentially done is waste time, a lot of money, and resources,” England said in an interview Wednesday. “Which includes changing guidelines and score sheets, depending on who was in front of her, so all that data is corrupted.”
Pennsylvania relied on guidelines to make parole decisions, Mangino said.
“We had the same numerical score that came from this guidelines process that would say whether someone was likely successful on parole or not,” he said. “You look at the crime, whether the defendant has taken responsibility for that criminal responsibility, you look at the actuarial tools as an aid to tell you what sort of risk, what sort of level of treatment someone might need, what medical health issues they have to deal with on the street.”
He also said that the state’s department of corrections would issue a recommendation for the parole board to consider.
“If you were going to go against the guidelines, you had to provide a written reason why you deviated from the guidelines,” Mangino said.
England has proposed legislation aimed at reforming the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles that would incorporate some of the factors Mangino used to guide his decisions.
The proposals included a validated risk assessment to guide parole decisions and to weigh whether a parole applicant is eligible for work release according to the Alabama Department of Corrections as factors for deciding parole. England also proposed legislation that requires members of the parole board to justify their decisions when they deviate from parole guidelines and allow applicants who have been denied parole to appeal their decisions to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.
Thus far, the bills have failed to pass the Legislature.

‘I don’t want to weigh in on that’

State senators who would approve the candidate for the board, whether Gwathney or someone else, declined to comment on her potential candidacy.
“I don’t want to weigh in on that,” said Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, last week.

The order put some universities on their heels, with Michigan State University abruptly canceling a Lunar New Year celebration due to the executive orders, later rescheduling the event following backlash from students. 
In the months since, the administration has issued a “Dear Colleague” letter providing educational institutions from pre-schools to universities with a Feb. 28 deadline to dispense with their diversity programs at risk of losing federal funding, arguing that these programs are discriminatory. 
Many colleges ignored the president’s demands, with the President of Western Michigan University instructing the campus to “please proceed as usual” according to a report from the Associated Press. 
In service of this decree, the United States Department of Education launched investigations into several universities across the country over race-based programming, opening investigations into Grand Valley State University and the University of Michigan on March 14. 
Less than two weeks later, the University of Michigan announced it would shutter its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, while halting its DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan.

Some public universities pull back on Juneteenth festivities
Juneteenth, celebrated annually on June 19, commemorates the date in 1865 when union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas and announced more than 250,000 enslaved Black people were free by executive decree. While the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect more than two and half years prior, the order was not implemented in several places under Confederate control.
Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since 2021, and was celebrated in Michigan as an official state holiday for the first time in 2024. Although many state universities held panel discussions, showed documentaries, held workshops and spotlighted Black-owned businesses, there was a noticeable pull back among some universities this year, who either downsized from previous celebrations, or opted against celebrations entirely. 
While Northern Michigan University led festivities for the first time, and scheduled celebrations at Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University and Grand Valley State University looked similar to – or built upon – prior events, the University of Michigan’s celebration was notably smaller this year. 
In years past, the University’s Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives held a multi-day “Juneteenth Symposium” which included panel discussions, artistic performances and a Juneteenth Block Party in 2024. This year’s event was instead hosted by the University of Michigan Detroit Center, and featured two speakers focused on community resilience and local advocacy.

Brendan Kirwin, a spokesperson for the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives, confirmed that they would not be hosting the symposium in 2025. When asked why the office had opted against hosting the event this year, Kirwin said the office was making some changes to its focus, and other offices the university is stepping into for the time being to assist.  
Juneteenth celebrations at Western Michigan University have looked different year to year, with the Black Graduate Student Association co-hosting events in 2021 leading up to, on and following the holiday. In 2022, the association hosted a Juneteenth Gala, while the university’s Merze Tate College hosted a Juneteenth cookout in 2023 and 2024. 
However in 2025, no events were listed on the university calendar. In a June 17 email, Paula Davis, Western Michigan’s associate vice president for strategic communications, said she did not know if the university was hosting any events. In a follow up email on June 20, Davis said as far as she knew, no events had been held or were planned. 
Michigan Technological University leadership in April discussed a number of policy changes brought on by the executive orders, including phasing out the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and moving its staff to new roles at the Center for Student Support and Mentorship. According to the Daily Mining Gazette, Vice President of Student Affairs Laura Bulleit assured panel attendees that Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth celebrations will still take place as long as they remain federal holidays.
While the university held events commemorating Juneteenth in 2023 and 2024, none were listed on the university’s event calendar for this year. University communications did not respond to multiple emails asking whether the university had any celebrations planned.

Part of a national trend
Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education said their members had seen a “troubling” trend of institutions scaling back or entirely eliminating academic or social support programs, including celebratory events. 
As far as why universities are scaling back, Granberry Russell referenced the demonization of the DEI acronym by conservatives and pointed to comments Trump made on Juneteenth where he declared in a post to his social media site that the nation has “too many non-working holidays.”
“Why choose Juneteenth, you know? And we’ll see if, if there’s something akin to that, if the Fourth of July falls on what is otherwise a working day,” Granberry Russell said. “I doubt very seriously that there will be criticism leveled against the Fourth of July as Independence Day.”
As part of the dilemma for universities concerning Trump’s executive orders, Granberry Russell noted the orders refer to programs such as “illegal DEI” and “radical and wasteful DEI” without offering any definition. 
The association, with the American Association of University Professors and other groups, is challenging those orders in court, arguing they unlawfully restrict speech, exceed presidential authority, and obstruct Congress’ constitutional power over government funding.
“The executive orders that we have challenged, for example, by President Trump, are intentionally vague and misleading, and I think as a result you’re leaving institutions in a state of ambiguity,” Granberry Russell said.
The executive orders, as well as prior anti-diversity initiative laws implemented in various states and others that have been introduced, are making it difficult for universities to determine what is permissible and what may trigger a lawsuit, Granberry Russell said.
While federal holidays serve as an opportunity to celebrate and commemorate events such as the end of slavery in the United States, that designation can also be seen as permission for universities to mark an event without a threat of that event being categorized as an illegal or wasteful DEI effort, Granberry Russell said.

However, celebrations can be held as a token gesture rather than an authentic acknowledgement, which is sometimes the case with federal holidays, Granberry Russell said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion programming and policies, alongside university celebrations, are a way of honoring the lived experiences and contributions different identity groups or communities have made to our democracy, Granberry Russell noted.
However, the pushback against these policies has isolated certain lived experiences based on gender, race or sexuality, deeming them wasteful or radical, Granberry Russell said.
She noted that it required the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the country to begin to move toward fairness and equal opportunity, Title IX to acknowledge that gender should not be a barrier to opportunities and pointed to the Americans With Disabilities Act as another law aiming to remove barriers and protect disabled individuals.
“These laws and celebrations and acknowledgements are intended to say, more broadly, you belong here. You are welcome here. We’re going to remove barriers and obstacles to your lived experiences. You should have the right to excel on your merit. That’s what this is all about,” Granberry Russell said.
While things may have started with opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the outrage has extended far beyond those programs, calling the value of higher education into question, Granberry Russell said.
Eliminating programming that honors communities whose contributions were often left out of history is not a neutral step, and can be interpreted as forgetting about the contributions and sacrifices these communities have made, Granberry Russell said.
“We do have to ask ourselves, in higher education, what kind of learning community we cultivate when we choose silence over celebration?… This is not progress and it is not honoring the history and the lived experiences of those who have contributed to this country,” Granberry Russell said.

In NAACP v. Alabama, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the state could not compel the NAACP to release its membership lists. 
The lawsuit arose out of a lawsuit filed by Alabama Attorney General John M. Patterson, who claimed the civil rights organization had harmed the state’s reputation by promoting the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the admission of Autherine Lucy to the University of Alabama. 
Justices wrote that requiring the NAACP to turn over membership lists would violate the First Amendment, which promises the freedom of association. 
“It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action,” the justices wrote. In the past, such exposures had led to members suffering “economic reprisals, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion and other manifestations of public hostility,” the justices wrote. 
The ruling proved a great victory for the civil rights organization, which enabled it to continue operating in Alabama.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06130723/Rosa-Parks.jpg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

I do not have access to military intelligence. Or any expert knowledge of the Middle East.
But I’ve spent my adult life watching American presidents try to bomb the region into peace. It never works.
Which leaves me wondering how Alabama’s senators, who on paper have better sources than us Goat Hill wretches, think that President Donald Trump’s decision to attack Iranian nuclear facilities solved anything.
“President Trump is going to win the Nobel Peace Prize, no doubt,” U.S. Sen. Katie Britt said on Fox News last week. “He has brought peace to a region that needed stability.”
The bombs were still falling as Britt spoke.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“President Trump blew the hell out of them,” said Britt’s colleague, U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, on another Fox News network that same day. “And it’s obvious that that worked.”
That’s not at all obvious, actually. But it’s not international affairs that concern me here.
These are two of the most powerful people in the nation, with a responsibility to our state and an unparalleled opportunity to improve the lives of nearly 5.2 million Alabamians.
And what are they doing with that power?
Debasing themselves in public worship of a man with a bottomless sense of victimhood and a thoroughly selfish view of the world and those in it.
Of course, it’s no secret that Britt, Tuberville and almost every Alabama Republican gush over Trump and attack his enemies with the fervor of a Justin Bieber fan on Twitter in 2009. The median Republican position is that the president is infallible in word and deed.
That belief means embracing Trump’s fantasies. And prioritizing them over the needs of Alabama.
It’s not just Tuberville praising a military deployment against largely peaceful protestors holding “non-American flags.” Or Britt cheering as Trump attacks the federal department that feeds a lot of children in poverty in Alabama.
Just look at this congressional budget bill, looming over us like an avalanche.
They call it the “big beautiful bill” because Republicans never contest Trump’s perceptions of reality. Big, certainly, but not beautiful. The legislation contains provisions that are likely to do major damage to health care in the state and make it harder for hundreds of thousands of Alabamians to get food.
Tuberville has expressed some mild concern over cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the bill, less for the effect it could have on 752,000 Alabamians who depend on it for food than the costs Trump has proposed shifting to state government, which Tuberville would like to lead in about two years. Britt on Sunday said that would encourage states to put “skin in the game.” I don’t think a Legislature that refused federal aid to expand Medicaid can be trusted to do what Washington won’t.
But neither Tuberville nor Britt appear overly concerned over the bill’s broader rollback of health care provisions. The legislation proposes cutting over $820 million in state funding for Medicaid, which covers about 20% of Alabama’s population, most of them children, the elderly or those with disabilities.
That will curtail health care access, particularly in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling to survive and health care providers are few and far between. Nor does the bill extend enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of the year that give 170,000 Alabamians access to Affordable Care Act plans. All of this will mean less preventive care; sicker people; more emergency room visits, and greater strain on state hospitals.
The administration is also cutting billions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health, money that supports institutions like the University of Alabama Birmingham, the state’s largest employer. Britt has signaled some unease about that, but the most she’s done is get HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — not someone whose word can be trusted — to mildly praise the work done at UAB. The administration shows no signs of backing off the cuts.
Neither Britt nor Tuberville seem interested in confronting Trump over any of this. Their priority is keeping the president happy. Tuberville even adopts Trump’s dehumanizing rhetoric about immigrants.
But the president is never happy. His re-election campaign ran on conspiracy and fear-mongering. Trump sees invisible cabals out to get him at every corner. He posts angry screeds at the slightest criticism. And he surrounds himself with flatterers who only speak in superlatives.
Our senators have joined this fawning choir. At our expense.
They’ve made Trump’s priorities — the ceaseless aggrandizement of Donald Trump — their own. Our senators have little to show for their time in office than an affirmation of the president’s paranoia and delusions.
So we get U.S. senators calling a man who unleashed bombs a peacemaker. Who shrug as he plans a major assault on Alabama’s well-being.
But no praise chorus can reverse the reality of the suffering the bill will unleash. Or erase the memory of who was responsible.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Katie-Britt-Tommy-Tuberville-composite-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, and SB 166, sponsored by Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, would have required public K-12 schools to display an 11-by-14-inch poster of the Ten Commandments in common areas and classrooms where American history is taught.
The House passed its version of the bill 81-11 on April 22, but it never received a final vote from the Senate. Kelley said in an interview Wednesday that he and Gidley will bring the legislation back next year as is.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I wished we could have gotten it through the legislature this past session,” Kelley said. “I think we had reached a point where we would have accomplished that.”
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays.
The Louisiana Legislature passed a law in 2024 which, unlike the bills in the Alabama Legislature, required the document to be displayed in all classrooms. A federal court ruled last week that the law is unconstitutional, and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, prohibiting the government from establishing a state religion or favoring one religion over another.
Despite the difference in the Alabama law, senior counsel Keisha Russell with the First Liberty Institute, a law firm that specializes in “defending religious freedom,” said that if the bill passes next year, it will still be challenged in court and likely deemed unconstitutional. She said in an interview Wednesday that whatever happens to a potential Alabama law will depend on what happens with the Louisiana law.
“I think it’s going to rise or fall based on what happens in this particular case with Louisiana, because the bills are pretty similar no matter what,” she said.
Kelley said he is not worried about an Alabama law being challenged in court, mostly because his legislation does not mandate the display in every classroom and because the intent is the historical context of the biblical text.
“I think ours is sticking with historical content, and so I think we’ll be fine with what we put together and the changes that we’ve made,” Kelley said.
A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director of the Alabama American Civil Liberties Union, said the ACLU has been opposed to the legislation from the beginning. She said that because the Ten Commandments is derived from religious text, it is inherently religious, not historical.
“I think that’s a really interesting argument to make, to allege that a document that has text that’s found in the Bible, in some folks’ Bible, is supposedly not religious,” Robinson said in an interview Thursday. 
Russell said that requiring the text to be displayed where history is taught would require the text to be in every elementary school classroom and some middle and high school classrooms.
“It’s still going to be virtually everywhere, right? Common areas, lunchrooms, all of that,” Russell said. “I think there’s a better argument to say you’re going to put it in all the classrooms than to say that you’re just going to stick it in like the locker room or the lunchroom, which is a common area. To me, that has less sort of academic value than if it’s in the classroom.”
Robinson said the location of a poster does not make its presence any more constitutional.
“There is still a captive audience there,” she said. “They have to go to school, they have to be in classrooms, and they still are going to have to look and see that poster every day if this bill were to be signed into law.”
Opponents of the legislation argued during public hearings that the version of the Ten Commandments in the bill combines multiple versions of the text and is not historical.
“This bill is a violation of the First Amendment and imposes a certain religious understanding of a certain text that has been hodged-podged together and linguistically abused and has no place in our public schools,” Rev. Julie Conrady, a minister with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham, said in March.
 Kelley said Wednesday that the intent of the bill was manipulated to be religious, and that his intent is solely historical and based on the founding of American law and the Constitution.
“It’s just the manipulation of what the intention is, of what the words are by others is where the conflict comes in,” he said. “Anybody that has learned history from an early age, they learned how it’s influenced us.”
Robinson said that the first amendment was inspired by the founders’ belief that religion should be separate from government.
“If we want to talk about historical importance, then I think it’s important to go back to the founders’ original intent,” she said. “There’s so many different versions of the Ten Commandments depending on what particular faith or translation you subscribe to. So by only posting one version of the Ten Commandments in classrooms, then really you could say that politicians have crafted their own version of the Ten Commandments, and they’re trying to impose it on public school students throughout Alabama.”

Wes Moore is ambextrous must come in handy. Here he is signing with his left hand in his first bill signing in 2023. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Of the 300 bills with July 1 effective dates that were signed into law this year, most attention — and aggravation — will be focused on just one, the Budget Reconciliation and Finance Act of 2025, a 200-page bill that raises $2 billion in fiscal 2026 through a combination of new taxes and spending cuts.
And most attention in the bill that goes by its shorthand, BRFA, will be focused on a new a 3% tax increase on the sale of many informational technology services, which alone is expected to raise more than $480 million in new revenue that will help the state close a $3 billion budget hole it found itself in at the start of the year.
The bill also includes new, higher income tax rates for the highest earners and allows local government to increase the amount of income tax they collect. It also includes taxes on cannabis sales, mobile sports wagering and vehicle emissions inspections, among many others.
But the bulk of the new laws are not about dollars and cents. Also starting Tuesday are changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s decade-long education reform plan; an expansion of solar-power siting options; a sweeping Chesapeake Bay cleanup bill; and a program to allow state funds to be used for abortions for uninsured and underinsured state residents.
The taxman cometh
For the first time, technology companies will have to pay a sales tax on their services. The tax, originally proposed as a 2.5% business-t0-business tax, was expanded to a 3% on all sales, money that supporters say is needed to head off funding cuts to critical programs in the state.
But critics say the tax — expected to raise $483 million in its first year, growing to $747 million by fiscal 2030 – is a job killer that will drive businesses out of the state. In floor debate on the House floor this spring, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), the vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, took the remarkable step of announcing that he was relocating his tech business outside the state because of the tax.
The tax will apply to a range of services: cloud storage, data entry, data processing, media streaming data storage and technical support, telephone-based recorded information services, cryptocurrency mining, news and press clipping services, media archives such as for film and music, computer software design services, and dozens more.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

Affiliated companies would not have to pay the tax among themselves, and the law exempts emerging technology companies located in the “Discovery District” in College Park. It also exempts companies such as IonQ and companies that do business with a developer of quantum computing technology, an industry that Gov. Wes Moore (D) has targeted for development as part of his efforts to diversify the state’s economy.
The tech tax is the biggest single in the BRFA, but it’s far from the only one. The new law also:

Creates two new upper-end tax brackets and increases the tax on them from 5.75% to 6.5%, while increasing the standard deduction from $2,500 to $3,350 ($6,700 for joint filers and some others), which is expected to bring in $344 million;
Allow local governments to raise their income tax from the current maximum of 3.2% of reported state income tax — the rate currently assessed by 18 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions — to 3.3%;
Raises the tax on mobile sports wagering from 15% to 20%;
Expedites the phase-in of higher vehicle excise taxes;
Increases the cannabis sales tax from 9% to 12%;
And raises the vehicle emissions inspection fee cap from $14 to $30.

The bill also allows the imposition of a $5 fee on the sale of new tires, to help support the Transportation Trust Fund, but that tax will not be assessed until Jan. 1, 2026.
New funding for abortion grants
A new law allows the Maryland Department of Health to release millions of dollars in unspent insurance funds that it hopes to use to fund abortions for uninsured and underinsured Marylanders.
Senate Bill 848 and House Bill 930 create the Public Health Abortion Grant Program, which will be used to help cover abortion costs for uninsured or underinsured Marylanders. The grant program will use $25 million that have been collected in premium surcharges that are required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not been spent down.
That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy, to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million a year, as collections have outpaced need.
Under this law, providers will receive the grant funds for providing abortion services for people who do not have insurance or whose health insurance does not cover abortions. While the law goes into effect July, the fund to create the grant program will not be established until September.
Solar bill powers up
Beginning Tuesday, local governments will have less say in the siting of large-scale solar fields, under a law that changes how Maryland regulates solar energy sites.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The law undoes restrictive zoning laws passed in several counties and sets uniform environmental standards for solar farm construction, including rules requiring buffers of trees and shrubs, and limiting the disturbance of topsoil.
The Renewable Energy Certainty Act was part of a three-bill energy package sponsored by Democratic leadership, who said it aimed to prevent solar developers from getting caught in a confusing tangle of local regulations, and stimulate the growth of desirable renewable energy.
It passed over Republicans’ protests, particularly that the bill would leave valuable agricultural lands vulnerable to solar development. The bill does set a 5% limit on solar development in pre-existing agricultural “priority preservation areas,” but opponents argue that that percentage still has the potential to disrupt fragile local farming economies.
An effort by opponents, largely farmers, to challenge the bill by referendum fell just short of the petition signature requirement.
With the bill taking effect, many local jurisdictions are scrambling to update their regulations about solar, said Dominic Butchko, the director of intergovernmental relations at the Maryland Association of Counties, in a recent interview, checking to make sure their local laws mesh with the state’s new policy and aren’t any more restrictive.
The quick turnaround time for counties to fix their laws before the state solar bill takes effect might create some “bumps” in the road, Butchko said, but he said any loose ends are likely to be tied up in the months ahead.
“The counties can go less extreme than what was outlined in the legislation. They just can’t go more extreme, and so jurisdictions are going to have to go through the bill and just make sure that whatever they have on the books really aligns with that,” Butchko said.
The Blueprint
Three years into the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the 10-year schools education reform plan gets some tweaks in the the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, which takes effect Tuesday.
One major part of the Blueprint deals with the implementation of “collaborative time,” which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.
But state school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, they would need to hire at least 12,000 new teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.
The law taking effect Tuesday pauses the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keeps the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.
Local school officials and advocates have expressed repeated frustration in implementing the Blueprint plan. In December, the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland released a report that included a recommendation to clarify roles between state Board of Education and Accountability and Implementation Board, which oversees the Blueprint. That recommendation bore fruit last week, when the two boards approved an agreement that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each.
But some Republican lawmakers and education advocates already say they are going to continue to push for more Blueprint reforms when the General Assembly returns in January.
¡Si, ellos pueden!
Thousands more Marylanders are expected to be able to take the General Educational Development test, also known as the GED, for the equivalent of a high school diploma, now that the test will be offered in Spanish as well as English.
Senate Bill 451 sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and House Bill 325 sponsored by Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery) will allow individuals to take the exam at least twice a year at locations throughout the state. Wims said earlier this year Maryland was the only state to publish the test in English only.
In written testimony on the measures, the department said slightly more than 9,000 people whose primary language was Spanish enrolled in programs it offered in 2023-24. Of those individuals, approximately 4,177, or 46%, did not have a high school diploma.
The new law comes as President Donald Trump (R) has issued an executive order making English the official language of the U.S. and rescincing a 2000 executive order signed by then-President Bill Clinton (D) that directed federal agencies and organizations receiving federal funding to improve access to services for those are with limited English proficiency.
The U.S. has never had an official language, and it’s unclear what effect Trump’s order can have, absent legislation. According to a June 3 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, about 22% of people in the U.S. age 5 and older spoke a language other than English between 2017 to 2021.
The law also requires the state Department of Labor, which administers the GED tests, to study whether the test can be offered in other languages besides English and Spanish. Those recommendations must be submitted to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees by Dec. 1, 2026.
FBI funding
Speaking of pushing back against Trump, House Bill 1078 sponsored by Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Nicole Williams, Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez directs the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”
The proposed new FBI site in Greenbelt was chosen in November 2023 by the General Services Administration as the next home for the FBI headquarters and its 7,500 employees.
But on the same day the House approved the measure in March, Trump said he would stop plans to build the new FBI headquarters in Maryland, noting that it’s a blue state and claiming that the Greenbelt site is “three hours away” from the agency’s current site at 935 Pennsylvania Ave. NW in Washington. The Greenbelt site is about actually 16 miles from the D.C. location.
The GSA had two other finalists for the FBI site, one in Landover, also in Prince George’s County, and another in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives claim the process to select Maryland was flawed, especially after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process — but not with the Greenbelt site.
FBI Director Kash Patel said last month about 1,500 employees would be transferred to other locations nationwide, but did not mention a site for a new headquarters.
Young adult health care subsidies extended
Young people buying health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace will continue to see savings on their monthly premiums, thanks to the new law that eliminates the expiration date for the State-Based Young Adult Health Insurance Subsidies Pilot Program.
The current program aims to help low-income Marylanders between the ages of 18 and 37 afford individual health plans through state-funded subsidies, taking an average of $40 off of their monthly insurance premiums. Those savings range depending on the individual’s financial situation.
Officials say that the subsidies have led to an increase in enrollment from this age group, which helps create a healthier insurance pool all around and lower rates for everyone. With the new law under House Bill 297 and Senate Bill 5, those savings will be permanent, so long as the state has funding to support the subsidies.
Establishing a disability employment initiative
One of the governor’s priority bills, to help give people with disabilities greater access to employment opportunities, will launch in July.
House Bill 502 establishes the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy. The new office will explore strategies to improve employment, training and care-readiness of people with disabilities.
The office will also implement the “Maryland as a Model Employer Initiative” which will help connect people with disabilities to jobs and promote career advancement for those individuals. The office will also report data on the success of those effort to the governor and the General Assembly starting next December and every year after.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0368-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Joe Lombardo made righting Nevada’s economy a focus of his gubernatorial campaign. Now, as he begins his quest for re-election in 2026, critics contend he has failed to fulfill two central promises – to make housing more affordable and to lower the unemployment rate.
Lombardo’s policies on housing and employment often appear at odds with his goals, say observers.
“He has no intention of lowering rents or increasing availability of affordable housing, and that became apparent,” says Shelbie Swartz, executive director of Battle Born Progress, pointing to Lombardo’s enlistment of a Republican lawmaker to kill a measure that would have capped corporate investment in residential housing.
On the employment front, sacked with the highest jobless rate of any state for the last year, Lombardo pursued an anti-worker agenda, critics contend, including a veto of legislation that would have required paid family and medical leave for employees of some private companies.
The governor did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this story. 
 ‘Trickle-down housing’

Of a handful of bills championed by Lombardo this year, only two passed – an education reform measure and a housing act aimed at reducing demand across the spectrum by creating a new level of subsidized housing for buyers earning up to 150% of area median income (AMI).
Subsidized housing is currently reserved for individuals earning up to 80% of AMI, and in some cases up to 120%.
“It’s kind of like a trickle-down housing policy,” says Ben Iness of the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “Are middle-income folks those that need support the most? Are they in dire straits compared to our low income and extremely low income residents?”
The idea behind the policy is that more market-priced, ‘attainable’ homes will free up existing units for low and extremely-low income Nevadans, who have fewer choices than low-income Americans in any other state. 
“The trickle-down theory doesn’t work,” says Las Vegan Frank Hawkins, who has built thousands of low-income and affordable units in Nevada. “It’s like saying I’m gonna give you nothing and I’m gonna give you more of it, and sooner or later, you’re gonna have something.”
Yet, Hawkins, a former Las Vegas city councilman, is excited the law facilitates construction of properties for sale, rather than for rent, and is hopeful Lombardo’s plan will spur gentrification in distressed areas such as the Historic Westside, where dozens of vacant parcels are owned by the government, even if it’s unlikely developers will pursue the opportunities. 
“Builders want to be out in the suburbs,” he said. “And they want everything to be on new streets, for new people.” 
In Clark County, where the area median income for a household of four is estimated at $75,000, a buyer earning $112,000 would be eligible for Lombardo’s plan. The threshold would be slightly higher in Washoe County, where the AMI is $83,800. 
At that income level, a prospective buyer could qualify for a home valued at roughly $460,000.
The median price of a single family home in Clark County sold in May was $480,000, up from $425,000 when Lombardo took office in January 2023. The median price of a home sold in Reno was $595,000, up from $510,000 when Lombardo took office. Rent at both ends of the state is also up from when Lombardo became governor.  
The housing act was initially slated to cost $250 million and serve 16,000 households, but was scaled back to $133 million with a goal of creating 5,000 single-family homes.
Lombardo has access to other incentives that don’t require public funding, such as inclusionary zoning, a policy that requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new residential developments or pay into a fund that does the same. 
As a candidate, Lombardo, a free-market enthusiast, rejected proposals such as rent stabilization and inclusionary zoning. Instead, he said he’d “provide incentives and defer payments on land” to generate more affordable housing.
Supporters of Lombardo’s legislation reject the notion that it ignores the need in low- and extremely-low income markets. Nevada has 14 units for every 100 extremely-low income residents, the lowest level in the nation. Other programs, they note, such as federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), are doing the work to develop units at the low end of the market.  
“Nevada’s housing crunch is not limited to affordable units. It is a system-wide shortfall,” says Wally Swenson of Nevada HAND, which facilitates low-income housing development. “Families at every income level are competing for too few homes, which results in rising home prices, forcing more competition for both naturally occurring and purpose-built affordable housing.”
Middle-income buyers, Swenson says, are “edging out neighbors with lower incomes.”
While housing reserved for low-income residents is essential, building at every price point, he says, “is a sustainable strategy to address the downward pressure on affordable housing and support our growing communities.”
Ennis of the NHJA questions whether federal funding for low-income housing will fall victim to President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting. “It’s hard to suggest our state is immune from what’s happening nationally.”
The LIHTC program is not currently in jeopardy, In fact, both parties have voiced support for expansion of the credits.
While housing construction lagged growth in the decade from 2010 to 2019, a surplus of units built before the Great Recession has picked up the slack, say a chorus of experts who contend the housing shortage is manufactured.  
“Unfortunately, not enough of it is affordable, especially for low-income and very low-income families and individuals,” says Kirk McClure, a Kansas University professor who co-wrote a study published in the journal Housing Policy Debate.
Affordability challenges, he says, are a result of low incomes versus high housing prices, rather than a shortage.
“This condition suggests that we cannot build our way to housing affordability,” he says. “We need to address price levels and income levels to help low-income households afford the housing that already exists, rather than increasing the supply in the hope that prices will subside.”
Iness of NHJA agrees. Absent solutions for low wages, tenant protections, measures to keep rents in check, enforced habitability standards, and controls on corporate purchases of residential units, Lombardo’s policy, he says, seems superficial. 
 Giving away the house

Builders, who learned they can make higher profits by selling fewer homes, are not building much, and when they do, it’s not the multifamily units that are desperately needed, especially in Southern Nevada. In 2023, Reno and Sparks issued 15% more multi-family building permits than Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas combined, reports the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities.
Thanks to inflation, the high cost of capital, and the cost of materials, “a lot of projects just don’t pencil in anymore,” says Nicholas Irwin, research director at UNLV’s Lied Institute. “On those lower-income projects, the capital financing is just not there, or the cost of construction is just so high. Given a choice with a piece of land, developers know if they can get more of an upper-end of market distribution, that’s their target.”
Whether Lombardo’s effort frees up units that can be filled by low-income earners remains to be seen, says Irwin. “Whenever you expand eligibility, those programs are going to help get more people into housing. We don’t know if it’s going to be the people at the very low or upper distribution of that spread.”
Subsidies for affordable housing are designed to solve the resulting math problem when development doesn’t add up. Gap financing, low-income housing tax credits and other subsidies guarantee the project and its resulting below-market rents won’t be a drain on developers.
Until recently, such programs have been reserved for critical efforts to provide units for low and extremely low-income residents, who are often seniors and others on fixed incomes.
“What we’re seeing now is the markets underproviding middle-income housing as well,” says Irwin. “We need to build more housing of all types.” 
Irwin notes other states are using public money to incentivize developers. Colorado lawmakers are shoveling public money into housing projects targeting households earning as much $170,000 a year, the Colorado Sun reports. 
Legislative insiders suggest that politics, not policy, is the impetus for Lombardo’s housing gamble, which enhances the governor’s bona fides with voters, apart from any ties that may bind him to Trump.
He is expected to face off against Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat.
Six of eight Republican state senators voted against Lombardo’s housing bill, which had widespread support from Democratic lawmakers and passed unanimously in the Assembly.
 ‘An unusual twist’

On the campaign trail in 2022, Lombardo blamed then-Gov. Steve Sisolak for the state’s unemployment rate, and suggested it was under the governor’s control. 
Under Lombardo, the state has led all others with the highest unemployment rate in the nation for the last year, and the job growth rate is the fourth lowest in the nation. 
In his 2025 State of the State address, the governor noted that under his watch, a record 1.6 million Nevadans are on the job. “But in an unusual twist, Nevada’s unemployment rate stands at 5.7 percent – a number that reminds us there is still much work to be done.”
Lombardo acknowledges that, for the most part, his initiatives are intended to appeal to employers, not to the workers he seeks to enlist.
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment,” Lombardo said in his veto message of a bill that would have required businesses with more than 50 employees to provide 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Current law requires 8 weeks of PFML leave, but only for state employees.
In two legislative sessions and in public appearances, Lombardo has eschewed worker-friendly policies, such as prevailing wage, a provision initially exempted from his housing bill, and he’s laid the blame for the state’s jobless rate on its residents.
‘We’re number one in job availability, but we’re number one in unemployment, you know why? Because they’re not quality jobs,” he said at a Republican gathering this year. “People would rather manipulate the government process and receive unemployment or to sit at home versus occupying a job that’s available that doesn’t see their family moving forward.”
Lombardo’s economic development bill contained a rare pro-worker initiative that would have provided transferable tax credits to help finance a new or expanding child care facility for up to five years. It went nowhere in Carson City.
His efforts to diversify the economy have “brought $5 billion in economic development into the state,” he told a Republican gathering in April. His Office of Economic Development notes 41 companies have made $6.7 billion in capital investment during his term. More than half of the investment – $3.6 billion – is from Tesla, Inc., which had a footprint in the state before Lombardo took office.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NZ65871-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

But what does that phrase mean?","On May 30, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states it designated as “sanctuary” jurisdictions. The state of Connecticut itself, plus six of its towns, were on the now-deleted list.
Some local representatives were surprised to see their municipalities on the list. Others were not.
The term “sanctuary city” is controversial because it has no official legal definition, but it generally refers to jurisdictions limiting their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.  
Here’s what you need to know about sanctuary cities and Connecticut officials’ reaction to the DHS designation.
What are sanctuary cities?
According to Global Refuge, a nonprofit that helps people settle in the U.S., sanctuary cities have policies that set boundaries on what information or support local or state governments provide to federal immigration authorities. 
The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, classifies a sanctuary jurisdiction as “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
Sanctuary cities are often in areas with large immigrant populations, according to the national organization Vera Institute of Justice.
According to the American Immigration Council, some so-called “sanctuary policies” can include actions like: limiting the ability of local or state police to “arrest or detain people for federal civil immigration violations;” prohibiting cooperation agreements like 287(g), which allow ICE to deputize local officers; preventing local staff from asking about immigration status or restricting what information can be shared with federal agencies.
What Connecticut towns were on the list?
The towns of East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden were included in DHS’s list. The state of Connecticut itself was also named a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The Department of Homeland Security did not provide an explanation as to why these towns in Connecticut were specifically cited or what the criteria were for being added to the list. It also did not provide an explanation as to why the list was taken down.
Of the municipalities on the list, only Hartford and Windham have enacted resolutions calling themselves sanctuary cities, while New Haven and Hamden have designated themselves as “Welcoming Cities” instead. 
In a statement, the Town of East Haven said that they were inaccurately named on the list. “Let us be clear: the Town of East Haven was never informed of this designation by any federal agency, nor do we agree with it,” the statement said.
“The classification issued by the Department of Homeland Security was not only absurd — it is baseless,” East Haven Mayor Joseph A. Carfora said. “Before the page was removed, my administration followed up with DHS to demand clarification and to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office. We will not allow East Haven to be mischaracterized without accountability.”
But New Haven and Windham officials also said they never received notification of their inclusion on the list. “Windham has a large Latino population and it’s well known the present [federal] administration targets poor communities as we have limited resources,” Mayor Thomas DeVivo said. 
New London Mayor Michael Passero said he does not know the definition of a sanctuary city.
“I can only tell you that New London has never declared itself a sanctuary city,” he said.
What are the town’s policies on immigration enforcement?
Not every town calls itself a sanctuary city, but they all have policies that deal with immigration in some way.
In New Haven, Mayor Justin Elicker signed a Welcoming City executive order in 2020, affirming “the city’s commitment to ensuring residents feel safe accessing public services.” 
The directive bars city employees from inquiring about or revealing a person’s immigration status unless mandated by state or federal law. Elicker said in a press conference last month that New Haven does not obstruct justice. He said the city’s welcoming policies make the community safer by encouraging people to report crimes, seek health care, and send their children to school without fear.
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it,” he said in a press conference, referring to New Haven’s inclusion on the sanctuary city list. “New Haven is proudly a welcoming city… Our immigrant community is part of our New Haven family.”
East Haven’s policy is that since immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, the East Haven Police Department generally does not participate in ICE operations except “when formally requested as part of an on-going criminal investigation, or from notifying those federal officials in serious situations where a threat to public safety or national security is perceived.” 
The Hartford Code of Ordinances does officially declare Hartford a “sanctuary city.” The local laws state that all residents of Hartford, regardless of their immigration status, have equal access to city services and referrals to medical or social agencies. This policy does not restrict city employees from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when legally required.  
Hamden’s policies limit local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Officers can’t ask about immigration status unless it’s tied to a criminal investigation, and cannot question victims or witnesses about their status. They also may not arrest or detain individuals based only on civil detainers or administrative warrants, except as required by state law. Town resources, including police and school staff, cannot be used to assist ICE unless mandated by state statute or a federal judge’s order.
New London has shared on its town website the Family Preparedness Plan, Preparing Your Family for Immigration Enforcement. This is a statewide document that has information for families concerned about immigration enforcement, not specific to New London. 
The New London Police Department prohibits officers from asking about immigration status unless it directly relates to a criminal investigation, according to a local executive order. Officers are also not allowed to detain or question individuals only based on suspected immigration violations, but the policy states local police may assist federal authorities if requested.
Windham became a sanctuary city following a 2017 resolution that passed unanimously. The resolution reaffirmed its commitment to protecting all residents, including undocumented immigrants who contribute to the community. It also states that no town official or “personnel” shall arrest, detain or report a person based only on immigration or citizenship status except due to a valid criminal warrant, or to comply with a civil immigration detainer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

WOLF LAKE. Ill. — Standing on the edge of a 300-foot limestone bluff in southern Illinois’ Shawnee National Forest, Machaela Sweeney could thank the perfect words she typed into ChatGPT for bringing her to the unexpected spot.

“I literally looked up lush, magical, fairytale areas,” she recalled, looking over the edge of the forest’s Inspiration Point Trail.

A 30-year-old social worker from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Sweeney was looking for a destination to recover from burnout. The AI app recommended two destinations: North Carolina or southern Illinois.

The first recommendation didn’t surprise her. Sweeney said that many people in Kentucky go to the Great Smoky Mountains when they want to get away. But she had never heard anyone talk about the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois before.

“So this almost feels like a hidden gem,” Sweeney said. “If somebody was going to the Smokies all the time and they were tired of it, I would say, ‘Try mixing it up.’”

The forest stretches across the eastern and western parts of southern Illinois, from Inspiration Point Trail overlooking the Mississippi River Valley here in the west to the popular Garden of the Gods wilderness area in Herod to the east.

Sweeney is among the growing number of visitors discovering southern Illinois as a travel destination amid a recent effort to entice more people to visit for the summer season.

Carol Hoffman, executive director of the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau, said the primary draws to southern Illinois are the outdoor recreation activities in Shawnee National Forest, including hiking, cycling, rock climbing and ziplining, as well as another Illinois surprise linked to the unusual terrain: vineyards and five wine trails.

The bureau has appealed to riders of the Chicago Transit Authority with a recent signage campaign that invited potential travelers to “go where the bus won’t take you” and to “come see our skyscrapers.”

In addition to plastering photos of lush greenery and rocky bluffs across Chicago buses and train stops, the bureau has paid to have promotional mailers, exhibits, shows and content creator posts that promote tourism to Illinois’ southern region.

Southern tourism bureaus have been tapping into a trend of high visitor spending in Illinois in recent years, exceeding pre-pandemic numbers for the first time in 2023, according to the most recent available data from a 2024 report prepared for the Illinois Office of Tourism.

More than $80 billion in economic impact

In 2023, tourists spent over $47 billion across Illinois, creating nearly 450,000 new jobs and generating over $6.5 billion in state and local taxes, according to the 2024 Tourism Office report. The report estimated that tourism in that year generated over $80 billion in total economic impact for the state.

Travel tourism influencer Jessica Baine, 35, has worked on tourism promotions with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and Jackson County’s Southern Illinois Tourism bureau for more than two years.

Baine, a Carterville nurse practitioner raised in southern Illinois, said she regularly receives messages from viewers online who were surprised by the content she shared, telling her, “I had no idea that southern Illinois looked like that.”

Hoffman’s group aims to connect with people within “an easy day’s drive,” typically those within a three- to six-hour driving distance from the forest, such as those living in central and southern Illinois and in the St. Louis metro area.

The advertising campaign is just one in a series of projects seeking to boost tourism in the area in recent years. The industry has seen a more than twofold increase in funding since 2023, with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or DCEO, giving out over $9 million in grants to boost tourism in the southern part of the state.

That money was distributed to cities and tourism bureaus across the southern half of the state for the last fiscal year, from Alton and Mattoon down to Metropolis, the officially designated home of Superman, where fans can take photos with a 15-foot statue of the comic book hero.

Past Illinois tourism campaigns have paid major returns. In the 2023 fiscal year, every dollar invested in promoting tourism generated $75 in direct visitor spending, according to the 2023 – 2024 Economic Impact of Tourism report by the DCEO Office of Tourism.





Grant funds are matched by local hotels and motels hoping to bring travelers in, according to Hoffman.

In some cases, lodging is the attraction itself. According to Lyle and Tammy Woodrum, the married innkeepers of the Davie School Inn in Anna, Illinois, a fifth of their guests come just for the experience of staying in a former schoolhouse.

Originally built in 1853 as a school, the Davie School Inn was repurposed as a bed and breakfast, but still looks in many ways like a school, with various rooms featuring desks, globes and chalkboards covered with messages from past guests.

Susan Hill traveled from her home in Memphis to stay at the Davie School Inn last month. She said she’s done it a handful of times since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was looking for somewhere to stay where she could sit outside.

According to Hill, the novelty of staying in an old school was a draw. “It’s like, heck yeah, come on,” she said. “It's just really quaint. I feel safe there.”

The Woodrums said most of their guests have come for the area’s local attractions, primarily the Shawnee Hills Wine trail and outdoor activities in the Shawnee National Forest but also for family and college reunions.

‘Wine just likes us’

Shawnee Hills Wine Trail is the largest of the state’s five trails, comprising 12 wineries and 13 locations. It originated in the summer of 1995, when owners of the first three wineries in southern Illinois — Alto Vineyards, Pomona Winery and Owl Creek Vineyard — worked with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and the Carbondale Convention and Tourism Bureau to start the first wine trail in Illinois.

Maggie Pugh, assistant manager at Feather Hills Vineyard on Highway 51, said the campaign to attract tourists to the region has had a real effect on the winery. Recently, the company ran out of three of its bestselling — and most bottled — wines, which, to her, is an indicator of increased visitor flow.

“I think we are getting busier. I think the advertising has worked,” she said. “I also know that the Wine Trail is doing quite a lot to try and bring more people down, because part of the problem is, this area isn't taken seriously for wine — although it should be.”

Illinois is the second-flattest state on the nation’s mainland, seemingly perfect only for corn. But Pugh described the Shawnee Hills region — home to many of Illinois’ highest elevations — as a “little golden nugget” in which “wine (is) just likes us, grapes enjoy our soil.”

Since 2015, wineries on the trail have won over 30 medals in national and international wine competitions. Although the vineyards are geographically close together, scattered across an area of 40 miles, the trail boasts a wide range of wines, Pugh said.

“The coolest part about southern Illinois is that even a winery that’s only 20 minutes away from this location right here, our wine is going to taste vastly different, even if we made it the exact same way,” she said. “Our grapes don’t taste the same because of the elevation, and you get those slight hints that might make or break a wine for you.”

‘Illinois’ most hippie town’

Award-winning wines and breathtaking vistas aren’t the only unexpected finds in southern Illinois.

Makanda, a short drive from the Southern Illinois University campus in Carbondale, features a boardwalk of shops by local artists. Artists sell jewelry, gemstones, sage for burning, paintings, intricate metalwork and more. The tiny village of fewer than 550 people, a short drive from SIU, proudly calls itself “Illinois’s most hippie” town.

Nina Kovar is one of those artists. In her Visions Art Gallery, dream catchers are hung along the front window, inviting shoppers to come browse clothing, jewelry and handmade ceramics.

Kovar said she sees graduates coming back for homecoming again and again, as well as others who are discovering the town for the first time after hearing about its hippie reputation.

“There’s a certain timeless element to it,” Kovar said of Makanda. “The creativity that we have, that a lot of us are artists and artisans and crafters, that it's kind of nestled in nature; it’s beautiful.”

Kovar said she has seen a significant increase in tourism to Makanda since the COVID-19 pandemic, with people not flying as much, but also wanting to get out of the house and into the outdoors.

Makanda also made it onto the map, Kovar said, because of the total solar eclipse that took place on April 8, 2024. A few shops down from Kovar, artist Dave Dardis painted a line through his shop to represent the path of totality at the time.

Dardis is better known as the Rainmaker, a name he shares with his bronze art studio. A backdoor in Dardis’ shop opens out to his secret garden, a poorly kept secret in Makanda.

The garden features lush greenery and natural elements interwoven with bronze sculptures. Sweeney, a self-described whimsical person, said her visit to Dardis’ not-so-secret garden was the best part of her southern Illinois experience.

“That’s like walking into a literal fairy tale,” Sweeney said. “He’s like a hermit slash hippie slash, I don’t know, man with wisdom,” Sweeney added of Dardis. “He almost reminds me of a sage, like, you know those giant trees that talk?”

Having grown up in the area, tourism influencer Baine is well aware of the traditional engines for local economies — whether that’s coal mining or agriculture. But she sees a path for tourism to become an even bigger factor in time.

“There’s coal mines and there’s all these very blue-collar jobs, but tourism brings even more money to our region. Tourists are spending money at restaurants, at the wineries, and they can reinvest in our communities,” Baine said.

“When you live and breathe southern Illinois, and your kid goes to school here,” she said, “you want these businesses to thrive.”

As schools prepare for the next academic year, a Supreme Court decision allowing religious parents to opt out of LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction will likely push educators to rethink how they approach inclusive content. 
Some teachers may shy away from teaching about topics religious families may object to, while others could look for ways to maintain inclusivity in the classroom while complying with opt-out requests. 
The Supreme Court, in its 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor, sided with religious parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who sought the right to opt their children out of LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction. The court said the Montgomery County school district’s policy, which prevented opt-out for LGBTQ+ inclusive storybooks, interfered with a parent’s right to “direct the religious upbringing of their children.” A federal appeals court will continue to review the case. 
Advocates for inclusive curriculum fear Friday’s decision lays the foundation for parents nationwide to opt their children out of material that they say conflicts with their religious beliefs — and could change how teachers approach teaching about inclusive content for all students. 
Some educators are already beginning to think about how they will adapt their curriculums in the face of the ruling and the federal push to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and the discussion of gender identity from schools. 
In a dissent joined by the two other liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that allowing students to opt out of any lesson plan or story time that might challenge their family’s religious beliefs will “impose impossible administrative burdens on schools.”
“The result will be chaos for this Nation’s public schools,” Sotomayor wrote. 
Some believe giving parents the right to opt their children out of lessons will not drastically change public education. Most schools, including those in Montgomery County, already allow kids to skip lessons related to sex education or human sexuality. A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that nearly half of K-12 teachers support parents’ rights to opt their children out of learning about sexual orientation and gender identity at school — suggesting that many would be willing to accommodate such requests.
Yet, a 2024 survey by the RAND corporation found that only 3% of teachers thought that limits on discussing race or gender in the classroom had a positive impact on their students. Ten times as many teachers thought these limitations had a negative effect. 
Nearly two-thirds of teachers reported self-censoring how they talk about certain social and political issues in the classroom due to parental pushback, job security, and unclear guidelines. As a result, teachers felt they were unable to provide students the opportunity to learn from different perspectives or see their own identities represented. 
Opt-outs may change inclusive education for everyone 
If the Mahmoud v. Taylor ruling sparks an increase in opt-out requests, educators’ workloads could easily double as they are pushed to create separate activities and instructional materials for students who have opted out. 
“These students aren’t just going to sit around the hallway waiting. They have to be engaged,” said Stacie Brensilver Berman, a clinical assistant professor in the Teaching and Learning department at New York University Steinhardt and a veteran high school teacher. “That is a lot of work, and it’s a lot to ask.”
Rather than create a separate curriculum for students based on opt-out status, many teachers may choose to forgo the LGBTQ+ material altogether. 
Originally, Montgomery County Public Schools allowed parents to opt out of books explicitly centering on LGBTQ+ themes such as “Love, Violet,” a story about a girl who worries her same-sex crush won’t like the valentine she made for her, and “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” which follows a girl tentative about her uncle’s marriage to his boyfriend. However, a year after the curriculum was introduced, the district changed its policy citing in part that individual principals and teachers could not accommodate the growing number of opt-out requests. 
Tiferet Ani, a former teacher and content specialist at Montgomery County Public Schools who now sits on the board of History UnErased, a national provider of LGBTQ-inclusive history curriculum, believes students shouldn’t be deprived of the opportunity to learn about the existence of LGBTQ+ people and the fact that they have the legal right to exist and marry. 
Ani adds that kids are likely to be exposed to LGBTQ+ identities regardless of whether it’s taught in the classroom. If kids don’t have access to LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction in the classroom, Ani said, students will miss out on “the opportunity to have that dialogue with a teacher rather than on a playground.” 
In addition, public schools should prepare students for the real world, “not a sanitized version of it,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of National Parents Union. Rodrigues is afraid the absence of LGBTQ+ inclusive material in schools will deprive students of “the opportunity of being prepared to interact with people who are different from them, to learn from them, and to be able to be cooperative and successful in society.”
But not everyone agrees that inclusivity should be a goal of public schooling. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats believe public schools should teach children to embrace differences, compared with just over a third of Republicans. 
“A classroom environment that is welcoming to all students is something to be commended,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote on behalf of the majority. “But such an environment cannot be achieved through hostility toward the religious beliefs of students and their parents.” 
Group work, projects: some ways teachers can adapt lessons
Teachers can find ways to accommodate opt-out requests and embed inclusivity in their curriculum without taking on additional work, according to Berman who has worked closely with teachers to introduce potentially controversial topics into the classroom. 
She says small-group work and projects can be easy alternatives that allow teachers to cover material without infringing on opt-out requests. 
Teachers can provide students with a list of LGBTQ+ inclusive project topics, so everyone in the class can work on the same assignment with room for individualization. For younger students in kindergarten and first grade, Berman says kids can work in groups or stations so some might be working on an art activity in one part of the room while others listen to a read-aloud. 
Educators can also normalize inclusion in everyday instruction, says Jocardo Ralston, a veteran New York City teacher working with History UnErased. As an example, he points out that it’s impossible to talk about computer science without acknowledging the contributions of Alan Turing, a World War II codebreaker often credited as the “father of theoretical computer science.” Turing was prosecuted by the British Government for homosexuality, which was illegal at the time in Great Britain. 
Before parents opt their child out of LGBTQ+ material, Rodrigues encourages families who are concerned about what’s being taught in the classroom to engage in a meaningful conversation with their teacher and principal and look at the books in the curriculum themselves. But she also insists that educators and school districts need to be open and transparent about what is being taught in classrooms so that parents can understand the goals of their instruction.

A Hartford woman never saw her car again after it was towed while she sat in housing court fighting an eviction.
A home care worker had her car towed while she hurried to assist a patient down the stairs. 
A young man lost his car and slipped into financial instability after he mistakenly put his apartment’s parking sticker in the wrong spot.
Late last month, Connecticut lawmakers, following a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica, passed sweeping reforms to the state’s towing laws that will address many of the issues drivers have complained about. The stories highlighted how towing companies can begin the process to sell people’s cars after 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country.
Reporters heard from dozens of drivers across Connecticut who had to pay exorbitant fees or had their vehicles sold when they couldn’t afford the charges. Many told reporters about the severe consequences they experienced after their cars were towed or sold, including the loss of jobs, personal mementos and housing.
While some people’s cars might not have been towed under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1, it doesn’t solve all the problems that vehicle owners raised.
Here are some of their stories, as well as whether the changes in the new law would have helped them.
Towing Home Health Aides
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Home care worker Maria Jiménez circled the Hartford apartment complex for low-income seniors, looking for a place to park. Jiménez drives patients to and from errands like doctor’s appointments and grocery shopping. Her patient that day last November used a cane, and Jiménez planned to park close so that her patient wouldn’t have to walk too far.
Unsuccessful, Jiménez stopped in front of the building’s entrance. 
“I turned on the hazard lights and left the car on, just long enough to let her know I had arrived, since I didn’t have her phone number,” she said. Jiménez said she told a few bystanders she would be right back and asked them to keep an eye on her car. 
She said she went inside only briefly, and when she returned, the car was gone. Bystanders told Jiménez the car had been towed and that they’d pleaded with the truck’s driver, to no avail.
Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO at Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, said many of her members complain about getting ticketed or towed when they’re doing their jobs helping people.
When it happens frequently enough at a particular complex, she said, an agency might speak with the landlord to ask for a designated spot. But there isn’t a statewide mandate.
New Jersey passed a law in 2018 allowing home health care workers, visiting nurses and others to apply for a placard similar to an accessible parking tag to place in their cars.
“Maybe we can talk to the legislators off session to see if there’s anything we can do,” Wodatch said.
The company that towed Jiménez, MyHoopty.com, was in Watertown, and Jiménez was stranded over 30 miles away in Hartford. “How will I get there if I don’t have a car?” she recalled thinking.
MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said the vehicle was parked in the fire lane without its hazard lights on for 17 minutes before it was towed and that the apartment complex had hired MyHoopty to prevent such parking violations.  
“This is a critical safety issue, particularly at an elderly housing complex where the emergency access can be a matter of life and death,” Festa said. (MyHoopty has appeared in other stories in our series.)
The apartment complex owners didn’t respond to calls and emails for comment. 
Jiménez said she makes about $290 a week. By the time she got to MyHoopty, the company told her the bill was more than $400.
Her husband footed the bill. But it wasn’t easy: “The only reason I could afford it is because I work mornings, I work nights,” he said.
Short Meters and Unpaid Tickets
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Marie Franklin paid the parking meter and dashed into Hartford housing court for a December 2023 hearing that would determine if she would get evicted from her apartment. She worried about the parking. People can wait for hours for the judge to call their cases, but the Hartford Parking Authority limits nearby meters to two hours.
So people facing eviction sometimes run the risk of getting a parking violation, getting their cars towed or missing their names being called for hearings, which can cause them to lose their housing in a default judgement for not showing up to court.
Joshua Michtom, a Hartford City Council member and an attorney who has represented children and parents in juvenile court, said although there’s a nearby parking garage, it’s more expensive and it fills up.
“You have to be there, but then you don’t know how long you’re going to have to wait,” Michtom said. “And the courts are not particularly forgiving if you’re not there the moment your case gets called.”
When Franklin’s name was finally called, a judge rejected her plea to stave off eviction. Dejected and stressed about losing her home, she walked out of court only to discover her 2015 Volvo was gone. Franklin had more than a dozen unpaid parking tickets, some of which were nearly 20 years old. She’d forgotten about some, and others were for vehicles she no longer owned. About half of the tickets were for exceeding the meter limit or parking over the line near the courthouse.
“I had paid for the parking meter and everything,” Franklin said. “They drive around, and they look for people’s cars.”

Jill Turlo, CEO of the Hartford Parking Authority, said the agency’s officers use license plate scanners to find people with outstanding tickets. Turlo said “high-traffic metered areas,” like the street the courthouse is on, are “regularly patrolled by parking enforcement.” Turlo said that the parking authority has not received any requests to extend the time for metered parking near the courthouses.
While towing cars for unpaid parking tickets is a common practice for cities, Minnesota passed a law last year barring such tows, seeing them as an unfair burden on low-income families. Several cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, have also stopped such tows after a California appeals court ruled that towing cars for unpaid parking tickets violated people’s rights against warrantless seizures, said Rebecca Miller, an attorney with the Western Center on Law & Poverty.
Hartford has one of the strictest policies in Connecticut. A city ordinance allows tows after two or more unpaid tickets that date back to September 2012. Other cities including Danbury and New Britain don’t tow for unpaid tickets. Norwalk and Waterbury will tow if there are four unpaid tickets; Stamford tows for three unpaid tickets or more than $250 owed, officials in those cities said. The limit in Bridgeport is $100, and New Haven’s is $200.
“We do have an ordinance where we can boot a car for unpaid tickets, but we haven’t used it in years,” said Deborah Pacific, director of the Danbury Parking Authority.
When Franklin went to eviction court, she had been trying to hold onto the place she and her daughter lived while she looked for a new job. Between unpaid fines, late fees, and towing and storage charges, it would have cost almost $3,000 to get her car back, she said.
“I would have chose to pay whatever I owed to my housing. So my car, there was nothing I could do,” Franklin said.
The vehicle was towed by Metro Auto Body & Towing, which did not return calls and emails for comment. It was later sold by the lender.
After losing her car and housing, Franklin moved to Florida to stay with her son.
Parking Sticker in the Wrong Place
Fixed: Apartment residents now have 72 hours if caught without a parking permit or with an expired one.
It’s often little discrepancies that lead to big consequences. When Tishawn Tillman moved into his Hartford apartment in September, he got a parking sticker that allowed him to park in the building’s private lot. He said he wasn’t sure where to put it, so he stuck it on the driver’s side window. 
But less than a month later, his car was towed by Cross Country Automotive in Hartford.
“There is absolutely no legal documentation in my lease that says that this has to be strictly on the windshield,” Tillman said.
Minor rule violations such as parking crooked or not backing into a space have caused people’s cars to be towed and then sold when they couldn’t afford the fees. Stories like Tillman’s drove legislators to act. Under the new law, the towing company would have had to warn Tillman, giving him 72 hours to get a new sticker and place it in the right spot. The law also says towers have to get permission from the apartment complex to tow a vehicle unless it’s blocking traffic or parked in a fire lane.
Tillman said he assumed his car had been stolen. But the police told him it had been towed.
Tillman contacted Cross Country: “I asked them, ‘Did you see my sticker?’ And they said, ‘We didn’t see the sticker.’” He said he called the apartment manager, but he wouldn’t help.
“When I realized that neither of the parties were going to budge on the matter, I told them that I wasn’t going to pay the fine, even if I had the money, which I didn’t at the time,” Tillman said.
Tillman said his bill was “$200 but growing every day.”
He filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office, which said it unsuccessfully tried to resolve the issue through its voluntary mediation program and recommended he complain to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Sal Sena, Cross Country’s owner, submitted a letter to the attorney general saying there are signs all over the parking lot explaining the rules. The apartment manager, Jack Matos, wrote to the attorney general that he talked with Sena about giving TIllman a discount on the towing fees.
“I reiterated Tishawn needs to make sure that it’s placed on the windshield,” Matos wrote.
Frustrated, Tillman eventually gave up trying to get his car back.
“I went from being a self-made young man with his own apartment and car to having to burn a hole in my pocket just to get to and from work on ride-share services like Uber and Lyft,” he said.
Unable to Reclaim Car Despite Having the Title
Fixed: The law allows vehicle owners to reclaim their cars with other documents besides DMV registration.
Shaleah Carr needed two more weeks until her DMV appointment in April to register the Chevrolet Malibu she had just bought from her mom. It was the earliest appointment she could get.
Her boyfriend had taken the car to his brother’s house to work on it when they decided to take it for a test drive. But the car broke down on U.S. Route 5 in South Windsor, and police called for a tow. 
Her boyfriend told the tow truck driver that the car was registered to Carr’s mother and that Carr had the title and proof of insurance. But the towing company, Tolland Automotive, wouldn’t release the vehicle to Carr because she wasn’t the registered owner, said the company’s owner, George Fellows. The vehicle was towed on a Friday afternoon, and by the time Carr was able to get to the lot on Monday morning, she owed more than $300.
“I told them I’m on one income and I can’t afford it,” Carr said. “I just paid my rent for that month, and I even asked, ‘Do you guys do payments?’” 
Since then, her Malibu has been sitting in the company’s lot.

Carr’s dilemma has happened to people whose cars have been towed across Connecticut — they’ve been unable to quickly register their cars and then blocked from reclaiming them because they’re not registered in their names yet. By the time they can register their cars, so much time has passed that the tow bill is too expensive or the company has sold their car.
The new law gives consumers time to register their car before it can be towed and requires towers to release vehicles if presented with the title or a bill of sale as proof of ownership. The law also requires towers to accept other forms of payment besides cash and demands towers have business hours on weekends so fees don’t accrue while they’re closed.
Fellows said police called them to the scene. “Then we found out that this guy didn’t own the car at all,” Fellows said. Without the owner there, “it had to come back to our shop.”
Carr called her mother. “I was like, ‘You’re going to have to come up here,’ but even if she does, she can’t really do much,” Carr said. “She didn’t have the money to get it back either.”
Carr said the last time she called Tolland Automotive, the bill was $800. Given that she paid her mother only $500 for the car, she said, it almost wasn’t worth trying to get it back anymore.
Fellows said Carr’s mother did come into the office earlier this month with proof of registration, and he is willing to release the vehicle if she pays what is owed.
“It’s all on them,” he said. “I mean they knew what the issue was back then. Why haven’t they come back?”

Registry shows only 22% of owners have a primary mailing address in town.

This story by Aaron Calvin and Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 26.
Data from Stowe’s new short-term rental registry, which went live at the beginning of May, shows that most of those properties’ owners don’t live in town full-time.
Of the 891 registrants who provided the town of Stowe with information about their rental properties as of late May, just 196, or 22 percent, listed their “owner mailing address” in Stowe.
Another 86 registrants have mailing addresses listed in Vermont. Nearly as many properties — 260 — are registered to Massachusetts mailing addresses.
According to assistant town manager Will Fricke, about 90 short-term rental owners have failed to respond to mailed requests that they participate in the registry.
The registry requirement was codified last year, after a 3-2 majority of the Stowe Selectboard voted to pass an ordinance that would establish a short-term rental regulation. That ordinance requires property owners to share information about themselves and their property managers with the town and adhere to certain regulations for public safety purposes.
The ordinance was opposed tooth and nail by a class of rental owners and property managers who were able to petition for a public referendum on the law. A town meeting held in May 2024 saw Stowe residents overwhelmingly support — in a 435-240 vote — the establishment of a town registry.
The data collected in the registry reveals what many advocates for the proposal suspected: there are many short-term rentals in Stowe and most of them are owned by non-residents. What implications this has for Stowe’s housing access needs, an ongoing subject of analysis and public discussion from the formation of the new town plan to the town’s nascent housing task force, remains to be determined.
Selectboard reactions
Stowe selectboard members said it’s too early to draw conclusions about the registry, but next month’s highly-anticipated report from the housing task force — after a year-long charge to study housing in Stowe — could spark selectboard discussions about short-term rentals and other housing topics.
According to emails between town manager Charles Safford and Jeff Sauser of CommunityScale, a housing consultant who outlined a timeline for Stowe’s registry and other housing goals, the selectboard wants to wait until next year to discuss the results of the registry, after gathering a year’s worth of data.
Short-term rental property owners in Stowe aren’t required to register with the town until their property becomes active, so a year’s worth of data would give the town a full picture of how many properties there are in Stowe. But with a good chunk of properties already registered, selectboard chair Paco Aumand said the board might want to discuss the registry sooner than a year.
“Creating the registry has accomplished what it was set out to do, and that is provide valuable data around how many short-term rentals we really have in Stowe,” Aumand, who initially voted against the registry, said. “Now it’s time to take a hard look at what that means in terms of action.”
For Aumand, the ultimate goal is to boost Stowe’s full-time population, which aligns with the town plan and stated public opinion. But targeting short-term rentals is just one tool in the toolbox, according to McKee Macdonald, chair of the housing task force. He pointed to other tools like deed restrictions, new housing development, or establishing a housing reserve fund.
Sauser agreed.
“Short-term rentals have been a popular topic in Stowe for years, but there are many more housing ideas that frankly haven’t been baked through,” he said. “We don’t want the conversation to start and end with short-term rentals.”
Rep. Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe, is in favor of short-term rentals for homesteaders, but not for out-of-staters or “private equity types looking to build a portfolio,” and he agreed with Sauser.
Lipsky advised against “scapegoating” short-term rentals for Stowe’s housing crisis. He admits they play a role, but they’re also an important revenue source for some working-class families in Stowe.
“We could take every short-term rental off the market tomorrow, but then who in Vermont could afford to buy those properties?” Lipsky said. “The solution must be multifaceted.”
Next month’s housing task force report will offer a slate of options for the selectboard — including how the board might deal with short-term rentals in Stowe — rather than specific recommendations, McKee said. From there, it’s up to the selectboard to decide on a path.
Selectboard member Ethan Carlson said that while the registry validates some of the assumptions around short-term rentals and their impact on Stowe’s housing market, the board still needs to take its time rolling out potential policy changes.
Carlson, echoing some of Lipsky’s comments, is sensitive to property rights of short-term rental owner and the 196 properties that are registered with Stowe addresses, some of which might be operated by longtime Stowe residents looking to bump up their income.
“I’d like to see the process play out,” Carlson said, referencing the task force’s upcoming report, “I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that short-term rentals would be the first action or the most logical until we kind of look at the situation holistically.”
Few big owners
Of the 891 property owners currently registered as part of the Stowe registry, 64 of them own two or more of those properties, but few own more than five.
Chuck and Jann Perkins — former “ski bums,” original owners of the Alpine Shop in South Burlington and inductees to the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, to which they made a million-dollar donation in 2023 — are technically Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners by volume.
The Perkinses, whose primary residence is in Burlington, have registered 10 short-term rentals with the town of Stowe. All of them are condominiums located in a single building at The Lodge at Spruce Peak, the mountainside complex that features a mix of seasonal lodging, traditional hospitality and other amenities.
The couple began acquiring condos at Spruce Peak as it was being built at the turn of the century, and each time they sold a property elsewhere in town and didn’t know what to acquire next, they would pick up another and, over time, they have accumulated, Jann Perkins said.

They own 19 different properties in town, according to the Stowe grand list. She said they primarily rent those residences out on a long-term basis, and the tenants have lived in them for years. She added they may be primarily Burlington residents, but they spend most weekends in Stowe, where they are devoted members of the Stowe Community Church.
Sam Gaines, Spruce Peak Realty president, declined to say how many properties are managed as short-term rentals by the company, but a property manager with Stowe Mountain Rentals told Fricke in an email related to the short-term rental registry that the company manages more than 45 properties at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
Gaines argued that the Spruce Peak condos, like the ones the Perkinses own, shouldn’t be considered housing units in the traditional sense, but are essentially hotel rooms. With hoteliers in Stowe managing rooms or condominiums on sites like Airbnb and VRBO, the line is increasingly a blurred one.
“Practically, we do not believe they are ‘short-term rental’ units. However, the town adopted a very unusual definition of (short-term rentals) to include hotel rooms that are owned through a condominium governance structure,” Gaines said. “We believe this is bad policy and inconsistent with most similar municipal regulations around the country.”
Another one of Stowe’s larger short-term rental owners, Ryan Rabidou, who owns five, also uses them as part of his hospitality business, Om Home Residences.
Colin Moffatt, a Stowe resident and coach at Mt. Mansfield Academy, is also among the town’s largest short-term rental owners, with six residential units in two different buildings in the heart of Stowe village.
Jose Saavedra, one of Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners and who is primarily based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, operates five short-term rentals across three separate properties. Saavedra owns nine properties through his limited-liability company in Stowe, a downsizing from the 17 residential units he owned in 2022.
Saavedra became an illustrative example of the ways in which the short-term rental market could affect housing access in the resort town after a 93-year-old was forced to leave his residence after Saavedra decided to convert the rental from long to short-term.

The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kenyon Bolton: The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ will make Vermont’s primary care shortage even worse.","This commentary is by Kenyon Bolton. He is an internal medicine physician who lives in East Montpelier.


It is already difficult to find a new primary care clinician in Vermont. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” making its way through the U.S. Congress will likely make it harder thanks to its proposed Medicaid work requirements and more frequent eligibility recertifications. 
I am an internal medicine physician who works in hospital medicine. I love primary care and volunteer in an outpatient clinic, but chose employment in the hospital setting in part due to the administrative burdens increasingly placed on primary care. 
Primary care clinicians already have the unenviable task of gatekeeping many social services. When not in the exam room, they are completing paperwork for their patients’ disability determination for social security, special education services, substance use disorder support, home health services, housing and food assistance and family medical leave, in addition to onerous tasks related to documentation and insurance.
A well-staffed office works hard to help manage this load, but the pile of paperwork ends up on your doctor’s desk next to critical lab results, radiology findings, prior authorizations and medical charting.
The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Compared to countries with more robust social safety nets and universal healthcare, U.S. physicians spend more time on administrative tasks, including screening for and managing social issues. Based on a recent survey compiled by the Vermont Medical Society, we know that Vermont clinicians report burnout just from prior authorizations alone. Vermont physician leaders have recently sounded the alarm regarding these cumulative pressures on primary care. 
With its enactment of Medicaid work requirements, the bill will double down on bureaucratic burdens for primary care, not to mention the Americans who depend on Medicaid. As written, the House bill would exempt “medically frail” people from work requirements, which will likely require clinician approval.
Additionally, the bill requires more frequent Medicaid eligibility recertifications, up from annually to every six months. This is a known contributor to “enrollment churn,” where enrollees lose and regain coverage. Churn increases administrative costs to states, ups the number of ED visits and hospitalizations, and swells burdens on both practices and patients.
Not only will the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likely lead to increased mortality, put rural hospitals at risk of closing, and cause confusion for patients, it will probably increase the administrative burden on your primary care office. I’m not the only doctor who has steered away from primary care because of its unwieldy administrative demands as things stand, and we should all expect Vermont’s primary care shortage to worsen with this bill. 
In recent VTDigger commentaries, Alex Messinger urged Vermonters to connect with their family and friends in red states to oppose the bill’s cuts to clean energy incentives, and Dr. Julie Ehrlich at UVM has highlighted the bill’s impact on pediatric care.Additionally, we can urge Gov. Phil Scott to join our federal delegation in vocally opposing the One Big Beautiful Bill for the sake of our state’s primary care practices. I was glad to see that he did not join his Republican colleagues in supporting the bill. Let’s take the next step and call on him to join the bipartisan opposition to Medicaid cuts.

On Tuesday, the gasoline tax will rise by six cents a gallon, the first increase in nine years for the primary revenue source sustaining Washington’s transportation system.
The hike is the most prominent piece of a six-year, $3.2 billion package passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this year. 
Lawmakers turned to the tax to contend with a projected $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year transportation budget. Officials said this was caused by an inflation-fueled surge in construction costs and flattening gas tax receipts as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and as cars have become more fuel efficient.
“This will keep projects on track and ensure the promises we’ve made can be kept,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “As you drive around and see those orange cones, that’s where your money is at work.”
Tuesday’s increase will push the state’s per-gallon tax rate on gas and other vehicle fuels from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. Starting July 1, 2026, it will rise each year by 2% — about a penny annually — to account for inflation.
Also Tuesday, the state tax on diesel will climb an additional three cents, so 9 cents total, to 58.4 cents, then go up another three cents two years later. That additional six cents applied to diesel will be subject to a 2% boost each year starting July 1, 2028.
Washington will have the nation’s third highest state gas tax behind California and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is currently at 52.4 cents, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
Washington’s state tax is on top of federal fuel taxes, which are 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel.
Hiking the gas tax is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax is counted on to bring in $166 million over that time.
These increases are two of the larger entrees in the transportation package’s smorgasbord of new taxes and higher fees.
Under the legislation, passenger vehicle weight fees are going up a few dollars. The added sales tax for vehicles will climb from 0.3% to 0.5%. 
There’s also a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000 and a 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000. 
There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax as well, from 5.9% to 11.9%, before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
And there’s more.
The tire disposal fee will go from $1 apiece to $5 apiece. Washington State Ferries will boost its vessel replacement surcharge by 50 cents in October and start imposing a 3% fee for those who pay with credit cards next year. 
This week’s increase in gas and diesel taxes may not be immediately noticeable.
The state collects those taxes before fuel gets pumped. They are paid by the distributor — the business that buys or imports gasoline and transports it to the neighborhood gas station. Distributors will decide how they pass their costs onto the station owner, who must decide if they will pass on any added costs to customers. 
Washington created a motor vehicle fuel tax in 1921. It applied to special fuels, too, according to the state Department of Licensing.
The last gas tax boost totalled 11.9 cents and anchored the Connecting Washington transportation package passed by the Legislature in 2015. It led to increases of 7 cents per gallon in July 2015 and 4.9 cents a year later. 
Washington gas prices are higher now than a year ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.45 on Friday compared to $4.33 in 2024, according to AAA. Nationally, the average price was $3.20 on Friday.
Critics of the state’s Climate Commitment Act, which requires refineries and other businesses to pay for their air pollution, say that law has pushed up gas prices in recent years.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gas-prices-at-pump-washington-state--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

(Getty Images)A decade after Indiana overhauled its criminal code to reduce incarceration, lawmakers approved more than a dozen new crimes and sentencing enhancements. 
The new laws, set to take effect July 1, were passed in this year’s long legislative session. Among the changes are stricter sentences for fentanyl-related offenses, harsher penalties for resisting law enforcement and criminalizing swatting – or falsely reporting an emergency.   
The Indiana Department of Correction is nearing full capacity according to a recent prison population report. As of June, state prison facilities were operating at 94.38% capacity – with one prison over 100% full. The system currently houses 25,305 inmates, with a total of 26,812 beds. 
“This is a policy decision you have to make,” Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce said. “Do you spend your resources incarcerating people for decades in a state prison, or do you spend your resources on treating the underlying causes of the crime.”
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The DOC is spending billions on a new prison and also has struggled to keep up with costs it owes to local county jails.
In 2014, Gov. Mike Pence signed a major criminal code reform bill to reduce prison populations and save millions in correctional costs. The bill also prioritized mental health and rehabilitation programs for lower-level offenders. Prior to the bill, a comprehensive review of the criminal code had not been done in almost 40 years. 
The bill requires the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute to annually gather data and analyze the impact of Indiana criminal code reform on local units of government, the DOC and the judicial system.
Lawmakers haven’t been shy about adding new crimes and sentences to the criminal justice landscape in Indiana. 
Pierce, who co-authored the reform bill, said newer members of the General Assembly have reverted into the old way of thinking – the idea that every year an additional sentence is added on to a crime, the crime will go down. 
“If you want to reduce crime, you can’t simply do the easy thing,” he said. “Which is to increase the penalty and then walk away and say ‘you solve the problem.’”
  Chris Naylor, executive director of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council.
Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council Executive Director Chris Naylor said it’s not new laws that are creating issues for the DOC but the amount of violent offenders and attorney shortages. 
“Over the last 10 years, there’s been over a 40% increase in murders,” Naylor said. “And so it’s not much any new laws that are having this impact, it is the level of violent crimes that increasing in our state.” 
Naylor said caseloads show the state needs 384 more attorneys to cover cases. He said the salaries of deputy prosecutors are lagging way behind any other public service attorney or private sector attorney. 
Indiana has a growing statewide lawyer shortage especially in rural counties. Over half of the state’s counties are considered “legal deserts,” and have fewer than one attorney per 1,000 Hoosiers. In 2024, the Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future was created to address attorney shortages. They have until July 1 to submit a final report.
 Fentanyl penalty increased

A key factor in this year’s legislation was fentanyl. Indiana’s drug overdose crisis has worsened since the 2014 reforms and fentanyl came after code reform, Pierce said. In 2022, there were a total of 2,682 overdose deaths with 72% involving fentanyl or other synthetic opioids in Indiana, according to USAFacts. 
In response, Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, authored a public safety bill that increases penalties for fentanyl-related crimes. It passed with bipartisan support. 
“Public safety has always been one of my top priorities as a Senator,” Freeman said in a press release. “This bill was not created to put additional burdens on government agencies, but to keep violent criminals off the streets of our Hoosier communities. Soft-on-crime prosecuting and bail policies are hurting innocent people in many cities, including Indianapolis.”
Pierce disagrees with the bill. He also said he does not see a major criminal code reform happening anytime soon but one might be necessary if the legislature continue on the path of adding new penalties and enhancements.
“I think it was a mistake to do the new enhancements on fentanyl,” Pierce said. 
 Naylor called the fentanyl provision an appropriate response. He said our drug statutes work based on the different weights of the drug. 
“The old weights just were antiquated when you’re dealing with a substance as potent and as deadly as fentanyl, so that made total sense,” Naylor said. 
 Other crimes

Zach Stock, legislative counsel for the Indiana Public Defender Council, said his group generally opposes new crimes or enhancements. 
House Enrolled Act 1014 increases the penalty for resisting law enforcement, a charge Stock says appears in thousands of cases each year. The same law also restricts government entities from hosting or organizing obscene performances. 
“Every time we tinker with the code in one isolated area, we lose sight of the whole code,” Stock said. “But we still can’t blame the crisis on new crimes or enhancements.”
Swatting will now be a Level 6 felony in Indiana. This change comes from Senate Enrolled Act 198 authored by Freeman and Sen. Eric Koch. 
“The bill was necessary because existing law didn’t define the conduct to allow for effective prosecution. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing amount of swatting around the country, and this was necessary to protect the safety of our citizens,” Koch said. 
Previously the punishment was a class A misdemeanor, a max of one year in prison. A person facing a Level 6 felony could spend up to two and a half years in prison. 
A new crime was introduced this year that lawmakers would have never envisioned ten years ago – signal jamming, a device that disrupts communications. SEA 26 makes it a Level 5 felony if someone uses a signal jammer to disrupt a critical infrastructure facility or the communications of a public safety agency. 
Another law makes it a Level 6 felony for a passenger of a vehicle to point a firearm during the commission of the driver’s criminal recklessness.

New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.","Steve Woodruff, operations manager, looks over the reservation system at Commander’s Palace.

Editor’s Note: In May, Gov. Joe Lombardo signed Senate Bill 169, which prohibits third-party reservation websites from listing restaurants without their permission. The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, passed the Legislature unanimously and goes into effect later this year, on Oct. 1.
The following story, originally published by Stateline, provides insight into the issue, which is affecting restaurants in popular dining destinations across the country. 			


NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Seems almost quaint.
Take a look, if you can stomach it, at Florida’s sitting attorney general, one James Uthmeier Esq.
A federal judge has held him in contempt for violating a court order halting SB 4C — last session’s bill allowing the state to arrest anyone who might kinda sorta look “illegal.”
Brown folks rounded up by handcuff-happy cops included at least one American citizen.
Uthmeier took to X, proclaiming, “If being held in contempt is what it costs to defend the rule of law and stand firmly behind President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration, so be it.”
Older readers will detect an echo of former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who did her damnedest to stall ballot recounts in the great Gore-Bush imbroglio of 2000, and who would grandly quote the Biblical Queen Esther, “If I perish, I perish.”
The AG appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, half of whom were appointed by Trump. They told him (in judicial language) to get lost.
 Scofflaw history
Uthmeier’s lucky U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams didn’t fine him or throw his arrogant backside in jail.
Still, it’s early days: Hope Florida, the nonprofit founded by the state’s ambitious First Lady, is under investigation by North Florida State’s Attorney Jack Campbell. Uthmeier is up to his eyeballs in this one.
State Rep. Alex Andrade (R-Pensacola) has accused Uthmeier of criminal fraud and money laundering.
Seems Hope Florida got a $10 million “donation” of taxpayer money, of which a good chunk went to a PAC controlled by Uthmeier.
You can’t use that money for political purposes; nevertheless, that’s just what Uthmeier’s PAC did, spending it on ads to defeat last year’s recreational marijuana amendment.
DeSantis hadn’t yet elevated Uthmeier, then his chief of staff, to the AG job, but still: The guy was an officer of the court, a member of the Florida Bar.
You’d think he’d get it.
Then again, Florida under DeSantis is not known for adherence to the rule of law.
Remember in 2022 when the governor tricked a bunch of Venezuelan asylum seekers onto a plane and flew them to Martha’s Vineyard? Legally dubious? Ethically ugly? Yes and yes.
De Santis is also the guy who suspended one state attorney for saying he wouldn’t pursue abortion cases and another because, he claimed, she wouldn’t enforce state law.
“State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law,” he said. “Not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda,” adding that those outlaw prosecutors were “basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done.”
Yet when James Uthmeier said he wouldn’t enforce a statute passed by the Legislature, namely, Florida’s 2018 law forbidding anyone under 21 to buy a long gun, the governor shrugged.
He said that law is unconstitutional anyway and that Uthmeier’s stance was a “good-faith position.”
What’s the difference? The two state attorneys he suspended are Democrats.
Besides, as Floridians all know, the sacred right to pack heat matters more than actual human beings like the two people killed by a white supremacist Trumper on the FSU campus in April.
Unfortunately for us, DeSantis and his enablers aren’t particularly troubled by a bit of violence, as long as it’s perpetrated by the right people.
While he initially criticized the Jan. 6 riot, calling it “unacceptable,” he soon fell in line with MAGA-speak, denying there was an “insurrection” of any kind and defending Trump’s role in what was clearly an attempted coup.
So what if a few Capitol police got roughed up? They were on the wrong side.
In Florida, we like cops to be on the right side, making sure Marxists, environmentalists, feminists, BLM radicals, LGBTQ-types, and other outside agitators get what’s coming to them.
And, according to the governor, citizens can play cop, too.
In advance of the No Kings protests on June 14, DeSantis decreed that any patriotic, God-fearing, Trump-voting motorist who felt threatened or even just mildly inconvenienced by those freaks marching in one of the 70-odd demonstrations across Florida had his permission to give ’em a little automotive nudge.
“If you drive off and you hit one of these people, that’s their fault for impinging on you,” he said. “You don’t have to sit there and just be a sitting duck and let the mob grab you out of your car and drag you through the streets.”
DeSantis clearly cut con law class the day they discussed freedom of assembly.
 Something in the water?
You begin to wonder if there’s something about Florida that encourages a complete disregard not just of decent behavior but of the rule of law.
Maybe it’s some kind of mosquito-borne illness? Maybe the toxic algae choking our waters emits a foul miasma that clouds the brain’s moral center?
Maybe it’s a fish problem, you know, rotting from the head down?
In any case, scofflaws flock to Florida like rats to a burger joint dumpster.
We’ve a long history of criminality: Al Capone hung out in Miami Beach, and Charles Ponzi sold worthless swampland to rubes dreaming of a life in “paradise.”
It’s no surprise the current occupant of the White House, a casino-bankrupting grifter with 34 felony convictions, chose Palm Beach County as his home.
For a brief period in history — way back there, from the 1960s to the 1990s — Florida was known as a good-government state, with leaders such as Reuben Askew, Bob Graham, and Lawton Chiles, who promoted education, conservation, and transparency.
Again, quaint.
In the past couple of decades, however, we’ve elected such prize porkers as a governor whose company perpetrated a huge Medicare and Medicaid fraud and an attorney general who saw nothing untoward in taking a $25,000 campaign contribution from Donald Trump then dropping an investigation into his shady “university.”
Rick Scott is now a U.S. senator; Pam Bondi is now the attorney general of the United States.
Bondi’s busy demonstrating how much she learned in Florida, doing her damnedest to destroy the separation of powers enumerated in the Constitution.
She’s suing every single federal judge in the state of Maryland for having the brass-faced gall to issue orders insisting on due process for people the Trump regime wants to deport.
Doing their job, in other words.
 Lawyers or lawless?
Meanwhile, back down here in the sunniest state with the shadiest government, DeSantis and Uthmeier are back with a brand new bad idea: “Alligator Alcatraz,” a huge ICE detention camp in the Everglades.
The state seized the land from Miami-Dade County to park a 5,000-bed facility bang in the middle of the state’s greatest environmental treasure.
Who cares if it’s legal? It sure ain’t moral.
Despite the state’s claims that the place won’t hurt the surrounding wetland ecosystem (apparently 5,000 people in housing pods won’t create any run-off and all the trucks and buses transporting people and supplies will not make a mark upon the land), it’s an assault on a vulnerable and irreplaceable place.
Remember that the next time you hear DeSantis’ bleating how he wants to “save” the Everglades.
DeSantis, Bondi, and Uthmeier may call themselves lawyers, but they are lawless.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaiceGujVUrVW4AA9pXF.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor.More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.



“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

The challenges facing our communities are daunting. The pace of technological, economic and social change is relentless. The pursuit of the resources needed to fuel progress and improve the quality of life is all-consuming.
As Indiana-based Sagamore Institute documented last year in its “Workforce 2040: Pathways to Prosperity” report, our state and our communities have arrived at a pivotal moment in history as powerful economic, demographic and technological trends converge.
Great opportunities lie ahead but also great challenges. How we tackle both at the local and state levels will largely shape the quality of life in cities and towns throughout Indiana in the years ahead.
The good news is that our mayors and other community leaders don’t have to face these challenges alone. We want to offer a way to help.
Goldsmith program
In April, Sagamore Institute announced the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Innovation in Local Government, an initiative that will recognize and support an Indiana community that is responding to today’s challenges with fresh thinking and forward-looking solutions
The award is named after former Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, long recognized as a national leader in delivering innovative solutions to local governments in our state and beyond.
The Goldsmith Prize is about innovation in the broadest sense: rethinking outdated processes, forging creative partnerships, designing smarter policies and improving service delivery in ways that make life better for residents.
It’s about celebrating what’s working – and sharing it so others can benefit. What succeeds in Vincennes may also help Richmond, Bluffton or Brazil.
The winning community will receive not only recognition but also practical support: a graduate student with expertise in the project’s focus area will be assigned to help lead implementation in 2026. The position will be funded through the prize via a one-year stipend.
Additional technical advice and information resources will be provided, along with a platform to share success stories, foster partnerships, and encourage replication and innovation across the state.
Applications for the Goldsmith Prize are now being accepted. The deadline to apply is July 31.
In August, a panel of leaders in the business sector, nonprofit organizations and government will review applications to determine three finalists. Leaders from those communities will be invited to give a presentation on Aug. 22. From those presentations, the inaugural winning community will be selected and announced at the Aim Ideas Summit in October in French Lick.
Sparking innovation
So, what does innovation look like?
As mayor of La Porte, one of us (Blair) approved a recommendation from the city engineer to use a comprehensive asset management system that evaluated the condition of every street in the city’s 113-mile network. Each road received a PASER score (1 to 10), enabling the city to rank streets from best to worst and develop a long-term plan that prioritized critical repairs while preserving roads in good shape.
It wasn’t flashy, but it was smart. This data-driven, proactive approach helped La Porte stretch limited resources further— and it later became the model for a now-required process in the state’s Community Crossings Matching Grant program.
That’s the kind of innovation we’re talking about — not just new gadgets or apps, but better ways of doing the work that matters most – whether that’s managing infrastructure, tackling housing or workforce challenges, improving customer service or strengthening civic trust.
How is your community rethinking how it serves residents? What partnerships, tools, policies or practices are helping you do more with less – and do it better?
We want to know, not only to recognize and reward your success but also to inform and inspire leaders in other communities.
Because we know how hard it can be to lead well when the pace of change is so intense. Because we know resources are perpetually tight.
And because we know that by working together in our communities and across our state, we can find the solutions to meet the enormous challenges that lie ahead.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”



Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice (Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In Missouri, we don’t just live with fewer healthcare options. We live with the knowledge that when help doesn’t come, it’s not an accident. It’s policy.
I’m a nurse. I’ve worked in rural hospitals, in short-staffed ICUs, in systems that have learned how to survive without actually protecting anyone. And what I see now is worse than neglect. It reflects a pattern of disinvestment that disproportionately harms the communities least able to withstand it.
When Missouri expanded Medicaid, it should have brought relief to communities long denied basic care. But expansion on paper doesn’t mean access in practice. Administrative backlogs, endless documentation hurdles, and network gaps continue to leave people stranded. In rural Missouri, I’ve seen patients with Medicaid cards still turned away. Expansion without infrastructure does not create equity, it creates the appearance of reform without its substance.
In 2020, Missouri voters passed Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. Lawmakers delayed implementation for nearly a year. That delay wasn’t just bureaucratic. It was ideological. The same political opposition continues to influence how care is distributed or withheld across the state.
To be clear, challenges in administering Medicaid are real. Eligibility redeterminations involve complex systems. Rural provider recruitment is difficult. Coordination between state agencies and federal requirements often creates delays that are frustrating for both patients and administrators.
But acknowledging these logistical hurdles does not excuse their persistence. Missouri’s failure is not in encountering difficulty. It is in choosing not to fix what has been broken for years. When barriers are allowed to persist despite known solutions, the outcome is not accidental.
Meanwhile, Missouri continues to use a provider tax shell game to draw down billions in federal Medicaid dollars. Hospitals get the financial boost. But there is no requirement that those dollars improve care, staff safety, or patient outcomes. The state collects its match. The money circulates. And the hospitals that serve the poorest communities still close.
According to the Leapfrog Group and the U.S. Office of Inspector General, preventable harm events including falls, infections, and medication errors are significantly more common in hospitals with chronic staffing shortages. While safety grades vary across Missouri, the pattern is clear: when staffing ratios fall, risks to patients rise.
When Noble Health shut down the hospital in Mexico, Missouri, in 2022, patients were given no notice. Staff were told by text message. The facility that once served 11,000 ER visits a year went dark overnight. The company had collected CARES Act funds and Medicaid reimbursements before walking away, leaving behind debt, missing records, and no services.
According to state officials, 12 rural hospitals have closed in Missouri since 2014, with a total of 21 hospital closures statewide during that period. More than a dozen others are at risk. OB units are disappearing. Behavioral health beds are gone. And the people left behind are expected to accept this as a funding issue, not a policy choice.
Between June 2023 and May 2024, 400,000 Missourians, including nearly 200,000 children, lost Medicaid coverage. The majority were still eligible but were removed due to procedural errors, incomplete paperwork, or system backlogs. This phenomenon, known as ‘churn,’ is well documented and largely preventable.
Missouri’s procedural termination rate has been among the highest in the country. During several months in 2023, more than 70% of terminations occurred for paperwork reasons rather than actual ineligibility, significantly above the national average.
These administrative failures have financial consequences. When coverage is lost due to technicalities, the state avoids paying for services and saves money. In rural Missouri, where local caseworkers are often nonexistent and providers are scarce, losing Medicaid means losing access altogether.
The Missouri Department of Social Services has long struggled with timely renewals and enrollment processing. But instead of investing in systems that protect continuity of care, the state has maintained systems that obscure accountability and allow breakdowns to persist without correction.
Clinics lose reimbursements. Hospitals reduce services. Patients disengage. Not from care, but from a system that seems designed to shed them.
This is often framed as fiscal responsibility, but in effect, it is policy negligence with life-altering consequences.
In towns like Mexico, Moberly and Kennett, residents already live hours from specialty care.
When the local ER shuts down, it is not just an inconvenience. It is a death sentence that arrives slowly through missed diagnoses, delayed stroke care, untreated infections and silent mental health crises.
Stroke centers disappear when hospitals downgrade. Cardiac care vanishes when chest pain is rerouted to the next county. For rural Missourians, the question is not just when care will arrive, but whether it will arrive in time to matter. This is not a new phenomenon.
A similar wave of closures followed Medicare payment reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. What is different now is how much more consolidated and extractive the system has become. What we are seeing in 2025 is not merely underinvestment, it is a systematic withdrawal of support, often driven by financial incentives misaligned with patient care.
I have watched patients wait twelve hours in ER hallways for a bed. I know of times where the early warning signs were missed because the nurse was covering too many patients. These are not rare exceptions. They are the predictable outcomes of chronic understaffing and systems that treat care as a cost center.
Missouri hospitals are facing a sustained staffing crisis.
In 2023, about 16% of registered nurse positions were vacant across the state. Rural hospitals have been hit especially hard, with turnover and burnout worsening year after year. In some Missouri facilities, nurses have reported caring for five or more patients in units designed for closer supervision, exceeding commonly accepted ratios for step-down care.
This is not a temporary problem. It reflects a chronic shortage that puts both patients and staff at risk. Unsafe staffing has become the norm, and no award or marketing campaign can disguise the consequences of underinvestment in the workforce.
We know what stabilizes care. Local hospitals. Fair reimbursement. Staff-to-patient ratios that protect workers and outcomes. Behavioral health beds. Transportation. Language access. These are not mysteries. They are choices.
Missouri must tie Medicaid dollars to measurable outcomes such as access, staffing and infrastructure. Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice.
Until then, rural patients will keep falling through cracks. That is not fiscal prudence. It is political malpractice. And we cannot afford to wait quietly for the next hospital to close.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424
,Missouri Independent,2025-06-30 10:45:41+00:00,Missouri Independent,Why Trump’s second trade war could be worse for US farmers,Mónica Cordero,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/06/30/why-trumps-second-trade-war-could-be-worse-for-us-farmers/,"For April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer on land her family has worked for almost 125 years in north-central Iowa, life is guided by a simple philosophy: “Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” It’s a mindset that has helped her navigate extreme weather, market shocks and trade disputes. But this year, Hemmes said, […]","A farmer harvests corn near Slater, Iowa. on Oct. 17, 2020 (Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch).For April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer on land her family has worked for almost 125 years in north-central Iowa, life is guided by a simple philosophy: “Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”
It’s a mindset that has helped her navigate extreme weather, market shocks and trade disputes.
But this year, Hemmes said, feels different: President Trump’s recent tariff hikes on nearly all major U.S. trading partners have escalated a trade war, fueling uncertainty that is hard to prepare for.
“If there’s all this uncertainty out there, how can we plan? We need a path forward,” Hemmes said. “It’s like changing a tire while we’re still driving down the road.”
U.S. farmers had to navigate a trade war during Trump’s first term, but did so after years of rising commodity prices and government aid.
During the first trade war, Hemmes, a soybean and corn farmer, was able to reduce her debt and invest in new equipment, giving her a cushion and leaving her in “pretty good shape.”
However, this second Trump trade war comes at a time when farmers are in a more vulnerable financial position.
Over the last four years, grain prices have been on a downward trend. Soybeans — a major U.S. export and a pillar of the Midwest economy — have lost 34% of their value on the international market. Net farm income, while still above pre-pandemic levels, has declined for three consecutive years.
At the same time, input prices for fertilizer, fuel and other essential supplies have surged over the past five years, squeezing farmer profit margins and putting added strain on operations.
“The big difference between the first trade war and now is our input prices. They’re a lot higher than they were,” Hemmes said.
Borrowing has also become significantly more expensive for farmers, as the average interest rates charged on loans for land purchases and farm operations have increased by over 40% since 2020.
“I’ve never seen a time where the level of policy uncertainty is as high as it is right now,” said Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri.
“You have all the normal uncertainties that farmers face just because of weather and so on. Now you’ve got this huge policy uncertainty as well. It may turn out well, or it may turn out very badly, and we just don’t know right now.”
Westhoff said the financial health of farmers facing this second trade war varies by sector, with crop producers in a challenging position, while the cattle sector is faring better thanks to higher prices.
“We’ve seen net returns to crop producers fall back to levels we hadn’t seen since before COVID,” Westhoff said. At the same time, he said, fixed costs are much higher, and land and machinery prices are up.
“At some point, something has to change. Either they have to get more income or they have to reduce some expenses.”
Fertilizer is one of a farmer’s most significant expenses and has sharply increased.
Ammonium fertilizer, used heavily for corn, increased by more than 15% over the past five years. Phosphorus and potassium, essential for soybeans, rose by over 10%, according to Farmdoc, a research initiative from the University of Illinois’ Department of Agriculture and Consumer Economics.
Diesel, vital for equipment and transport, has seen the second-largest price hike.
“Farmers spend a lot of money before we even put a seed in the ground. We have to borrow a lot of money before we even plant,” Hemmes said.
Farmers have made it through the year relatively well, Hemmes added, mainly because most purchases for the harvest were made the previous year, before the trade tensions arose.
“We’re kind of holding our breath for this fall… that’s when it will hurt the most farmers,” Hemmes said.
 Bigger bills, tighter margins and loans farmers can’t repay

By late 2024, farmers were finding it much harder to borrow money. Bankers reported farms had less cash on hand and weren’t expecting enough income in 2025.
Chad Hart, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, said farmers are in a tough spot: high costs and low crop prices force them to take on more loans, but it’s getting harder to pay them back.
Farmers are applying for more loans than they did a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which tracks agricultural lending in Iowa, Michigan and most of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.
At the same time, the index of repayment rates for non-real-estate farm loans has declined year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, suggesting that many farmers are struggling to catch up, even as they take on more debt to stay afloat.
“Loan repayment has dropped,” Hart said. “A lot of this action is due to just the general decline in crop income over the past couple of years, which started before the trade fight.”
Meanwhile, agricultural loan interest rates have soared to historic highs, well above the levels farmers faced during Trump’s first trade war, making credit more expensive just when many need it most.
Part of the pressure stems from a political clash in Washington. Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, arguing that Americans need cheaper credit. He has even threatened to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
However, the central bank, designed to operate independently, has resisted political pressure.
Federal Reserve officials say they are weighing the inflationary risks of the tariffs and prefer to wait for more economic data before adjusting rates. They also worry that yielding to White House demands could damage the institution’s credibility.
Hart said the current downturn isn’t solely the result of tariffs, but rather the outcome of several compounding pressures. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb inflation, borrowing costs for farmers also rose. Combine those higher financing costs with falling commodity prices from oversupply, and now renewed tariff concerns, and “you get a recipe for a depressed market,” he said.
 A fragile truce on tariffs is likely temporary

After months of economic fallout, the U.S. and China reached a temporary truce that took effect June 11, cutting tariffs from record highs of 145% to 55% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. exports.
Although tensions with China have eased, tariffs on other major trading partners, announced in April, have only been paused until July 9. The truce is widely seen as fragile and temporary.
Hemmes said one of the consequences of the first trade war was that it opened the door for South American countries to enter the Chinese market, especially Brazil, which has become its leading soybean supplier.
Although the U.S. no longer sells the same volume of soybeans as before, “you cannot discard how much China buys,” even as the industry works to diversify its markets in other Asian countries, Hemmes said.
“We need trade with Mexico and Canada, too,” Hemmes added. “That’s why I think the reciprocal tariffs are going to hurt us more. We get fertilizer from Canada, ag chemicals from China, at least some of them. We get parts and products made in Mexico.”
As planting season got underway in April, many farmers were on edge about the ripple effects of U.S. trade policy. A majority of farmers said they expected current tariffs to hurt their bottom line this year, according to the Ag Economy Barometer from Purdue University and the CME Group, which surveyed 400 producers from April 14 to 21.
Farmers expressed particular concern about rising costs and limited availability of key supplies, especially fertilizer, crop chemicals and machinery parts.
However, while 44% said they anticipated a negative impact on farm income in 2025, and 53% feared continuing supply disruptions, 70% said they still believed that higher tariffs could ultimately strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy.
The same study, conducted a month later, also found that producers were more optimistic about both current conditions and future expectations.
“One of the drivers behind this month’s shift in farmer sentiment appeared to be a much more positive view of the U.S.’s long-run agricultural trade prospects,” the report said.
This shift in tone may reflect what Financial Times commentator Robert Armstrong calls TACO, short for Trump Always Chickens Out. The term describes a pattern in Trump’s trade policy: announcing sweeping tariffs that trigger economic shock, panic and stock market drops, only to reverse course later with pauses or reductions that help markets rebound.
“I think markets have become a bit skeptical about what’s actually going to happen,” Westhoff said. “So we saw in the case of the USMCA countries, Mexico and Canada, that, at least right now, tariffs don’t apply to them when it comes to agricultural products.”
He added that with those countries and the European Union — three of the most important trading partners for the U.S. farm sector — trade remains unchanged on the agricultural front.
However, Westhoff warned that the market reaction could be severe if the high tariffs move forward.
“If we get to July 9, or whatever the magic date ends up being, and we do indeed impose those very high tariffs and countries respond,” he said, “then we’re going to see a big market disruption.”

(Photo obtained by the Wisconsin Examiner)A Canadian mining company began work on an exploratory drilling project in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Taylor County earlier this month, triggering local concerns that the project could harm groundwater and the nearby north fork of the Yellow River as the company and state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) insist the permitting and regulatory processes are enough to keep the environment safe. 
Green Light Metals, which runs its U.S. operations out of Medford, owns the mineral rights to the Bend deposit in Taylor County, about 19 miles north of Medford, and the Reef deposit near Wausau. The Bend deposit, which has been explored before, contains copper, gold, silver and zinc. The deposit is estimated to contain more than 4 million tons of ore. If the drilling exploration is successful, it could lead to a larger underground mine. 
The start of work on the project is the beginning of the company’s efforts to expand its operations in the U.S. after it went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange earlier this year. 
“Wisconsin is open for business,” the company’s CEO Matt Filgate said on an investing focused podcast earlier this month. 
Company officials say their aim is to protect the environment while nodding to the possibility that a mine in the region could produce materials necessary for green infrastructure — mostly tellurium, a metal necessary in the construction of solar panels. 
“There are very detailed environmental review and environmental studies that are done on virtually every aspect of the surrounding environment,” Steven Donahue, a Green Light Metals board member, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in April. “An important component of that is the water resources, but it’s also all the ecosystems. It’s the engineering of the project, it’s how the project is going to be closed and reclaimed, and how it’s going to be able to protect the environment, not only during construction and operations, but also after it’s closed. All those facets of a project would be evaluated by the state.”
Views of the project within the rural, largely conservative county — President Donald Trump won Taylor County with 73.5% of the vote last year — vary widely. Much of the county is covered by the national forest, which Juliana Reimann, a Madison resident who grew up in the county and remains a regular visitor, says is a “magnificent, breathtaking natural environment.” 
Conservative hunters and fishers in the area are concerned about the drilling project’s potential effect on those activities in the forest or on the Yellow River. Still, some community members are hopeful the mine can bring some economic benefits to the community and others are keeping a watchful eye on the project without making a conclusion. 
“Some of the people who are in our group are adamantly opposed to any mine, period,” Cathy Mauer, a member of the Friends of the Yellow River, says. “Some of us think that so far they’re trying to be careful without being naive about it because the goal is to make money for their investors.” 
“I’ve found sometimes the people from Green Light are being, I don’t think they’re lying, I think they believe it, but I don’t think they’re being realistic about the potential problems,” she adds. “I think they’re being straightforward, they’re either optimistic or aren’t being completely realistic about the potential problems. And maybe we’re imagining the worst case scenario, which we need to. It’s the worst case scenarios that cause the problems. That’s what we have to plan for.”
Some environmental activists remain much more concerned about the possible effect of the drilling operation on the local water. 
“I really have such a love for that forest, and that drilling site is right smack dab in the middle of it,” Reimann says. “The project will impact groundwater, as I see it, heavily. And of course, groundwater is critical as drinking water.”
She adds that the health of the forest is important for the community’s ability to “thrive.” 
Wisconsin was under a mining moratorium from 1997 until 2017, which required companies that wanted to mine sulfide ores such as copper and gold to prove that other mines operated and were closed for 10 years without causing pollution. While business groups lauded the law’s repeal as opening up the state to billions of dollars in investment, drilling operations in the state have yet to result in a full mine being opened. 
With the repeal gone, the DNR’s permitting process for drilling operations requires companies to obtain a license and file a notice of intent to drill, which the state can deny, approve or approve with conditions. The company must then obtain a number of permits relating to stormwater discharge, dewatering operations, endangered species and wetland preservation. Because the site is within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service also has its own permitting process. 
The DNR’s approval of Green Light Metals’ notice of intent included nearly two dozen conditions but despite that, environmental activists remain concerned about a number of aspects of the project. 
When the company drills into the bedrock where the minerals are, the drill must go through the layers, known as the glacial overburden, above it, which requires a steel casing to keep chemicals out of the groundwater. The company obtains cuttings from the bedrock that can be tested for the metals it is looking for. After drilling is complete, the hole is filled from the bottom up with cement, which pushes up the lubricants and water used in the drilling process and flushes out the hole. 
State regulations require that the pipe used to pump in that cement be submerged the entire time so as to prevent air pockets forming. This is often done using what’s known as a tremie pipe, but Green Light Metals is instead pouring cement through the drill rods themselves, which come in 10 foot sections and therefore require that crews stop as each piece is removed — a method that activists are concerned makes the process more likely to cause pollution but DNR metallic mining coordinator Molly Gardner says is common practice. 
The materials flushed out of the drill hole as the cement rises are then put into a lined waste pit dug by the company, encased with more cement and finally covered with the topsoil. 
Activists are concerned the company will not be thorough enough to protect the environment throughout this process.
“It’s like any industrial activity, there is room for error, and if not fixed, you could have a problem,” Dave Blouin, the political chair for the Wisconsin Sierra Club, says. 
Additionally, there has been a dispute about the type of land the company is operating on. Green Light Metals says there is some wetland in the area, but not where it is drilling, while activists say much of the area is wetland, directly connecting the groundwater with the Yellow River. A recent study by the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey found that “the North Fork Yellow River and surrounding surface waters are connected to the shallow glacial aquifer.”
“The North Fork Yellow River is a river within the Chippewa Basin. Over 3,000 stream and river miles flow within the Chippewa River basin and with 156,200 acres of freshwater lakes, 22,711 acres of flowages and more than 150 acres of freshwater springs. The river basin watershed provides significant habitat, recreation, navigation and is a significant drinking water resource for northwest Wisconsin people,” Wisconsin Trout Unlimited said in a resolution opposing the Bend project. “Mining of metallic sulfide ores and minerals has a consistent proven record of surface and ground water contamination and pollution. This potential source of pollution threatens the groundwater of Taylor County and the surface waters of the Chippewa Basin watershed.”
When the company began digging the waste pit for its first drill hole last week, the crew hit water just four feet below ground, which opponents of the project say was the groundwater and proof the area is mostly wetland. 
State regulations require that waste pits for drilling “shall not be at or below the groundwater table at the time of the drilling activity and shall be constructed such that the base will remain above the normal local groundwater elevation.”
Reimann and other opponents believe the company moving forward puts the entire watershed at risk. 
“This drilling is taking place very close to the north fork of the Yellow River,” Reimann says. “It’s taking place in vast wetlands, the hydrology is such that any kind of contamination there will affect not only the Yellow River. The Yellow River flows to the Chequamegon Waters Flowage. People up there refer to it as Miller dam, that’s a very popular camping and fishing site, as well as close to the rice beds of the Ojibwe and ultimately those waters will migrate westward to the Chippewa River, to Lake Wissota and I guess ultimately to the Black River [and] to the Mississippi. You know that water doesn’t stay in one place, so it has a huge negative impact if those waters are contaminated.” 
But Gardner says those claims aren’t accurate and is confident in the department’s regulatory and inspection processes. She says the survey conducted by the company confirmed they weren’t drilling in wetlands and the water the crews found when digging the pit is just rainwater. She says the groundwater is actually 20 feet below the surface. 
The company’s wetland study was partially done as a “desk review” using maps, state data and satellite imagery. A field study by the company was conducted later, but “soils were not investigated,” and “WDNR Wetland Soils & Indicators (WSI) are prevalent across nearly the entire site,” a company memo states. 
“We’re looking at the access, we’re looking at the drilling operation, the sumps, the security, the safety, and everything that’s going on,” Gardner says. “We’re regulating, we’re inspecting that they follow their exploration plan.” 
She says that throughout the drilling process, which includes eight holes as part of the first phase and an additional 15 holes in the second phase, the DNR will have stormwater inspectors, exploration inspectors and Gardner herself on site at regular intervals and for occasional unannounced inspections. 
“It’s not common for the DNR to be able to go on site continuously with any type of construction projects,” Gardner says. “So mining and mining-related projects are allowed to have extra inspections to really ensure that things are going according to plan, because it is an important topic and it’s an important project, so we have more resources to do additional inspections for mining in relation to other types of construction projects.” 
Donahue, the company board member, says the company has been working with local officials and community members to keep them aware of what’s happening on the site and that the project will follow all “applicable regulations.” 
“The Green Light exploration team has been working diligently with the Wisconsin DNR and the U.S. Forest Service to secure all necessary permits and approvals for the exploration program,” he says. Green Light will work diligently to properly abandon the boreholes with the proper amount of cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permits.  In addition, the drill cuttings will be properly disposed by mixing the cuttings with cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permit requirements.”

(Getty Images)Fourth of July celebrations this week will come at a slightly higher cost than last year’s cookouts, according to the Indiana Farm Bureau. 
Feeding a group of ten will cost $71.49, or $7.15 per person — which is 5% more than what Hoosiers paid in 2024. Additionally, cookouts in Indiana will cost an estimated 6 cents more than the U.S. average, which sits at $7.09 per person. 
“Inflation is slowing slightly, prices are leveling out and supply chain issues that have been prevalent for the last few years are slowly getting worked out, so we are seeing just a slight increase in prices compared to the last few years here in Indiana,” said INFB Chief Economist Dr. Todd Davis in a release.
That $71.49 includes ground beef, cheese, hamburger buns, pork chops, chicken breasts, pork and beans, potato salad, strawberries, chips, ice cream, cookies and lemonade. 
Ice cream and strawberries saw the biggest increase between 2024 and 2025, growing by 31% and 19%, respectively — similar to the national cost increase. Hamburger buns and lemonade cost the average Hoosier roughly 8% less than their national peers.
  The Indiana Farm Bureau included the following items in their cookout baskets. (Graphic from the Indiana Farm Bureau)
Two main meat dishes are also slightly cheaper for Hoosiers this year: ground beef and pork chops. Ground beef fell from $13.88 for two pounds down to $13.81 while three pounds of pork chops will cost Hoosiers $14.57 this year — compared to $15.76 last year. 
“When you’re shopping, look for the bargains on the protein side,” said Davis. “According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there’s more pork in cold storage so the prices you’re seeing at the supermarket are generally going to be a bit lower. Ground beef, on the other hand, our shoppers found the price to be just about the same as last year, which is encouraging because cattle herd numbers remain low across the country.”
The federal agency estimates that 16 cents of every dollar spent on food goes back to farmers, with the rest paying for processing, packaging, distribution and food service preparation. 
“Farmers are price takers, not price makers – just like consumers,” said Janis Highley, an INFB vice president. “Margins are still tight for farmers due to high supply costs because the amount farmers are being paid isn’t covering that increase in expenses.
But Indiana farmers are committed to streamlining their operations to decrease costs of production as best they can, all while providing safe, affordable food not just for Hoosiers, but for families all over the world.”
Volunteer shoppers researched prices for their cookouts in early June throughout the state, collecting prices on the selected food items from their local grocery stores. They were directed to look for the best possible price without using a promotional coupon or purchase deal.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Covering Oklahoma’s Legislature for over a decade, it’s difficult not to feel cynical about the end of session and all the work left undone because they focused on inconsequential or unnecessary priorities.
So back in February before this year’s legislative session, I suggested several common-sense ideas that our lawmakers could adopt. These would actually make our state a better place with increased accountability for taxpayer spending, banning school personnel from beating disabled children and preventing adults from preying on children.
As that final gavel fell on May 30, signaling the end of the first session of the 60th Legislature, I decided to assess how many of those goals they had actually accomplished. Since lawmakers are obsessed with school performance, I decided to grade them on how well they did addressing those ideas.
Raising the age of consent:  A+  At long last, lawmakers decided to raise the age of sexual consent from 16 to 18, making Oklahoma one of about a dozen states that has adopted policies aimed at protecting children from predators. Oddly enough though, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt didn’t endorse the law by penning his name to the measure. Instead, it automatically  became law because he took no action. The measure seems to adequately protect teenagers who are having sexual relations with each other while protecting them for 50-year-old creeps trying taking advantage of them.
Banning corporal punishment in school on disabled children: A+  The measure prohibiting schools from administering physical discipline on children with federally protected disabilities limped its way across the finish line following yet another incredibly embarrassing public discussion that attempted to use the Bible to justify the practice. Yet when it arrived on Stitt’s desk, he also inexplicably refused to sign this one, allowing it instead to take effect without his signature. The practice has technically been banned by the state Department of Education since 2020, but lawmakers indicated that some districts are still spanking, choking and beating disabled children. Supporters argued that the ban needed to be codified into law.
Private school voucher-like tax credits: F  It was an embarrassing session for Republicans’ controversial private school tax credit program as Oklahomans got their first peek at who is benefiting. Lawmakers pitched the program as helping poorer students who need to escape struggling districts. But in what amounted to a surprise to nobody — except apparently naive Republican legislators — we learned that 92% of participants already had children in private schools and those from families making over $250,000 a year made up 1 in 4 participants. Thankfully Republicans wised up a bit and rebuffed calls from Stitt to eliminate the program’s $250 million spending cap all together. However, they still raised spending on the program by $50 million to top out the program’s spending at $250 million. Republicans also did not institute an income cap on who can participate, so taxpayers continue to subsidize the richest Oklahomans who least need financial support even while cutting funding to CareerTech.
Accountability for private schools accepting those tax credits: F Legislators still refuse to require private schools that accept state money to undergo the same rigorous testing and report cards that we require of our public schools, so how do we know we’re getting good bang for buck? As if that isn’t enough, lawmakers went a step further this year to muddy the accountability waters by cheerfully voting to hide the names of people accepting as much as $7,500 in state subsidies. The state Tax Commission had barely published a list of those who had received hundreds of millions in our tax dollars before lawmakers freaked out, insisting “family privacy” trumps fiscal transparency in Oklahoma. They conveniently ignored the fact that nobody is being forced to apply for these funds, this secrecy flies in the face of how we treat other tax credit program recipients, and taxpayers deserve to know who is accepting government handouts. Stitt happily inked his name on that bill. Why are lawmakers so terrified to prove that this is money well spent?
Incentivizing good, experienced teachers to want to work in Oklahoma classrooms:  C  Much to the disappointment of early- and mid-career educators, lawmakers did not boost the salaries of all classroom teachers. They did extend the salary schedule to 35 years, meaning a teacher with 35 years experience can now make no less than $60,973 a year. Previously, the salary schedule capped out at 25 years or a minimum of $56,049. Lawmakers also opened Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship program, which pays resident tuition at a public college, to classroom teachers with at least a decade of experience. Lawmakers again did nothing to boost support staff pay.
Early voting access: F We have the worst voter turnout rates in the country, and will continue to do so after lawmakers conveniently “forgot” the fact that their constituents waited for hours in line during the last election to vote. Going into session, there was bipartisan enthusiasm surrounding the idea of expanding the early voting window to increase access. But those went nowhere this year. Now a little more than a year out from the state’s major election cycle, in which we’ll elect a new governor and new legislative members, Republicans have shown they’re perfectly happy with low turnout.
If you’re keeping track, that brings the Oklahoma Legislature to about a C average grade for the session. Here’s hoping they can bring up their GPA and our state’s overall quality of life next year. 
I’ll have my grading pen ready.

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo courtesy of Jay and Chyenne Smith)EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the fourth installment of Howl, a five-part written series and podcast season produced in partnership between the Idaho Capital Sun, States Newsroom and Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho rancher Jay Smith has a wolf problem.
Over the last 20 years, Smith said wolves have killed more than 200 of his cattle and caused major financial harm to his family’s business.
﻿
“At today’s value at nearly $2,000 a head, times that by 200 and see if we could have invested that money over time what would that have been?” Smith said. “Significant.”
Smith and his wife, Chyenne, raise Black Angus cattle near the town of Carmen, a tiny community near the Continental Divide, just west of the Montana border.
Jay grew up nearby; his family has been ranching in the area since 1924.
Last year, the family celebrated its centennial on the land.
But their history goes back even longer.
Smith has a family history book documenting cattle ownership back to the 1600s.
“So my family’s cattle raising lineage goes way back,” Smith said.
There’s something else that goes way back in Smith’s family: Warnings about wolves that have been passed down through the generations.
 Idaho rancher ‘got to be a cowboy every day’ of his life

The J Lazy S Angus Ranch is situated in a green valley set in the shadows of high mountain peaks, some of which rise above 10,000 feet.
Wildfire smoke often hangs in the air during the summer. And on the other side of the valley, the Salmon River cuts through the landscape.
  Jay Smith, owner of J Lazy S Angus Ranch in Carmen, Idaho, is a fourth-generation rancher who lives in what he calls “wolf ground zero.” (Photo courtesy of Jay and Chyenne Smith)
The ranch features a classic red barn, a horse corral, an assortment of farm machinery and a renovated old cabin surrounded by shade trees.
They have a small herd of Morgan-Quarter Horse crossbreeds and an array of cattle dogs that go everywhere with the Smiths, including high up in the surrounding mountains.
“One of the main reasons Chyenne and I bought this place is A, because ranching is in my blood,” Smith said. “But B, it’s exactly how we wanted to raise our children. I wanted them to have the work ethic and the animal husbandry background that I grew up with. I think it’s very important.”
Running cattle and working the ranch is all he’s ever known, and Smith wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“I don’t know if you ever watch TV, but I got to be a cowboy every day of my life, so I don’t know how you go wrong there,” Smith said. “(There is) a lot of freedom. These ranches are big, and so we had a lot of private property where us kids could go a long ways without getting in trouble or being in the wrong spot. And I don’t know how a city kid could ever get their head around that, but we could literally go for miles and not be somewhere we shouldn’t be.”
 Ranching and living in wolf ground zero

The Smiths’ several hundred cattle have a lot of room to roam, too.
During summers, the cows live in the high country. They spend 12 to 16 weeks each in a cow camp way up in the mountains, roaming far and wide on public land.
And that’s where they run into trouble with wolves.
Only a few ridgelines separate Smith’s ranch from wolf ground zero: one of the original sites of reintroduction 30 years ago – Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.

“It’s been one of the most consistently conflicted allotments throughout the years,” Smith said.
Jay Smith was 22 years old in 1995 when the government reintroduced wolves. He has seen ranching before wolves were reintroduced and the difference the animals made after they were reintroduced.
“We worked really hard to keep (reintroduction) from happening,” Smith said. “And then when it became inevitable and we could see the writing on the wall, then we started trying to position ourselves for how to live with the inevitable. It was coming. We’ve been here 100 years. We’re not leaving. So now how do we make this work?”
 Idaho rancher affected by wolf depredation says compensation hard to come by

Not only do the wolves literally eat into their business, but every time the Smiths or other ranchers speak out or try to do something about it, they say they are vilified.
“The negativity and the hate towards ranchers is worse than the wolves, in my opinion, and it’s because the public’s been fed this fairy tale of what wolves are,” Chyenne Smith said. “And we’re the bad guys in every one of those stories.”
Jay Smith said he hasn’t seen a nickel in compensation for the livestock wolves killed.
“We have been paid for zero head ever,” he said.
Although Smith said he hasn’t been paid for any of his livestock losses, other Idaho ranchers have.

The state of Idaho has a compensation program to reimburse livestock owners the fair market value of animals that are killed by wolves or grizzly bears.
It applies to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, llamas and even bees – basically any animal used for food or in food production.
From 2014 to 2022, the state of Idaho’s livestock compensation program paid out $687,029.50 to 299 different livestock producers for compensation for verified livestock losses, state records show.
But to be paid, livestock owners must have a confirmed wolf kill claim filed with the Office of Species Conservation each year.
“In the topography we run in, we can’t find them in time,” Smith said. “They just simply don’t come home. We’ll find a pile of bones. We’ll find wolf scat right on top of those bones. I mean, we know what happened to them. But as far as Wildlife Services coming in and being able to make a confirmation report to send to the Office of Species Conservation to put us in the reimbursement program, we are zero for 200. That’s our batting average.”
State records show that most investigations of wolf complaints don’t conclude that wolves were definitely responsible.
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, Idaho Wildlife Services investigated 99 complaints of livestock losses blamed on wolves, state records show. About 28% of those investigations ruled wolves’ responsibility for livestock deaths were “confirmed” or “probable.”
But more than two-thirds of the wolf complaints, about 68%, were classified as “possible/unknown.” In some cases, wolves may have eaten the carcass of livestock after the animal was already dead but did kill the animal.
Smith said his losses add up.
“We have lost over 200 head of livestock in that 20-plus years to wolves,” Jay Smith said.
“One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero,” he added. “And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk. It’s very variable, and it’s very unknown. But it’s remained over the years. It hasn’t gone away. It sounds like it’s come and gone, but the wolves are still back there.”
And even if wolves don’t kill livestock like cows and sheep, even the presence of wolves can distress animals enough that they aren’t as healthy and wouldn’t be worth as much at market.
But wolf supporters say the number of livestock killed is extremely low. In Idaho, Montana and Wyoming wolves are confirmed to have killed an average of less than 300 domestic animals per year – out of 6 million cows and sheep in those states.
But even if the overall numbers and percentages are low, the cost is high for the farming and ranching families like the Smiths.
With 30 years of experience since reintroduction and all the claims made by wolf advocates and all the meetings with the feds, nothing has changed Smith’s mind about wolves.
He opposed reintroducing wolves, and now that they are here, Smith thinks there are too many of them. As a result, he thinks ranchers should be given broad authority to kill wolves to protect their livestock.
And as the chairman of his local county’s Republican Party central committee, Smith has helped make that happen. He said he co-wrote a 2021 state law that helped make it easier to kill more wolves by expanding when and how they can be hunted and trapped.
The law allows hunters to purchase an unlimited number of wolf tags to kill wolves and makes trapping on private land legal year round.
“There’s still people vehemently against every proposal we have,” Smith said. “And I don’t know why. We’re not out to kill them all. We’re just out to make a living and keep our livelihoods.”
Chyenne Smith agreed.
“It’s about not being able to do everything we can to protect what’s ours when we need to,” she said.
 The role trapping plays in the wolf v. livestock debate

When there are problems with wolves harassing or killing livestock, ranchers often call on trappers to catch the predators.
And one of the best people at trapping wolves is Rusty Kramer.

He’s the president of the Idaho Trappers Association and the incoming president of the National Trappers Association.

Whether it’s badgers, beavers, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, muskrats or wolves, if it’s legal to trap in Idaho, Kramer has probably caught it.
Depending on the animals, he’s used scent lures, bait or even blind set traps, hoping to entice an animal to step on a silver dollar-sized pan, which triggers the trap’s jaws to lose around the wolf’s foot and seize hold.
Once a wolf is trapped, Kramer shoots it behind the shoulder with his .22 magnum pistol, killing it. Since wolves were reintroduced, he’s trapped and killed 25 to 30.
Kramer was born and raised in Fairfield, Idaho, near the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho.
“I just learned how to trap looking over my dad’s shoulder and riding around with him and just kind of fell in love with it as a kid and I’ve been doing it ever since,” Kramer said.
It started as damage control, trapping ground squirrels and marmots, also known as rock chucks, to protect the alfalfa. Later, he moved on to coyotes and muskrats.
Kramer’s father taught him how to process and sell the pelts, stressing the importance of using every part of the animal. As a kid, the pelts put a little extra money in his pocket.
For him, trapping is a way of life and a family tradition.
Today, Kramer said the Idaho Trappers Association runs the largest fur sale in the United States, in Glenns Ferry, where a trapper can make good money for a wolf pelt.
A quality wolf pelt can go for $500 or more.
For 10 years as an adult, Kramer lived in Boise – the state’s largest city – about a 90-minute drive from Fairfield. After Micron Technology laid him off, Kramer returned to Fairfield.
But it’s tough to make a living on trapping alone, and Kramer also runs an alfalfa farm and is the watermaster for his local water district.
It’s the farm where Kramer and other farmers run into trouble with wolves. Ever since wolves came back, Kramer says, a lot more elk are hanging out in the valley where he and many other farmers grow alfalfa. He says the elk hang out there to keep safe from wolves, who tend to avoid agricultural areas because of the human presence. The elk trample the fields and eat the alfalfa, creating a headache and a cost for Rusty.
“I don’t hate wolves,” Kramer said. “I very (much) admire wolves. How far they can roam and how cunning they are and survive out there.”
But he thinks it was a mistake to reintroduce wolves to Idaho.
“I’m under the opinion it would be cool to snap your fingers and it’s back to ‘Dances with Wolves’ days,” Kramer said, referring to the 1990 movie starring Kevin Costner. “You know, where it’s buffalo from Ohio to Oregon and grizzlies and wolves. But there’s only so many places that grizzlies, wolves and buffalo can have in the 21st century, because they just roam so far. These aren’t foxes and coyotes that can live around humans.”
“There’s just not enough space for them in the 21st century, in my opinion,” Kramer said.
 Does Idaho’s Wood River Wolf Project offer a solution to protecting livestock from wolves?

Suzanne Asha Stone is trying to to demonstrate that ranchers can live side-by-side with wolves today.
Thirty years ago, Stone was an intern working on the wolf reintroduction project. Since then, she’s become a prominent wolf expert and advocate.
She is the executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho.

Lately, Stone has been focusing on helping ranchers protect sheep and cattle without killing wolves.
Stone said the catalyst for the work was a “train wreck” of conflict between wolves and sheep in 2007 in central Idaho’s Blaine County.
Unaware that wolves were denning with pups in the area, a rancher let out his flock of sheep with some livestock guardian dogs for protection, Stone said.
“So to wolves, having those dogs come in meant that they had strange wolves coming in and were a significant threat to their pups,” Stone said. “The rancher, of course, didn’t know this. He had no idea that the wolves were there. But within 24 hours, we had dead sheep, dead livestock guardian dogs and a (wolf) pack with a death warrant on their head.”
Stone said the community came together after the event to look for a way to project sheep and wolves.
“It was at that time that the residents of Blaine County pushed back hard and said, ‘We really enjoy having wolves here. We had our own little Yellowstone happening right in our backyard, where we could go out and watch these wolves and their pups, and we want to keep them alive,’” Stone said.
From there, Stone sat down at the table with ranchers in the area, as well as an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services.
Stone said just about everyone was skeptical, even wolf biologists who wanted to keep more wolves alive.
“And so we sat down with all of them and then reached out to the ranchers and just said, ‘Let us try these nonlethal tools. Now everybody’s telling us we’re going to fail, but let’s try and see what happens,’” Stone said.
Stone started using something called fladry.
It’s nothing more than a barrier of waving flags, but it has proven successful to deter wolves in Eastern Europe and help sell high-mileage Hondas stateside.
“It looks like the flagging that sits around used car lots, basically,” Stone said. “It doesn’t look intimidating to us at all. Wolves don’t like it. They don’t trust it. And so we were able to keep the sheep behind those fladry pens for the rest of the season without having a single other loss. And the wolves were right there raising their pups for a good part of that summer. No more incidents at all.”
Stone’s critics called it beginner’s luck and questioned whether she could replicate her results over long periods of time or large areas.
That led to the creation of the Wood River Wolf Project, which for the last 17 summers has been partnering with ranchers in the area to use non-lethal tools and techniques to protect sheep from wolves.
The project area covers about 4,600 square miles of rugged, mountainous terrain.
Stone says there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to wolf conflicts – different terrain, different predator behavior, even varying access to electricity can affect what works. So, she’ll try just about anything – and her group has over the years. They’ve used solar-powered strobe lights, blasted air horns, played recordings of helicopters, even had cowboys play music.
In one case, wolves were feasting on llamas at an eastern Oregon ranch. So Stone’s team set up those 20-foot air dancers you see at car lots and lit them up at night.
“So when the wolves came over the top of the hill, they saw this enormous monster up there flapping around and making all kinds of noise, and oh my gosh, they were in the next county the next day,” she said.
“We’ve only lost two wolves in the 17 years now of the project and an average of less than five sheep a year for that entire 17-year period,” Stone said. “So it’s the lowest loss of livestock to wolves in any area where wolves and livestock overlap in the Western United States, probably beyond that. It’s a very successful project, and we use less money than what they do to kill wolves outside of the project area, where they’re losing more livestock there.”
But Stone hasn’t convinced everyone. In fact, one key holdout is her own state government.
Even when nonlethal methods of wolf control are available, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s written policy preference is to kill wolves to reduce the overall wolf population in the state.
“A lot of what we’ve learned here is being applied in countries all over the world, just not in the state of Idaho, and not to any real extent beyond our project area, because the state is so determined to kill wolves rather than to live with them,” Stone said.

New rules allow members of the public and state employees to go armed in government buildings, with exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities. 
The post Concealed carry allowed in many Wyoming state government buildings starting Tuesday appeared first on WyoFile .","Starting Tuesday, Wyomingites will be allowed to carry guns into state government buildings, with some exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities.
On June 17, the Wyoming State Building Commission — composed of the governor, treasurer, state auditor, secretary of state and superintendent of public education — adopted rules allowing concealed carry in most state government buildings in preparation for a new law that takes effect Tuesday repealing “gun-free” zones in government buildings.
The new rules mark a major expansion of where citizens can carry firearms as they conduct business with their government. That expansion comes at the behest of the Legislature and over the objections of Gov. Mark Gordon, who sought to implement concealed carry into Wyoming’s state buildings through a rule-making process overseen by the building commission. But lawmakers passed their repeal bill with a veto-proof majority this year. Gordon nixed a previous version in 2024.
The Legislature’s drive to open state government buildings to armed citizens coincides with concerns about increased political violence in America. Earlier this month, a man assassinated a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and nearly killed another lawmaker and his partner. That violence came on the heels of an arson attack on Pennsylvania’s governor, and months after a campaign season in which two people tried to assassinate President Donald Trump. 
Lawmakers who pushed for the concealed carry bill, which passed the Senate with a 25-6 vote and the House with a 50-10 vote, believe allowing citizens to go armed and defend themselves is the antidote to such violence. Opponents fear more guns in more places will lead to more deaths and injuries, both accidental and deliberate.
This winter, public areas of the Wyoming State Capitol were opened to concealed carry. You do not need a permit to concealed carry a lawfully purchased firearm in the Equality State.
Separately, the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information issued a new policy allowing state employees to concealed carry but required them to store firearms in a locked box when it is not on their person.

That policy does not require employees to have taken gun safety or active shooter courses, though it says they are “strongly encouraged” to do so. 
Exceptions to the new rules include the Wyoming Judiciary, where bailiffs go armed but members of the public are forbidden to carry weapons into courtrooms. The public is also not allowed to carry firearms into facilities primarily used by law enforcement, including jails, prisons and agency offices like those of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation. 
Concealed carry will also remain prohibited in treatment facilities operated by the health department and field offices of the Wyoming Department of Family Services. Those exceptions were all included in the Legislature’s repeal bill. 
Around the state, Wyoming school boards have struggled to write new policies to conform with the law, which also forced the allowance of concealed carry in public schools. That response on a local level has highlighted the political differences between counties, WyoFile reported in collaboration with news outlets around the state.
The process for state government has been more subdued. The State Building Commission’s emergency meeting to adopt the new rules featured only one public commenter, who brought to officials a concern about a piece of wording in the law he thought violated legislative intent. The Wyoming Public Employee Association, which represents state workers across different agencies, didn’t take a position, Executive Director Betty Jo Beardsley told WyoFile.
Her members fall on both sides of the debate about whether gun-free zones are safer or targets for people who want to do harm, she said.
The emergency rules may only last until July 9, Wyoming State Building Commission Secretary Suzanne Nelson told WyoFile in an interview Wednesday. On that day, the five elected officials are scheduled to meet again and are likely to adopt permanent rules that echo the emergency rules going into effect Tuesday. 
Though lawmakers had given the executive branch 30 days to implement rules after the law went into effect, Nelson said officials wanted to have rules in place when the law took effect.  
Posted signs of a “no” symbol over the silhouette of a handgun will indicate those buildings or spaces within buildings where concealed carry is prohibited, Nelson said.

The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation, argues Pete Gosar.
The post Rural health clinics like mine will bear the burden of Congress’s Medicaid cuts appeared first on WyoFile .","The “$1.5 trillion in tax cuts” that Congress’s “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to extend is not merely a fiscal policy; it is a profound sacrifice. 

Opinion

This sacrifice will not be borne by those who stand to gain, but by the very fabric of our society: our key social programs like Medicaid and SNAP benefits. The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation. As the director of a free primary care facility, I am dismayed by the callous lack of compassion Congress is demonstrating for financially strapped Americans.
The burden of care, inevitably, will fall upon the shoulders of free clinics like the Downtown Clinic in Laramie, where I have worked for over a decade. For the low-income, uninsured individuals we serve — those without Medicare, Medicaid, or VA benefits — the emergency room is often their only other recourse. We strive to provide high-quality, integrated healthcare, but when the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would remove 10.9 million people from Medicaid and 5.1 million from the Affordable Care Act, it forces a chilling question: Where will these 16 million vulnerable Americans go?
In America today, 2 million people already receive essential care through free clinics like ours. Last year alone, the Free Clinic Association reported 6 million patient visits. We are proud to do this vital work, and 90% of our funding is derived from privately raised dollars. But how, I ask, do you expect an additional 12 to 16 million people to enter this system without a shred of additional financial support? This puts clinics like ours in an utterly precarious situation. It is, as I see it, nothing less than a cost shift from the federal government, designed solely to funnel tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. That is not the America I believe in.
The damage extends catastrophically to rural healthcare. It’s estimated that this bill will lead to over $50 billion in lost Medicaid reimbursements over the next 10 years. The proposed $15 billion rural healthcare fund is, quite frankly, a disingenuous band-aid — an admission by our representatives in Congress that they recognize the harm this bill will inflict upon rural communities. This meager fund doesn’t begin to cover the projected losses, nor will it prevent the eventual shutdown of vital rural hospitals. If Congress truly wished to support rural healthcare, they would ensure people have access to healthcare in the first place, rather than offering inadequate props after inflicting such profound damage.
The America I was raised to believe in is one that values communities and supports neighbors. Growing up in Wyoming, at an elevation of 7,000 feet, if you saw a car on the side of the road in the winter, it could literally be a life-or-death situation. You didn’t hesitate; you pulled over, checked on them, offered help, a tow, or a ride to town. You checked in on your neighbors, feeding their animals when they were away. The values of looking out for each other, of community responsibility, are core to Americans, especially in rural communities. We must continue to embody that spirit.
This bill does not. There is a direct, undeniable line from the cuts in Medicaid and SNAP benefits to the enrichment of the richest few. Is this truly what Congress desires for our nation? I believe the American public does not want more income inequality. They want a country where we care for our neighbors, where a social safety net supports those in need, and where healthcare is a right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy. 
It’s time for Congress to listen to the American people and reconsider a bill that fundamentally betrays our shared values.

(Photo by Clare Fieseler/ Canary Media)Gary Yerman, 75, sat nervously in a noisy ballroom in Virginia Beach, Virginia, counting down the minutes until he could shed his ill-fitting double-breasted suit for a sun shirt and blue jeans. He introduced himself as a fisherman of 50 years to a stranger seated next to him at the banquet table.
“That sounds really hard,” the other man replied. 
“Not as hard as it’s going to be to go accept this award and talk to a room full of people,” joked Yerman. Moments later, his name was called, and he walked onto a professionally lit stage to accept a small crystal trophy from the Oceantic Network, a leading trade group for the burgeoning multibillion-dollar U.S. offshore wind industry.
It was an unlikely sight. America’s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies. 
The conflict started in the early 2000s, when the first plans for New England’s offshore wind areas were sketched out. In packed town hall meetings that often devolved into shouting matches, fishermen claimed the projects would make it harder to earn a living: fewer fishing grounds, fewer fish, damaged ocean habitat. 
Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50 offshore wind farms in its waters. Wind areas there are thriving with sharks and serving as a surprising habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.
Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100 fishermen and fisherwomen who go by the name Sea Services North America. They’ve decided to work for offshore wind farms — not against them. Doing so supplements their income from scalloping, a centuries-old bedrock of the New England fishing economy that has seen revenues dry up. 
Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.
“They called us traitors,” he said.  
Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “garbage” and “bullshit” and, in the weeks leading up to his inauguration, pledged that​ “no new windmills” would be built in the U.S. during his presidency. He’s backed up those words with action since taking office, stopping new projects from proceeding and attempting to block some of the country’s eight fully permitted offshore wind projects, too. 
Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down. 
Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishermen.
One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “big time.”
“Everyone was skeptical”
Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. 
Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant. 
Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.

Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — that Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win. 
“Everyone knows that fishermen hate offshore wind companies. Well, guess what? Offshore wind companies hate fishermen, too,” Morrissey, who no longer works at Ørsted, told Canary Media earlier this year. “Our goal here is to spread the understanding that these two industries can and do and will work together.”
The idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990s, scallop numbers remain unpredictable. In his view, if offshore wind companies were moving into their waters — like it or not — they might as well make some money from it. 
Yerman got to work. 
His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.  
When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2020 landed their first small contract, with Ørsted. It was a pilot, said Morrissey, to see if this arrangement would work here in America. 
“Everyone was skeptical,” recalled Morrissey with a laugh. “Because their boats were in such poor safety condition. But you know what? They pulled it off.” 
Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22 fishing boats up to certified safety standards. With Videll at the helm as part-time CEO, the group has completed over 11 contracts in eight different wind farm areas, from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Instead of hiring ferries or work boats, developers rely on Sea Services fishermen to provide safety and scout services for offshore wind vessels. 
It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey. 
Sea Services was an “indispensable partner” in helping to build South Fork Wind, which went online last year and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.
Cooperation between these two sides — offshore wind and commercial fishing — does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the codevelopers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out $8 million directly to local fishermen unaffiliated with Sea Services for similar safety jobs over the past two years.
But Sea Services is unique. Today the group offers an expansive network of 22 partner vessels based in six states and is led by a commercial fisherman. Videll brought on new technology, allowing developers to track their work in real time. He said they adopted a co-op model to maximize the amount of money going into participants’ pockets. 
Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome. 
Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that has since been called off in part due to roadblocks created by the administration. 
The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1, two weeks after the project had begun at-sea construction.
It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO, said at the time that the cessation of Empire Wind would be a crushing blow that could cost the co-op a total of $9 million to $12 million worth of work. 
In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration. 
Taking a risk
On a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 57-year-old Souza hovered over a checklist and laptop in the captain’s quarters of the Pamela Ann. Souza is the captain of the boat, and he needed to make sure everything was in order before he and his crew left New Bedford that afternoon. They’d be at sea for 10 days, working in many of the spots Souza had fished in for decades. 
Those 10 days at sea would not be spent dredging up scallops from the seafloor and tallying their catch, however, but conducting safety operations for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
The hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey. In the galley, Souza’s 25-year-old son, one of the three mates onboard, sorted through the food they’d need. Jack Morris, a 73-year-old scalloper and Sea Services manager, paced around the Pamela Ann checking in on its recently updated safety assets, like a new tracking beacon and safety suits. 
Trips like these have become a lifeline for Souza, his crew, and an increasing number of fishermen who depend on the struggling scalloping industry. 
Today, there are roughly 350 vessels sitting in ports from Maine to North Carolina that have licenses to harvest sea scallops. For several decades, East Coast scallopers managed to eke out a comfortable middle-class lifestyle on scalloping alone. Morris said that “years ago” he’d pull in $200,000 to $300,000 of profit annually as a scallop boat captain.
“Yeah, those days are gone,” scoffed Morris. 
While the price of scallops remains high, making it one of the most lucrative U.S. fisheries, rules passed over the last 30 years have restricted when and where scallopers can harvest, resulting in fewer days at sea, fewer scallops caught — and less money for the entire industry.

Souza has mixed emotions about the regulations.
On the one hand, scallops are no longer being overfished. A 2024 third-party audit of the fishery said it “meets the requirements for a well-managed and sustainable fishery.” In fact, for over a decade, U.S. sea scallops sold on grocery store shelves have carried a little blue-check label — the mark of a seafood certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
But most scallop fishermen are now limited to an extremely short window of time during which they can harvest scallops— in 2025, it was just 24 days. Some of their favorite fishing grounds are regularly closed for scallop recovery. There are simply fewer scallops to go around. Souza estimates that captains who stick to scalloping alone are making half of what they did in years past: “They’re probably lucky to make a hundred [thousand].”
Offshore wind work has helped fishermen like Souza and Morris ease the sting of that lost income. 
Across Revolution Wind’s two-year construction window, Souza expects to make over $200,000 as a part-time boat captain. For the younger generation, who Souza said as deckhands can expect to make only around $30,000 per year from scalloping, offshore wind work makes it possible to keep earning a middle-class wage. 
In the past year, Souza has recruited to Sea Services both of his sons, his nephew, and a few other young folks from longtime fishing families who might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income.
“This wind farm business is the number one way for scallop guys, captains, mates, deckhands, to make extra money,” said Morris.
It’s also helping to revitalize the port of New Bedford, a city of 100,000 that is not only the most valuable fishing port in America but also a place of tremendous historic importance to the industry. It was once the epicenter of the whaling world and serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.” 
In just 10 years, the offshore wind industry has ushered in a transformation the city hadn’t seen “since the whaling era,” according to Jon Mitchell, the city’s mayor since 2011. 
The companies building Vineyard Wind now stage their offshore wind infrastructure in New Bedford. Their presence has brought a flood of public and private funding to the city, with over $1.2 billion already invested and pledged to help give the terminals, docks, and harbor a facelift, according to Mitchell.

For all the money offshore wind has brought to the city — and into the pockets of locals like Souza and Morris — offshore wind remains highly controversial among many commercial fishermen in New Bedford. 
That’s in spite of Mitchell’s insistence that, when push comes to shove, New Bedford’s local government will always side with scalloping. 
Still, Mitchell, one of New England’s fiercest offshore wind defenders, remains unpopular with many down at the boat docks. “I’ve put myself in the loneliest place in American politics, which is right in the middle. Between offshore wind and commercial fishing,” he said. 
Trump flags, full pockets
The fishermen who take part in Sea Services also float in that lonely place. 
It’s not uncommon for them to face harassment from other fishermen over the radio when out on the water, Yerman said. One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge. 
The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.  
“You’ll have the lobster guys and they’ll say shit to you — like, ‘traitor.’ Or ‘Trump’s gonna shut that down, ha ha ha,’” Souza said, imitating the taunts he receives over the marine radio bolted to the wall near the helm of the Pamela Ann. 
The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members — including Souza — voted for.

As Souza prepared to leave the New Bedford port in February to go help Ørsted build giant wind turbines in the ocean, something Trump swore would not happen during his term, he explained his support for the president.
“Trust me, I want Trump to ‘drill, drill, drill.’ I’m all for it,” said Souza of the president’s plans to expand oil and gas production. 
But he still thinks offshore wind is necessary to get more power onto New England’s grid and lower energy costs. Experts say that the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long — about four years. But, in the Northeast region, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.  
“Once we ‘drill, drill, drill,’ you’re still gonna need more electricity,” Souza said. “Where are you gonna get it? My electric bill at my house is stupid high!”
Most of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, he insisted. Morris, who also voted for Trump, agreed. Overall, Trump won 46% of the city’s votes in last November’s election — a much higher proportion than his Massachusetts statewide total of 36.5%. The “TRUMP 2024” flags flown from the dozens of scallop boats docked across New Bedford’s port underscored the point. A few of those Trump flag-flying boats even work for the offshore wind companies, Morris claims. The Pamela Ann, for its part, does not have a Trump flag. 
“I support Trump even though I know he’s against wind. … I believe this will still be around,” said Souza, gesturing toward the ocean, where somewhere over the horizon an array of wind towers was being erected. “He’s gonna see the light.” 
Trump, of course, has not seen the light — though he did revoke his stop-work order against Empire Wind. 
After being grounded for a month, Sea Services fishermen began operations on Empire Wind again in early June, when the project resumed at-sea work. The co-op’s members are helping Equinor’s construction vessels lay boulders on the seafloor to stabilize all 54 wind towers that will be raised over the next two years and eventually supply much-needed carbon-free power to New York City. 
But nothing is certain. When the Trump administration unpaused the project, it left open the door to stopping it again — or killing it altogether. A May letter from the Interior Department to Equinor noted that it is still conducting an “ongoing review” to determine if the project’s permits were “rushed” and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of the Trump administration. 
Meanwhile, a coalition of a dozen fishing companies and several anti-offshore wind groups typically allied with Trump sued the administration on June 3, just days before Empire Wind restarted at-sea construction, in an attempt to reinstate the stop-work order. The move came weeks after wind opponents asked Trump to also pause Revolution Wind, one of the more lucrative contracts Sea Services holds.
In his opposition to offshore wind, Trump has positioned himself as a defender of the commercial fishing industry, claiming falsely at a May 2024 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, for example, that the turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.”  
But for the increasing number of fishermen working with offshore wind companies, halting the industry would not help — it would crush a financial lifeline.
Not long ago, in 2017, Sea Services captain Rodney Avila remembers being one of the only fishers in New Bedford willing to seize this lifeline. He recalled with a laugh what a long-time fisherman friend said to him then: “When you put that first wind turbine up there … we’re going to hang you from it!”
Times have changed. In the New Bedford area, almost 50 local fishing vessels have performed some kind of safety or scouting work for Vineyard Wind. At least one captain lowers his MAGA-supporting flag before setting out to work on the projects the president has sworn to stop, according to Avila. He said politics has always been tangled up in fishing. And work is work. 
“They don’t care whether it’s red, or blue, or whatever color. … They don’t care,” Avila shrugged, while sipping coffee inside a Dunkin’. Five scalloping boats bobbed on calm water just beyond the parking lot. “It’s money that they need to support their families, wherever it comes from.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3738-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Bill Lee signs his signature private school voucher law. (Photo: John Partipilo/ Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee House Republican says the legislature should require the Department of Education to provide more information about private-school voucher applicants for a thorough evaluation of the new program.
Parents applying for the money don’t have to disclose where their children attended school previously, and the state is refusing to provide that information or even the counties where students live. 
Additionally, applications for “universal” vouchers, those without an income cap, don’t require parents to list financial information.
Lawmakers who opposed the program are raising questions about what they perceive as critical information as the state offers nearly $7,300 each to 20,000 students to enroll in private schools, at a total cost of $146 million. Half the recipients, 10,000, have financial limits at 300% of the federal poverty level, an estimated $175,000 for a family of four, while the families of the remainder face no income restrictions.
  “It seems fairly clear that the (Lee) administration does not want to know these things,” said Rep. Jody Barrett, R-Dickson, of a lack of information released on private school voucher applicants. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“It seems fairly clear that the administration does not want to know these things because they’re afraid it may not line up with the narrative that was put out there for the reason they were supporting this measure,” Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson told the Lookout.
Numerous lawmakers said during debate they supported the private-school vouchers to help struggling parents send their children to better schools.
Chalkbeat initially reported on the matter and found two-thirds or more of the students in Alabama and Florida who received voucher funds already attended private schools.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is among the lawmakers trying to obtain what he called “basic” information about the voucher program to make sure it complies with the law.
“They’re giving out checks like Cash for Clunkers,” Hemmer said, comparing it to a 2009 federal rebate program designed to bolster the economy and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.  
Lawmakers narrowly passed Gov. Bill Lee’s main initiative this year even though the state’s own financial impact analysis showed 65% of the students who receive the vouchers would be enrolled in private schools already. Students from private schools surrounded the governor when he signed the bill into law at the State Capitol.
Barrett, who voted against the measure this year, said he requested information about students’ previous enrollment and home counties after the Education Department’s first release showed only ZIP codes. Barrett added that he asked the department to provide the home counties for applicants so lawmakers could assess the demand and tailor the program to serve students.
In contrast, the state’s Education Savings Account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga requires parents to provide financial information.
“This department just seems like they’re intent on intentionally not understanding those things. Or they’re not disclosing that information,” Barrett said.
Tennessee legislature puts hundreds of millions toward private-school vouchers

The second-term lawmaker said the legislature should form a board to oversee the program or request a study by a group such as the Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations to allow legislators to see if they’re getting a “bang for their buck.”
State Rep. Mark White, chairman of the House Education Administration Committee, told the Lookout he needs to ask the department why it’s not asking for financial information on “universal” scholarships, because it is required by the bill.
The governor’s office said the law doesn’t require the state to collect information on previous enrollment, Chalkbeat reported.
White said he spoke with officials at one private school in Memphis who told him 80% of those receiving the funds were enrolled there already.
Yet he defended the program, saying it can benefit middle-class families whose children attend private schools in Memphis with tuition costs in the $15,000 range.
The Department of Education sent out a release in late May saying it received 38,000 applications for the voucher program, about half coming from families who qualify based on their income. 
The Education Department did not respond to questions from the Lookout about the program. Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds has not taken questions from the media in more than a year but said in the May release that demand is strong for “universal school choice.”
“All students deserve the ability to access a learning environment that best fits their unique needs,” Reynolds said in the release.
Besides the cost of the vouchers, this year’s bill contained a provision requiring local school boards to approve one-time $2,000 bonuses for teachers at a total cost of $198 million. The state is spending another $2.6 million to hire 11 people to oversee the program and $625,000 to contract with Student First Technologies to handle the online financial portion of the program.

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The average person’s approach to politics specifically, and the world around them generally, has fundamentally shifted in the 21st century, separating us into “teams” of adversaries. 
The reasons for this cannot be laid out in a black and white, causal approach. 
We do know that technology, such as social media, has had an effect, while a reliance on media content over real-world experience also contributes. Regardless, the danger is still there. What we have done, as a society, may have coalesced all the advancements of the modern age and allowed us to actually digress back to a time when human survival was based on allegiance to one’s tribe. 
Modern humans no longer have the same dangers as our nomadic ancestors, but that privilege has allowed us to take those instincts and manufacture crises or issues across tribes that result in a team vs. team dialectic, complete with merchandise, uniforms, winners, and losers. 
We’ve ‘gamified’ our society and it is to our detriment. We actively participate in ritual tribalism but the stakes, in our myopic view, are not severe. It’s a game.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Michigan, we understand tribalism all too well. As a person of a certain age that was told he was to be a Detroit Lions fan in the mid-1970s, I understand the process. Through the geographical circumstances of my birth, I championed a team that, by all accounts, had no right to be championed. I made excuses for their failures, celebrated their very few victories (until recent years, of course), but I never wavered. My allegiance was rewarded with being a part of a group of long-suffering people that I could identify with. 
Our devotion to the Lions, again for no other reason than where we lived, bonded us in a noble cause. We showed our allegiance by wearing the gear and flying the flags. And when other teams of people dared speak ill of the beloved Lions there could be vitriolic arguments. That is a process we are all familiar with, but the misapplication of that process into our political discourse is troubling.
Take, for example, Ted Nugent’s recent visit to the Michigan Legislature. As an avid outdoorsman and aging rocker, Nugent’s presence in front of that body was not to testify, but to chastise the members and call for wildlife conservation efforts to be further deregulated. He was asked to attend and address the lawmakers by a delegation of Republicans, not to affect policy change or bring real-world constituency issues to light, but as an armed celebrity endorsement.

From our national political fray down to local politics, these kinds of stunts are emblematic of the ‘gamification’ problem we face. Reality show presidents, newscaster cabinets, and celebrity guest stars in Lansing further the tribalistic approach and, much like trotting out a Hall of Fame quarterback from the past in order to drive ticket sales, the Nugent stunt is only a recent example.
Maybe the real culprit is Pac-Man or Zelda. As the Silent Generation and the older Boomers phase out, the generations born and bred on video games are in the majority, thus presenting anything as a winnable or losable achievement is attractive, prompting those same generations to choose sides and “play” their game. 
The gamification of our politics and our social norms isn’t new, just see earlier, historical, attempts at an ‘us vs. them’ approach to nationalism, but the current atmosphere is dangerous. 
Painting the other team as a faceless group of NPCs (non-player characters in video games, who are usually expendable and a necessary conquest for winning) further entrenches us into our tribal teams. 
The recent briefing held by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Detroit painted a crisis at Michigan’s northern border with Canada, wherein border crossers intent on harming God-fearing and innocent Michigan citizens must be stopped at all costs.

More examples can be found in the cheering and celebration of a sovereign nation bombing another sovereign nation. Just like a game of Risk, there aren’t real human beings maimed or killed, only those other players who are only as real as a voice in a headset when playing Call of Duty.
The above examples are, at their core, benign ones. Outside of mental disease or defect, the average person does not allow the winning and losing gamification of their fandom to result in violence. But what happens when the tribe raises the stakes? What happens when it changes from a sports team and to a president or prime minister? 
The gear and the flags remain the same, so the merchandise feels very game-like, but when your team believes that their very existence is at stake and the opposing team is just a character in the drama, then we have become monstrous. This has allowed us to openly celebrate the murder of fellow human beings and the destruction of homelands. Worse yet, by viewing our adversaries as nothing more than a ‘final boss’ it is so, so easy to actively pursue their defeat by any means necessary.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.

Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Sheyla Muñoz Garcia came to the United States from Mexico 15 years ago. All five of her children are U.S. citizens. On Friday, she became a citizen, too.
Muñoz Garcia was one of 40 new U.S. citizens who took the oath of allegiance at the William L. Guy Federal Courthouse in Bismarck to complete the final step of their naturalization process.
She said she decided to become a citizen this year to ensure that her permanent residency status could never be revoked.
“I had my green card and I was just trying to make sure my status is here, you know, because all my kids are Americans,” Muñoz Garcia said. 
She said she previously lived in Oklahoma, but decided to raise her family in North Dakota because she felt safe in the Peace Garden State.
“The kids really enjoy the outside at the farm and everything,” she said. Muñoz Garcia just gave birth to her youngest daughter 10 weeks ago and she was overjoyed to have her whole family in the courtroom to see their mother join them as citizens.

The kids are too young to understand the impact of watching her become a citizen, she said, but one of her daughters cried and pleaded with her recently, “I don’t want you to stop being Mexican.”
“I was like, ‘It’s not like that, it doesn’t go away, it’s in our blood. But we have to share great memories with the American culture, too,’” Muñoz Garcia said.
She also celebrated her 28th birthday on Friday, which she said made the naturalization ceremony a “great gift.”
Another new citizen, Jayla Crouse, is from the Philippines and has lived in the United States for seven years. She said she decided to become a citizen because her mother became one last year and she wanted to practice the same rights.
“The United States gave me a lot of opportunities here,” Crouse said. She said she’s studying to become a surgical technician at Bismarck State College and hopes to complete her coursework next year.
Olufemi Akinstan, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative from the Minneapolis field office, was on hand for the ceremony and ensured each new citizen had all of their naturalization paperwork before they left the building.
“It’s a joyful day for us and for the applicants,” Akinstan said.
Many of the new citizens have lived in the U.S for at least five years, he said. 
U.S. Chief Judge Peter Welte, who presided over the ceremony, told the new citizens to exercise the new rights granted to them by their citizenship, including the right to free speech, religion, assembly and the right to vote.

“These are rights that you have now,” Welte said. “And it was clear that the founders of this great land, of America, they considered that civic engagement at all levels was going to be vital to the success of this government.”
He said the group of new U.S. citizens came from countries such as Brazil, Canada, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia, Mexico, Philippines, Rwanda, Uganda, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
Ceremonies earlier this week in Fargo were expected to include about 200 new citizens from 51 countries, according to the U.S. District Court.
Welte gave the citizens a brief history of the United States’ conflicts, including the Civil War and its journey of freedom and liberty since its inception. He closed his remarks with a question: How does this story end?
“It’s up to you,” he said. “Because you are now, we the people … and I urge you to make this a story that ends well.”

(Courtesy of Immunize Colorado)Many Colorado lawmakers and medical experts were already concerned about how the Trump administration could shake up vaccine recommendations and access in the state. Then Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dismissed all 17 experts on the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing them with eight new members, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
But months before the changes at ACIP, state lawmakers approved a bill meant to insulate Colorado from vaccine policies that are inconsistent with scientific evidence. House Bill 25-1027 allows the state Board of Health to go beyond exclusively following ACIP for school vaccine requirements and consider recommendations from doctors’ groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians. It was signed into law in April.
State Sen. Lindsey Daugherty, an Arvada Democrat, was one of the bill’s sponsors. She said the provision that gives the state Board of Health more flexibility came from “discussions of what could be the worst thing that could happen (with ACIP), and how do we protect Colorado, future-looking?”
“Unfortunately, we’ve had to play on the defensive a lot in Colorado, and that’s something we take really seriously, because now, at least in Colorado, folks can look to science-based recommendations for vaccines for kids, instead of the politically-stacked ACIP,” Daugherty said.

The federal advisory committee, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is now chaired by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine.
The committee met for the first time with its new members on Wednesday and Thursday, and voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines. The committee also announced it will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and hepatitis B immunizations.
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” Kulldorff said during the commission meeting. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”










I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations.


– David Higgins, doctor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus


But many other doctors have raised concerns. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said that, ideally, states would not need to have separate vaccine recommendations. He added that with “the dismantling of ACIP,” the Colorado law is necessary.
“I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations,” Higgins said. 
Maintaining trust in vaccines
When parents of his patients raise concerns about the safety or effectiveness of vaccines, Higgins listens to them without judgment. He clears up misconceptions, answers questions and communicates the science behind vaccines.
“We as pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and are ready to listen and try to understand and address parents’ concerns about vaccines,” Higgins said. “Vaccine hesitancy is not new.”
What is new, though, is the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation on social media, and an erosion of trust in ACIP, Higgins added.
“With the CDC and ACIP bypassing normal processes that are in place to ensure recommendations are made with scientific integrity, transparency and thoroughness, trust is going to be degraded,” Higgins said. “It’s going to lower trust in those institutions and that will trickle down to less confident recommendations and lower trust from parents.”
Higgins is on the board of Immunize Colorado, a nonprofit that focuses on vaccine education. The organization hosts vaccine information sessions at clinics and local events. 
“We are constantly doing vaccine education, and we’re not a direct vaccine provider, but we educate the community,” said Susan Lontine, Immunize Colorado’s executive director.

Vaccine access protection
Recommendations made by ACIP can directly impact which vaccines insurance companies are obligated to cover. With that in mind, Colorado lawmakers in April passed Senate Bill 25-196, another preventive care-related law.
The law empowers the state insurance commissioner to maintain the coverage of state-regulated preventive measures, including vaccines, even if ACIP recommendations change. 
State Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, was one of the sponsors of that law, and of HB-1027. Mullica, an emergency room nurse, said it’s crucial that Coloradans get accurate information about vaccines and have affordable access to them.
“Americans are getting mixed signals and that’s really terrifying, because politics should not be in public health,” Mullica said. “We should rely on science.”
Amid significant vaccine misinformation, Kim Warner, an obstetrician and the president of the Colorado Medical Society, said one-on-one conversations between doctors and patients remain key.
“We can come out with recommendations all day long,” Warner said. “But I think sitting in the exam room and talking to patients about what vaccines are and aren’t, and what they do and what they don’t do, and answering their specific questions is one of the strongest things that we can do for patients.”

In a press release, the advocacy group Citizen Action of Wisconsin said “their flag reading the word ‘HUMAN’ in pride colors and its mount was ripped out of the side of the home and torn off of its flagpole.” 
“The flagpole had been bent, and the mounting bracket irreparably damaged,” Roe said at a press conference Thursday evening. “While we are grateful that no further property damage occurred, this incident reminds us that safety and dignity are still privileges not equally shared by all. This wasn’t just vandalism. This was a message.”
A local organizer told the Examiner that isn’t an isolated incident in the area, and speakers at the press conference talked about the impact of Pride flags on LGBTQ people. During the press conference, a new Pride flag went up at Roe and Frantz’s home.
“So today, on the 10-year anniversary of the federal legalization of same-sex marriage, we raise a new flag,” Roe said. “Not just in defiance, but in honor of all of those who have suffered because of hate, here in our community and everywhere that hate still exists.”
Police deemed what happened to Roe and Frantz a targeted attack, according to Citizen Action. 
Reiko Ramos, statewide anti-violence program director for the group Diverse & Resilient, which has a program that serves LGBTQ survivors of violence, shared a story at the press conference about a youth seeking the help of someone flying a Pride flag outside his home. 
“Complete strangers, they had never met,” Ramos said. “But they knew that his home was a safe place, that they could knock on their door. They were fleeing from their family, because they were experiencing domestic violence as a result of their identity… This youth actually knocked on the door and said, ‘I don’t know you, but I think you might be someone that I can ask for help.’” 
“And that is how this young person got connected to our services,” Ramos said. 
Mary Bogen, chairperson of the advocacy group Hate Free Outagamie (HFO), went to the press conference at Roe and Frantz’s home. She said she lives down the street.
“There’s a lot of people within this area that have had their Pride flags ripped down or had their houses vandalized for displaying pride flags,” Bogen said.
Bogen said that in some cases, she’s heard from people at Hate Free Outagamie events that they know who is responsible for stealing their Pride flag but don’t feel comfortable reporting it to the police. 
Bogen told the Examiner that  the LGBTQ+ community in Appleton is strong and thriving but that their resilience shouldn’t be necessary to walk down the street. 
“We often face open hostility, whether at a recent vigil we held for victims of the Pulse shooting or simply leaving a Pride event,” Bogen said. “People scream slurs from cars, film us for harassment, and sneer as if bigotry is a civic pastime. And too often, it’s done under the banner of a certain kind of patriotism. This isn’t just incidents, it’s a pattern. We refuse to accept it as normal. Our community deserves safety, respect, and the freedom to exist without fear. That’s why Hate Free Outagamie is working to establish a Trans Sanctuary in Outagamie County.”
In September 2023, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted to become a sanctuary for transgender and non-binary people, and Dane County made a similar decision earlier that year, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
Under the Milwaukee resolution, if the state of Wisconsin passes a law “that imposes criminal or civil punishments, fines, or professional sanctions on any person or organization that seeks, provides, receives or helps someone to receive gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers, hormones, or surgery, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors urges the Milwaukee County Sheriff to make enforcement their lowest priority.”
Vered Meltzer, a local alder and reportedly the first openly transgender individual to hold elected office in Wisconsin, said there is “still so much work to be done in Appleton to make things better, but we are the ones who build the world into the community that we want it to be.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal grant cuts to research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center could include funding for programs meant to improve diversity in medical research faculty and research participants, according to data released by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center — a medical system giant in the southeast that handles more than 3.5 million patient visits annually — expects to lay off 650 employees due to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration, the organization announced in a statement on June 20. Staffing cuts will be focused in research, administrative and support roles.
The health care system plans to reduce its operating costs by $300 million “in response to the impact of budgetary actions in Washington, D.C. related to government-sponsored research and patient care,” VUMC stated.
VUMC declined to provide more specific information on the research projects and grants impacted by federal cuts, but DOGE’s database indicates funding retractions for at least two multi-year VUMC initiatives receiving support from the National Institutes of Health.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center to lay off up to 650 after Trump administration grant cuts

The Vanderbilt Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (Vanderbilt FIRST) program aims to recruit more women and people of minority racial or ethnic groups to the faculty. 
“Scientific workforce diversity has been a longstanding challenge, and lack of progress negatively impacts innovation, scientific discovery, and ultimately public health,” the program’s description on federal grant database USASpending.gov states.
NIH allocated nearly $6 million toward the program, but the site shows about $1.4 million had been paid before the grant was scrapped, totaling an estimated $4.6 million loss for VUMC.
Another program aimed to bolster engagement for participants in research, particularly for participants of diverse backgrounds. 
“Our nationwide community of participants and researchers is partnering together to ensure that everyone is included in research,” the “All of Us” research program’s page on the NIH website states. “The information our participants generously share is fueling thousands of studies to better understand health and disease and enable more tailored and equitable approaches to care.”
Roughly $2.8 million was obligated for the latest “All of Us” initiative, and USASpending.gov shows about $2 million has been funnelled by the government, adding up to an $800,000 loss for VUMC.
While the DOGE database indicates the types of programs targeted for funding cuts by the Trump Administration, it does not present a complete picture of all funding cuts to an organization. The database may not be regularly updated to reflect the reinstatement of funds. Its data is also imperfect. A previous analysis by Tennessee Lookout found that while DOGE listed only one terminated grant worth $305,000 for Middle Tennessee State University, that grant was really one of several canceled grants with federal funding roots at the university. 
DOGE’s records show another unidentified grant for VUMC initially worth $27.4 million was terminated with $4.4 million left unpaid.
The staying power of NIH grant cuts is unclear. A federal judge ruled in a multi-state court case earlier this month that the Trump Administration must reinstate some grants after declaring their termination was “void and illegal.” The ruling’s order to restore grant funding applied only to grants mentioned in that lawsuit and another similar suit filed by the American Public Health Association.
VUMC is not listed as a party in either lawsuit.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)About 85,000 acres of backcountry in Tennessee could be opened for road construction, mining and logging under a Trump administration plan to remove protections from the most remote and untouched portions of U.S. national forests.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins last week announced the plan to rescind the “roadless rule,” which has preserved 59 million acres of public forests and grasslands across the nation since the Clinton administration adopted it in 2001, following decades of advocacy by conservation groups.
Rollins said the move is necessary to allow for wildfire management, create opportunities for the timber industry and reflects President Donald Trump’s mandate to ax “overcomplicated, burdensome barriers that hamper American business and innovation.”
Environmental groups say eliminating the rule puts wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests “on the chopping block” and clears the way for mining, oil and gas development and timber harvesting.
The announcement “shows this administration is completely out of touch with what Americans value in our public lands,” said Sam Evans, who leads the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program. 
The roadless rule contains specific exceptions for wildfire prevention and suppression, and for removal of non-native species.
“Saying this is about wildfire protection is not even a good fig leaf,” he said.

Of Tennessee’s 698,000 acres of national forested lands, 85,000 have protections under the current roadless rule. 
They include portions of Land Between the Lakes in northern Tennessee and pockets within the Cherokee National Forest that stretches for 660,000 acres across the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Beaver Dam Creek, Slide Hollow, Elk Creek, Bald Mountains, Horse Cove, Sycamore Creek are among the popular backcountry areas currently protected by the roadless rule.
U.S. Department of Agriculture officials did not respond to questions about the proposed rule but noted on its web site that “more information will be released as the rescission process gets underway.”
The process to eliminate a federal rule requires preparation of environmental analyses, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, tribal consultation and coordination with affected states in a public rule-making process, it said.

(Getty Images)Fertility treatment advocates have expressed concerns about a new Arkansas law they say is meant to cast doubt on the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technology, even though the law does not penalize or prohibit such treatments.
Act 859 of 2025, the Reproductive Empowerment and Support Through Optimal Restoration (RESTORE) Act, is “groundbreaking legislation that champions reproductive healthcare for women in Arkansas by prioritizing restorative reproductive medicine,” the conservative group Heritage Action for America said in an April news release.
The law defines “restorative reproductive medicine” as “a scientific approach… that seeks to cooperate with or restore the normal physiology and anatomy of the human reproductive system without the use of methods that are inherently suppressive, circumventive or destructive to natural human functions.”
Restorative reproductive medicine includes ultrasounds, blood tests, hormone measurements, exploratory surgeries, “natural procreative technology” and “fertility awareness-based methods,” among other things, according to Act 859.
The law goes into effect in August and requires Arkansas insurance companies to cover restorative reproductive medicine. This includes the Medicaid expansion program, Elizabeth Pitman, director of the Division of Medical Services for Arkansas Medicaid, told the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee in March.
  Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs (Arkansas Secretary of State)
The RESTORE Act’s sponsor, Heber Springs Republican Rep. Alyssa Brown, said at the same committee meeting that restorative reproductive medicine is not only more affordable than assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) but also is “less abrasive on the body and has higher success rates.”
“I want to be clear: This doesn’t limit anyone’s ability to access IVF,” said Brown, who did not respond to the Advocate’s requests for comment.
Brown’s statement was true, but Act 859 is still cause for concern, said Dr. Dean Moutos, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Little Rock’s Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology Associates. The clinic’s website includes a header that warns prospective patients against restorative reproductive medicine, saying it’s “not a medically proven alternative to IVF.”
“If you read between the lines, [Act 859] is a backhanded attack on assisted reproductive technology in my view, not because of what they say, but because of what they clearly omit” by not including proven methods such as IVF in discussions of fertility treatments, Moutos said in an interview.

He disputed the claim that assisted reproductive technologies are “suppressive” as supporters of restorative reproductive medicine claim.
“When they talk about natural procreation, restoring nature and all this other stuff, that’s great, but the patients I’ve seen have already tried that and it hasn’t worked,” Moutos said.
Similarly, the IVF advocacy group Resolve: The National Infertility Association is concerned that the rhetoric surrounding restorative reproductive medicine frames it as a necessary “first step before IVF,” and this could “take some of the autonomy from the patient,” Resolve Director of Government Affairs Alise Powell said in an interview.
“It’s concerning that folks are trying to deprioritize something that is evidence-based in favor of something that… folks are already doing in order to prepare themselves on their fertility journey,” Powell said.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which advocates for physicians that practice reproductive health care and fertility treatments, said restorative reproductive medicine “is not medical practice but ideology.”
“Its proponents create a false narrative that standard fertility care skips proper diagnosis or healing, when in fact, it is based on precisely those principles,” the organization stated.
Moutos said he was not surprised that assisted reproductive technology has come under conservative scrutiny in the three years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left abortion access up to the states. Arkansas has one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans, with a narrow exception to save the life of the pregnant individual.
IVF providers in Alabama, which also has one of the most restrictive abortion bans, temporarily halted operations in response to a February 2024 state Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children and if destroyed, a wrongful death lawsuit could be filed. State lawmakers later passed legislation providing criminal and civil protections for IVF clinics.
Republican President Donald Trump, who called himself the “father of IVF” on the campaign trail last year, issued an executive order earlier this year directing policy advisers to create a report on how to make in vitro fertilization more accessible for Americans.

What top IVF advocates want from the White House fertility care plan


 ‘Natural’ methods

Restorative reproductive medicine is “not mainstream medicine,” which merits the warning against it on the Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology website, Moutos said, but none of his patients have asked him about it because it lacks “traction with the general public.”
In addition to the insurance coverage requirement for restorative reproductive medicine, Act 859 also prohibits state-funded entities from penalizing a medical professional who declines to participate in fertility treatments due to “sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.”
Some branches of conservative Christian ideology disagree with assisted reproductive technology and condone only “natural” methods of conception.
Act 859 frequently mentions “fertility awareness-based methods,” such as tracking body temperature and hormone production during the menstrual cycle, as methods of assessing fertility without medical intervention. The law specifically cites the Billings Ovulation Method of fertility tracking, endorsed by the Catholic Church, which opposes artificial contraception. The law also cites the Creighton Model FertilityCare System, marketed as a “standardized modification” of the Billings method.
Moutos said these methods are not part of standard fertility treatment practices because they are “too unreliable” and have “a pretty high failure rate.”
The RESTORE Act requires the use of fertility awareness-based methods in programs funded by federal Title X family planning grant funds, which the Trump administration has attempted to withhold.

An earlier version of the RESTORE Act, which Brown amended in March, would have required the Department of Health to “implement reporting requirements for the standard of care for the diagnosis of infertility,” including “referrals to restorative reproductive medicine that are given before referrals for or use of assisted reproductive technology.”
Rep. Denise Ennett, D-Little Rock, said at the March committee meeting that she had issues with this portion of the bill because it could lead to privacy violations and discrimination via “the surveillance of tracking women’s personal health data.”
Brown told Ennett the intent of the deleted language was to “figure out how to update these services to better serve women who want to conceive.”
 Other legislation

A 2023 bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, would have charged abortion recipients with homicide and repealed sections of Arkansas law that protect IVF providers from prosecution if an embryo is damaged or discarded. The bill was never heard in committee.
Two other bills related to fertility treatments that Brown sponsored during the 2025 legislative session caught Moutos’ attention, he said, but neither made it out of committee.
The proposed Fertility Clinic Licensure Act would have created a special license for medical clinics that practice IVF in addition to their existing medical licenses.
The proposed Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act would have required fertility clinics to annually report to the state Department of Health how many embryos they fertilize and the outcomes of each one, ranging from discarding to full-term pregnancies.
Fertility clinics are already required to report this data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Moutos said.
Rep. Dolly Henley, R-Washington, said she was strongly opposed to the Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act. She voted against the RESTORE Act in the House Public Health committee in March because she mistakenly thought it was the other bill. Henley later realized her mistake and voted for the RESTORE Act when it passed the full House, she said in an interview.
Arkansas health care workers support national call to protect IVF

The law passed the House with the support of three Democrats — Reps. Glenn Barnes of Pine Bluff, and Joy Springer and Fred Allen of Little Rock — and 76 Republicans. It passed the Senate along party lines with all six Democrats voting against it.
Republican U.S. senators introduced the RESTORE Act on the federal level in May after the same bill did not advance in Congress last year. Conversely, Senate Democrats introduced legislation this year and last year to protect access to IVF.
A Democrat-sponsored bill to require Arkansas’ State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Program to cover IVF did not advance in the Legislature this year.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘No school like Freedom School’: Jackson students attend revived summer program,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/no-school-like-freedom-school-jackson-students-attend-revived-summer-program/,"Freedom Schools have especially deep roots in Mississippi, started as part of the 1964 Freedom Summer project.","A cacophony of children’s voices, punctuated by stomps and claps, echoed in the Cardozo Middle School gymnasium in West Jackson.
“Hold on, wait a minute, let me put some freedom in it!” about 50 kids chanted, while their parents held up their phones to record the moment. 
The Friday-morning event commemorated the end of Freedom School this summer — a free weeks-long program that promotes reading and leadership skills. The Children’s Defense Fund runs the program in 26 states every year, with more than 11,000 student participants, but Freedom Schools have especially deep roots in Mississippi.
As part of the 1964 Freedom Summer civil rights project, the first Freedom Schools aimed at fostering political and community engagement were founded in Mississippi. Three decades later, the Children’s Defense Fund revived the concept, opening their first schools in 1995. 
What exists now at Jackson Public Schools, the only district in Mississippi that has partnered with CDF since 2022 to operate Freedom Schools at three of their sites, is a “reimagined” version of what existed the summer of 1964. 
“It’s so important, when you think about what the teachers were able to accomplish that one summer,” said Kristal Moore Clemons, national director of the Freedom Schools program. “To have this rebirth and have children in 2025 learn about civil rights and the importance of being change agents and leaders, it’s just remarkable.”
For five days a week this past month, from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m., the students were led through a literacy curriculum, learned about history and practiced leadership skills. They read one book a week, and at the end of the program, they got to take a book home to build their own personal library. 
It doesn’t matter what reading level the students are at when they arrive — CDF trains college-age “servant leader interns” to meet the kids where they are and bolster their skills. 
Janai Virgil, an upcoming 4th grader at McWillie Elementary School, has been attending the summer program for two years now. Her mother, Jamila, spent a lot of time researching Freedom Schools to decide whether or not she wanted her daughter to attend. The focus on civic engagement made up her mind. 
“The students improve their reading skills over the summer, but they also learn about our history and their role in society,” she said. “This program helps them think about how they fit into the greater picture and how they can help not only themselves but their families and their local community, state and country, and that when we work together collectively we can achieve great things.”
Every June afternoon Jamila picked Janai up from Freedom School, the 9-year-old could barely contain her excitement telling her mother everything she’d learned, all the books she’d read and the rich conversations she’d had. 
“I can tell it’s affecting her and her desire to improve her community,” Jamila said. 
Additionally, Clemons said the program is greatly successful at preventing the dreaded “summer slide” — the loss of academic knowledge over summer vacation. And in Jackson, retaining reading skills is more important than ever.
The state’s reading gains have garnered national attention, but just over half of third-graders at Jackson Public Schools are reading on grade level. 
JPS board member Jeanne Middleton-Hairston was one of the proud adults in the crowd on Friday. As she watched on, the significance of the program resonated with her. 
Middleton-Hairston grew up in west Jackson. Her grandmother lived across the street from civil rights workers who came down the summer of 1964, and Medgar Evers’ office was two blocks away from her childhood home. 
“The history of Freedom Schools is part of the soil here,” she said. “It’s a safe place for them to come and know how brilliant and able they are and how working together makes everything better for everyone. There ain’t no school like Freedom School.”
So when the students started singing, Middleton-Hairston couldn’t help but get up and dance.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/27142216/IMG_5953.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

(West Virginia State Archives photo)“The U.S. tax system lacks this level of progressivity. The influence wielded by wealthy individuals and corporations over tax policy often leads to systems that favour the upper class, further exacerbating income inequality and placing a greater burden on the middle and lower classes.”- Dr. Farh Naz (March 2025)
I am a capitalist. I retired as a senior vice president with a national health care corporation. One of my clients was the Charleston Area Medical Center. 
But I know Dr. Naz is correct. Most Americans know little of our own history, and do not realize how wealthy special interests have historically controlled our lives. Here is one West Virginia example.
My best friend was a coal miner on the West Virginia/Pennsylvania border. But when asked, he knew nothing about the 1921 Blair Mountain uprising. I doubt many West Virginians do, especially younger ones. 
Given the rightward political turn of West Virginians over the past few decades, it’s important that they know this anti-capitalist aspect of their history. A good place to start is a West Virginia Archives and History publication named “The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920-1921” by Clayton D. Laurie.
A century ago, coal mine owners treated their underpaid and mistreated miners as virtual indentured servants. West Virginia’s politicians were in the pockets of mine operators, as were local officials. They did nothing to alleviate the suffering of commoners. The response of the powerless, exploited miners was to form unions, culminating in the 1890 formation of the United Mine Workers. 
Mine owners viciously opposed unionization, using “eviction, termination, blacklisting, yellow dog contracts, court injunctions, coercion and intimidation.” Still, unions were able to obtain limited power. By 1920, the UMW had grown to 50,000 members. 
This situation came to a violent head in what was known as the “Matewan Massacre.” The Matewan Massacre was a shootout between locals (including the sheriff), and outside private mercenaries (so called “detectives”) paid by the mine owners. Many people died, including Matewan’s mayor. 
Federal troops were brought in at the request of the governor (as opposed to Trump’s recent unilateral nationalization of the California National Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom). They quashed the miners wanting unionization and imposed martial law. 
The situation worsened over time, eventually resulting in the Battle of Blair Mountain. At Blair Mountain, 7,000 poorly armed miners wanting to unionize Logan County mines stood up to an army consisting of private mercenaries, the West Virginia National Guard, and Federal troops.
The miners were outgunned. After a five-day pitched battle, they lost, leading to a deterioration of the union. The UMW did not get back to its prior strength until the New Deal in 1933. 
During my decades in corporate America, I learned that corporations, like the West Virginia mine owners, have only one goal — profit. And the aim of corporate executives is to maximize their power, leading to the creation of personal wealth. These objectives lead to efficient operations in most cases (although not always). However, they increasingly lead to worker exploitation, as was historically true in West Virginia’s mines. 
Per a Pew Research report, our nation has tremendous inequities versus G-7 nations. This wealth gap is getting larger, doubling from 1989 to 2016. But there is a failure by the GOP base, which supported tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in 2017, to understand why. And that base still supports Trump’s extending these cuts now via his “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The average West Virginian would be better off with a blend of capitalism infused with socialism, like in Europe. We have some welfare programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Of course, no one acknowledges them as socialistic, which they are. 
They have become the third rail of American politics. And are with us for good, as Trump knows. But America must do more, including lowering the age for Medicare benefits, eliminating the 20% co-pay and eventually having Medicare for all Americans which would reduce current program waste and overhead. 
Regarding revenue generation, America can also do much more. For example, taxing all income for Social Security, rather than cutting off at $176,000 in 2025. And raising taxes on the rich and corporations, rather than extending Trump’s cuts. All it takes is the political will.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Speaking before the Kentucky Public Service Commission, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO Don Gulley recently praised the economic impact of the Nucor steel mill that began operating in late 2022 near the Meade County seat of Brandenburg. 
The Nucor Corp. says it employs more than 400 people to make steel plates for heavy equipment and infrastructure, including foundations for off-shore wind towers. Local elected officials in Meade County along with Gov. Andy Beshear have also hailed the project. 
“This was a massive effort to locate a large manufacturing company in Kentucky that would bring jobs, would bring secondary impact, would bring tax benefits and would be just generally good for the state,” Gulley said during a June 4 hearing. 
Now, much to Big Rivers’ dismay, an aspect of that deal is under scrutiny by the state’s utility regulator.
Big Rivers granted Nucor a significant discount on its large electricity bill in the form of millions of dollars of fuel costs that the steel mill didn’t have to pay. Those electricity costs, estimated by Gulley to be about $11 million a year, were instead passed on to Big Rivers’ approximately 121,000 ratepayers through 2031, under a contract between the utility and the company. The vast majority of Big Rivers’ ratepayers are residences and businesses. 
It’s unclear why a discount that’s been in place for several years has drawn the attention of the Public Service Commission (PSC) in recent months, but the scrutiny has spurred Big Rivers’ leaders and the three electricity distribution cooperatives that the utility supplies to warn the PSC against trying to change the contract.

(gray) and Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. (blue). The utility has its headquarters in Owensboro. (Source: Big Rivers Electric Corp.)
Gulley used the term “nuclear option” to describe the possibility that the PSC would order Big Rivers to refund to ratepayers the millions of dollars in fuel costs they covered for the steel mill.
Gulley said such a decision could force the nonprofit utility to seek an emergency rate increase  and impact the utility’s ability to meet its loan obligations. 
He said an emergency rate case “would be highly detrimental” and could have a significant “negative impact” on the utility’s credit rating and future costs to take out loans. 
It’s also not clear if ratepayers knew about the arrangement between Big Rivers and Nucor that had them covering a significant portion of the steel mill’s electricity costs. In a response to questions from the Lantern including if ratepayers were aware of the arrangement, a Big Rivers spokesperson said the utility couldn’t share much about the ongoing case. 
“We are very supportive of the unique Nucor development, which has provided numerous benefits to Big Rivers and its Member-Owners, as well as to the region and state,” Gulley said in a statement provided through the spokesperson. 
Questions over fuel costs
The contract between Big Rivers and the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg became a point of contention in recent months as the commission reviewed Big Rivers’ fuel adjustment clause, a provision that allows utilities to automatically pass through to ratepayers the changing costs of fuel, typically coal or natural gas in Kentucky.
The PSC regularly reviews utilities’ use of the fuel adjustment clause to make sure only reasonable costs are being passed on to ratepayers. The PSC can order a refund to ratepayers if it determines a utility has overcharged for fuel.
Big Rivers’ contract with Nucor exempted the industrial operation from paying its share of the variable fuel costs through the fuel adjustment clause.Those fuel adjustment clause costs were collected from other ratepayers instead, raising their fuel costs and utility bills.
Gulley, along with leaders of electricity distribution cooperatives Jackson Purchase Energy Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation and Kenergy Corp., argued to regulators the higher fuel charges for other ratepayers were well worth it because of the economic benefits that the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg had provided. 
The utility in a filing says the PSC approved the contract  including what the utility says are provisions that the commission is now questioning — with Nucor in 2020 — even if the utility received no PSC guidance or directive specifically allowing it to exempt Nucor from paying for variable fuel costs.
  Don Gulley, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO and president, urged the Public Service Commission not to require the utility to credit ratepayers for Nucor’s past fuel costs. (Screenshot/YouTube)
The utility argued the provisions in the contract were “necessary” to land Nucor in Meade County. 
“Undoubtedly, it has been a win,” Gulley said. “I’m not sure it was everything that was promised, but I also recognize that Nucor is an international company and operates on a global basis.” 
This question of ratepayers covering the cost of a large industrial customer’s discount arises at a time when power-intensive data centers are looking to negotiate electricity deals with utilities. 
“If utilities are going to be negotiating one-off special contracts with new large (electricity) loads, it certainly has the possibility of things like this being missed and socialized over to the bills of all the other ratepayers in Kentucky,” said Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council. 
Gary, whose group intervenes in utility regulation cases before the PSC, wasn’t involved in the Big Rivers case focusing on Nucor’s contract but did review the filings in the case before the PSC. 
But in an interview with the Lantern, Gary questioned whether the economic development arguments justify requiring other ratepayers to bear Nucor’s variable fuel costs, though he declined to offer an opinion on whether the arrangement was appropriate.
He also said the arrangement between Nucor and Big Rivers could potentially violate PSC precedent that requires companies subject to economic development electricity agreements to cover variable costs. 
Nucor contract has helped stabilize Big Rivers’ finances
Big Rivers has asked the PSC, which traditionally speaks through its written orders, for a decision. The utility also has suggested options the PSC could take that would allow the utility to maintain its arrangement, including offering ratepayers a report on the costs of fuel costs for the Nucor steel mill. 
During the June 4 hearing, Gulley said having Nucor as a customer has strengthened the utility’s recently shaky financial position. Big Rivers had to raise rates after aluminum smelters stopped purchasing power from the utility. Consumer advocates have previously raised concerns about significant increases  in utility bills and electricity costs for Big Rivers’ ratepayers in the past 15 years. 
“I have worked to change the focus at Big Rivers to serve our members and to be member focused. I’ve made great progress in the last 18 months,” said Gulley, who was hired as the utility’s president and CEO in 2023. “This is a pivotal moment for us, and we’ll chart the course for the next three to five years.”

(Courtesy photo from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation)The New England Patriots will keep parking their Boeing 767 planes at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport for another five years under a deal that keeps the Warwick hub as the team’s official airport.
And all it will cost the team is one dollar — along with a lot of courtesy advertising to boost the airport’s regional branding. 
That’s according to the agreement approved by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation this month which waives landing and parking fees for the team’s two jumbo jets at T.F. Green through July 2030. In exchange, the Patriots will continue to provide the Warwick airport with a series of promotional benefits including permission to use the team’s name and image in ads in every New England state, aside from Vermont.
The six-time Super Bowl champs must also provide T.F. Green signage along the endzone at each home game at Gillette Stadium, along with digital ads on the team’s website, mobile applications, and social media; and Patriot game radio spots.
T.F. Green has been the official airport of the Patriots since the two signed a similar deal in 2017.
“This agreement benefits both parties and allows us to advertise within our catchment area in a meaningful and cost-effective way that has helped us increase passenger volume,” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, said in a statement.
A Patriots spokesperson declined to comment on the renewed deal.
New ads are still in development by the Denver-based agency Karsh Hagan, according to Nikolas Persson, RIAC’s senior vice president of business development and information technology.
No firm numbers are listed in the new contract with the Patriots, aside from the estimated five million impressions that digital ads will likely provide the airport each football season. 
Charts provided to Rhode Island Current show airport officials waived nearly $527,000 worth of fees between 2020 and 2024 while the Patriots provided a little over $6.1 million worth of ads in that same period.
Whatever airport officials get out of the new deal, University of Rhode Island marketing professor Dan Sheinin sees the continued partnership with the Patriots as a way for T.F. Green to to set itself apart from regional competitors like Logan International Airport in Boston or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
“For Green, the component is to stay in the mental conversation,” he said. “I’m sure everybody knows it’s there — but if people don’t have any experience with the airport or haven’t been there for a long time, they probably don’t think about it.”
And there’s no bigger brand to boost that name recognition with than the National Football League.
“The NFL is one of the hottest culture and entertainment brands that exists,” Sheinin said. “Any brand or entity that’s affiliated with any aspect of the shield is going to get some sort of halo benefits from that — even if it’s a team that’s in the lower half of the league.”
It hasn’t been a good few years for the Patriots. The team is coming off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and has had two coaching changes. But the deal makers were apparently optimistic that the team can return to its winning ways, as the contract includes provisions for branding around postseason games.
“If the Patriots get back to being competitive, this kind of association will be even more valuable,” Sheinin said.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.

Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Getty Images)Our weekly newspaper — The Anderson News — is published on Thursdays. 
On Friday, June 20, I stopped at the Lawrenceburg Kroger to grab a copy of the paper, but the stack of issues was dated June 12, the week prior. I recalled being at our Walmart a few weeks earlier, on a Monday, and that The Anderson News from the previous week had still not been delivered. 
When I asked a busy clerk about this, she shrugged. “It comes when it comes.”
You might say I should get with the program and read my local newspaper online, but like many Kentuckians I live out a rural road and down a hill where the internet and even phone service can be spotty, so as long as The Anderson News is available in paper form, I choose paper. This is also how I track what little news is in our newspaper these days, and I am coming to the sad realization that we are witnessing the slow, suffocating, untimely death of our once-robust community newspaper.
There is a fairly famous essay titled “Drowning doesn’t look like drowning” by Mario Vittone that gets reprinted by a number of news outlets every summer. Vittone lists a handful of unexpected things to look for and stipulates that “Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for, is rarely seen in real life.”
Similarly, the death of local news can be deceptively quiet. No big boss in a three-piece suit comes to town, hands out pink slips, and shuts down a printing press with a loud hiss. 
Here in Anderson County, Kentucky, population 24,000, there still exists a newspaper; there is a pop-up-ad-heavy website that’s updated weekly; there are still paper-papers, albeit sometimes delivered late, in neat, familiar stacks near the front doors of Kroger, Walmart and the gas station where you can see what is above the fold; there are still obituaries and high school sports and a report that a county or city meeting occurred. 
But there is no context, historical or otherwise, no investigations to speak of, and no — how do I say this? — life.
As a freelancer, I regularly wrote commentary for The Anderson News from 2017-2020. Back then there was an office, an experienced and dedicated editor, a front desk clerk, and at least one reporter and/or sports reporter on staff. To say we had an engaging opinion page or letters the the editor page (sometimes two full pages) is an understatement. Our newspaper was our town square, so much so that I would often grab coffee and a paper at the Five Star gas station first thing on the morning the paper came out and drive to a friend’s office before 9 a.m. to banter about what was happening in town.
In May 2021, Paxton Media Group announced that it had purchased The Anderson News and dozens of other community newspapers. “We are very excited to add these newspapers into the PMG portfolio,” said Jamie Paxton, PMG president and CEO. “PMG believes strongly in the value of local newspapers and the vital role they play in the communities that they serve.”
Vital role? The Anderson News is an anemic shell of itself at, most weeks, eight pages. 
The opinion page and letters to the editor no longer exist, signaling lack of community input and engagement. 
Reports on city and county meetings are rote, reading more like meeting minutes than reportage or analysis. Investigations, in-depth interviews and follow up are non-existent.
There is a full page dedicated to religion, and politicians like state representative James Tipton, state senator Aaron Reed, and U.S. Rep. Andy Barr are often given half or almost-full pages to communicate their political agendas to the public.
Multiple datelines in our June 12 paper, for example, read BARDSTOWN, LOUISVILLE, LEXINGTON. In other words, not here.

It is often said that newspapers don’t make money, so what can we expect? What about capitalism? Here I will argue that newspapers, like the government, do not exist to make money. Newspapers and government agencies exist (or *should* exist) to serve the people. When newspapers and/or government entities are tasked to focus on profit profit profit, like a business with shareholders, citizens’ needs become collateral damage.
Case in point: Billionaire Elon Musk was tasked by the current president to rid government agencies of waste, fraud and abuse via his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But for all the hoopla, Reuters reports, ”DOGE is not a serious exercise,” said Jessica Riedl, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank that supports streamlining government. She estimates DOGE has only saved $5 billion to date, and believes it will end up costing more than it saves.”
On the newspaper side, what we have learned in Anderson County is that when your local newspaper is starved of the resources to report enough news to keep citizens informed in a timely manner, beware of what will fill the void. 
Enter the “Lawrenceburg Catch All.” 
According to their Facebook page, Lawrenceburg Catch All was created two years after Paxton Media Group purchased The Anderson News. There are three administrators, more than 9,000 members who can post anonymously if they choose to, and there appears to be no checking of sources or facts. During recent breaking news in which almost our entire city fire department resigned, citizens found what they wanted to know — true or not — in the Lawrenceburg Catch All and in Lexington TV news, not our newspaper.
Last week I asked locals to describe the Lawrenceburg Catch All in one word. This is what they told me: drama, embarrassing, breaking news, meanness, a soap opera, ugly, funny, trouble, misinformation, s**t, a train wreck. And yet they all still check this page as their news source because, as one man said, “Where else am I supposed to look?”
Drowning doesn’t look like drowning, and living in a news desert does not mean your newspaper was shuttered with fanfare like they do in the movies.
One day you find out that your newspaper has been purchased by a corporate consolidator like Paxton Media Group who claims to care about journalism and your community. 
Then you learn that your newspaper’s longtime editor has been replaced by a preacher-turned-editor who soon goes back to being a preacher. They tell you everything is fine because yet another editor, who is in a different county and in charge of multiple newspapers, is now the editor, and that your town has one reporter who lives somewhere else.
Months later, you are driving through town when you notice your newspaper’s office has been quietly closed and that “The Anderson News” sign you used to drive by every day, near the Dairy Queen, has been removed from the marquee. 
One day in the very near future, you, too, may live in a town where local news is just a private Facebook group moderated by people you don’t know and where group members who can post anonymously are the sources.
This is the definition of a news desert.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24. 
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.” 
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.
I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump Administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case. 










The simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.


The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values. 
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-SLC_SH_02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 06:02:16.336995

Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, warning of the potential risks to health care access for people who need it the most.
US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured

Provider assessment rates and state-directed payment programs are at risk — two funding mechanisms that are critical to hospital operation in Virginia and that determine how hospitals chip into the state’s expanded Medicaid coverage. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association estimated each program could take a $2 billion hit, if the proposal is fully implemented. 
The measure ignited fresh controversy in recent days, as hospitals warned against adjusting the assessment rates from 6% to 3.5%. Over the weekend, members of U.S. Senate began floor debate on the bill, which key Republican senators like Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, had said they would not vote to advance because of the assessments adjustment proposal and the damage it could do to rural hospitals in their states.
Late Saturday, Hawley and all but two other GOP senators voted to advance a new version of the bill that included a $25 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 to 2032. Critics, however, still caution that fund will not fill the financial gaps as states lose portions of federal funding through the Medicaid cuts.
In a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia said he doesn’t plan to vote for the bill as it stands. The week prior his Senate colleague, Democrat Tim Kaine said the same. As the bill proceeds to what is called a vote-a-rama, Senate Democrats have remained in opposition to the bill.
The possible Medicaid changes are part of an overall budget package that President Donald Trump dubbed the “one big beautiful bill” and has pressured Congress to send to his desk by July 4.  While there is still more time for deliberations before the Senate votes whether to send the bill to Trump and he potentially signs the Medicaid changes into law, hospital associations warned in their letter that if he does, vulnerable, already-cash-strapped hospitals would struggle to keep their doors open or need to cut the services they offer.
“Stable funding is vital not only for serving Medicaid beneficiaries but also for providing care to all patients, including the uninsured, those with commercial insurance, and our seniors and disabled patients on Medicare,” the associations wrote, representing hospitals in North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. “Severe cuts to Medicaid inevitably would lead to cuts in healthcare services for all Americans.”
The hospital funding mechanisms aren’t the only Medicaid changes that Congress is considering.
A version of the bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives includes work requirements to access Medicaid. Though most Medicaid recipients do work, some use Medicaid while they are unable to work due to disabilities or illness. Such is the case for Richmond-area resident Aida Pacheco’s daughter who is out of work while she battles cancer.

Still, the twice-a-year-proof of employment required by that version of the bill could make it challenging for eligible people to stay on Medicaid and overwhelm some government employees with additional work, Warner said. 
He referred to the bill as “budget gimmickery” riddled with “poison pills,” from Medicaid changes to cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — which could place additional cost burdens on local and state governments. Twenty-three governors have sent a letter to Congress on that matter recently, which Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin didn’t sign. 
Meanwhile, some of Virginia’s federal lawmakers would like to see the president sign the House version of the bill.
Last week Virginia’s 1st District congressman Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, joined a letter in opposition to the Senate draft that reiterated support for the House version of the bill.

“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
After the House’s version of the bill passed by a single vote, Democrats blasted Wittman for his support of it, which could affect about 250,000 Virginians. Wittman asserts eligible Medicaid recipients will not lose coverage and has noted his personal connection to the program. Medicaid coverage allowed his birth mother to continue her pregnancy and his parents to eventually adopt him, he said.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” Wittman said in a recent statement.
 Back to the drawing board?

Amid all the pushback to the Medicaid tweaks in the bill, the Senate’s parliamentarian set Republican’s plans back in a Thursday ruling that found several measures didn’t comply with the federal reconciliation process. Lawmakers then spent the weekend reworking the bill. Though Republicans didn’t back down on their sought changes to the hospital provider taxes in Medicaid, they agreed for the cuts to be delayed and incremental. 
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

As an adviser to the chamber, Thune has said lawmakers won’t challenge the parliamentarian’s ruling, which included other reforms they’ve sought, like reducing federal funds to states that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants and a bar on patients tapping into Medicaid for gender-affirming care.
Thune told Politico late last week that Republicans may not get “everything that we want” on the provider tax, but that he hopes his party can salvage “most of the reforms.”
Warner said he hopes Republican congresspeople will be “willing to go back to the drawing board and actually work with both parties.”
For now, he thinks it will be “a bumpy next couple of days, but this is a bad bill for America. It’s a bad bill for Virginia.”

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) The U.S. The Department of Agriculture is about to undo the 2001 Roadless Rule that has protected 59 million acres of national forests from being developed or logged for decades. Virginia boasts the most inventoried roadless areas in the southeast, 394,000 acres, which would be opened up for development once the rule is axed. The state has over 1.6 million acres of forest in the National Forest System.
The USDA reports that 30% of the National Forest System lands are restricted from road development through this rule. The Trump Administration has framed this as an impediment to the land being managed for fire risk and said it is hindering economic development in rural America.
“Once again, President Trump is removing absurd obstacles to common sense management of our natural resources by rescinding the overly restrictive roadless rule,” said USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins in a meeting of the Western Governors’ Association. “This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land.”
The rule was created as a way to maintain some of the least-developed parts of the nation to protect wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests. The rule has been contested in the courts many times as states sought to utilize the lands but has been upheld in most cases.
As for the agency’s concerns over wildfires, the rule already has exemptions to manage fuel reduction through thinning of trees, prescribed burns, creating fuel breaks and removing brush. However, logging groups feel it’s not sufficient to address the dangers the forests face from wildfires.
“With those limited exceptions it hasn’t been enough to effectively manage the forest and reduce wildfire hazards and the disease infestation of bugs,” said Scott Dane, Executive Director of the American Loggers Council.
Dane said that limiting access to these lands has, in a way, contributed to shutting down logging across the country with the collapse of the mill infrastructure. From the logging perspective, he said the Roadless Rule was an anti-logging industry policy and stepped away from proper management of the national forests.
“Look at the catastrophic wildfires that we’ve had, and the U.S. Forest Service has come out with a wildfire crisis plan, because it is a crisis. The only way you can reduce the wildfire threats is to reduce the fuel loads, and the fuel loads are excessive right now,” Dane said. “The U.S. Forest Service needs to get back to managing the national forest like they used to do. And this rule, in and of itself, is not the sole reason that the health of the National Forest has declined over the last 25-30 years, but it’s one of the reasons.”
Environmental groups were quick to denounce the move by the federal government to open forestlands. The Southern Environmental Law Center said the rule was especially important for the southeast where land has been fragmented by roadbuilding and mining.
“They are the places that you’re gonna find old-growth forests. Virginia is lucky to have a lot of old-growth forest where you can find it in these roadless areas,” said Sam Evans, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Virginia also is lucky to have a wealth of clean streams and rivers. Five-hundred and forty miles of rivers in Virginia alone are protected primarily by the roadless rule.”
Even with the roadless rule’s future in question, the protected lands won’t be opened to free-for-all development. Formal rulemaking to undo the rule will be needed and it is likely to be challenged in court, as past changes were during the Bush Administration. 
“The Forest Service is going to have to explain why those things aren’t important enough to protect anymore. It is hard for me to see how they could do that credibly,” Evans said.
Another hurdle: even if the rule is rescinded, logging projects would still need to go through the Forest Service’s application process, which is subject to review in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.
But logging is not the only industry that could expand if the rule is undone. Oil and gas, hydropower, and mining could utilize the protected lands. Evans said when the rule originally was proposed in January 2001, most supporters said they wanted these protections in place for the wilderness portions of the country. He suggests it will be difficult for the Forest Service to convince the public the land should be allowed to be developed.
“An unprecedented number of people showed up to say that they wanted these protections, and that has continued to be true across the board irrespective of political affiliation, whether you live in the city, or you are in a rural area,” Evans said. “People really care about protecting the integrity of these lands and don’t want to see them converted into timber production.”

(Photo by Catherine Lane/Getty Images)Students in Virginia who rely on Pell Grants to help pay for college may soon face higher costs under a sweeping set of federal education reforms being considered by the U.S. Senate.
The Pell Grant program is the primary source of federal financial aid for low-income students, supporting degree completion at both public and private institutions. During the 2023-24 school year, Virginia’s public and private universities reported to the state that they had 144,116 Pell Grant recipients.
“It has been one of the great successes in helping lower-income families and students pursue a degree,” said Sabena Moretz, director of government relations and member services for the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV). 
According to CIVC, 82% of students at Virginia’s private colleges receive financial aid, with an average award of $25,000. The association represents 28 accredited, nonprofit, independent colleges and universities around the commonwealth.
However, the proposed changes come as no surprise.
Back in 2016, President Donald Trump took aggressive steps to roll back Obama-era higher education measures, including a proposal to rescind the Gainful Employment Regulations that aimed to protect students from predatory programs.
In the latest effort, the Trump administration is backing a new legislative push dubbed the “One Big Beautiful bill,” a package of higher education reforms that includes changes to federal student loan programs, repayment rules, and institutional accountability. Supporters say the reforms would expand the Pell Grant to workforce training programs and help break the student debt cycle. 
Meanwhile, Democrats have opposed the bill, arguing that it would make college less affordable, eliminate borrower safeguards and protect predatory colleges.
One proposal in the bill would prohibit students from receiving a Pell Grant if their total grant aid from federal, state, institutional and private sources meets or exceeds their total cost of attendance — the estimated expenses for one year of college. These costs typically include tuition, room and board, and textbooks.
The changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2026.
A spokesperson for the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, declined to comment on the proposal. However, the office stated that it’s uncommon for financial aid to exceed a student’s costs of attendance.
“Having total aid exceed cost of attendance would be a rare occurrence, though it does happen,” said Lee Andes, SCHEV’s director of finance policy and innovation. “Since most financial aid rules (including the state) would require a reduction in aid under the scenario described, the student would receive no harm under the new federal policy compared to current policy.”  
Andes said that under both policies, a student would be limited to receiving no more aid than the total cost of attendance. 
“Traditionally, Pell has been treated as a first-in grant; this policy makes it somewhat ambiguous how it would be treated and which programs are reduced first. I would anticipate federal guidance to follow any change in the law,” Andes said.
CIVC said it is monitoring the discussion but remains concerned about how the proposal could impact students and institutions. Students at CIVC member institutions received $214 million in Pell funds during the 2023-24 school year. Moretz said if students find the application process difficult, they may choose to not enroll. 
In addition, if students no longer receive such grants, they may be unable to attend those institutions at all.
“The more complicated we make financial aid, the less likely students are to be able to follow along and to be successful at getting through the application process, and that does not serve students well,” Moretz said.
Virginia is not alone in its concerns about how the bill could impact students and colleges.
Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, wrote in a May 21 letter to House representatives that the council is concerned about changes to the Pell Grant eligibility, the availability of federal student loans for graduate students, new and increased taxes imposed on institutions of higher education, and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.
“If enacted, this bill will put college out of reach for hundreds of thousands of students, significantly increase the costs for remaining students, and weaken America’s ability to compete with our global rivals by undermining the academic and research system that has driven our economy for decades,” Mitchell wrote.
The Senate is also considering eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program, which provides funding for graduate students, potentially forcing them to seek private loans. Additionally, lawmakers are  weighing a new endowment tax targeting wealthy private institutions.
The endowment tax would raise the current 1.4% on private university endowments to a tiered rate based on endowment per U.S. student, excluding non-U.S. citizens from the calculation.
Democrats and other critics argue that the tax could also reduce funding for financial aid, research, and other essential operations.
The Senate is currently reviewing the bill, which passed the House last month.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)At one time or another, every one of us is impacted by a health emergency or life-changing event like the birth of a child. These moments in our lives can be all-encompassing, even when the underlying event is a joyful one.
Ask any parent. 
Adjusting to life with a baby is rich with stress, especially for single mothers like me. I am a single mom by choice. I gave birth to my son in May 2023. 
As a teacher, I received no paid time off for his birth. But because I gave birth at the end of May, I was able to stay home with him through the summer. 
Knowing that I did not want to leave my son at three-months-old, I took my 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in the fall and returned to work after Thanksgiving.
I spent the full year before his birth squirreling away every cent I could save, even diverting the money I would have invested toward my retirement. I managed to save $12,000, which was no easy task. However, it was nowhere near enough to support my son and me. It was gone, along with other savings, before it was time for me to return to work. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thankfully, I have a very supportive family and was able to keep my head above water. 
Barely.
But here we are, my son just turned two-years-old in May, and I am still working to put myself back into a financial situation I’m more accustomed to and comfortable with at this point.
It is not easy. 
With a monthly daycare bill of $1,650, there is not much left over to spend at the end of the month, as I try to put a cushion back under my little family. 
My story is not unique. Many parents want to take time off to care for their newborns but find it financially impossible to do so.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Many countries offer paid family leave for new parents. So do 13 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., including four of our neighbors, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.
There is no reason that Pennsylvania cannot do the same by offering paid family and medical leave for people who experience serious health conditions or life-changing events, like the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Leave should also be available to people who are caring for sick loved ones as well as victims of domestic violence.
A program like this would give Pennsylvania parents like me peace of mind by allowing them to care for their newborns without going broke. It would also allow family members to provide critical care to elderly loved ones at home without having to risk their jobs or financial security.

It is no wonder that a March 2025 poll by Osage Research for Children’s First PA found that 81% of Pennsylvanians support a paid family and medical leave program.
It’s also a win for employers who want to hang on to great employees. Studies (here, here and here) show that women with limited paid family leave are more likely to leave employment after childbirth or a health emergency, while those with paid family leave are more likely to return.
I wouldn’t change anything about the first six months of my son’s life, but I know that not everyone can do what I did. It breaks my heart to think of new moms returning to work just six or seven weeks after giving birth.
We can do better. We can empower working Pennsylvanians to provide critical care to their families when they need them. And we can do it in a way that benefits employees and employers, while keeping good people in their jobs.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)In Wise County earlier this month I met the candidate daring enough, or foolish enough, to run against the most powerful Republican member of Virginia’s House of Delegates. 
When I walked into the community center in Norton, where I was to give a presentation at the invitation of the Clinch River Coalition, I found a volunteer wrangling wires to plug in the audio equipment. He was introduced to me as Josh Outsey, the man who had taken on the thankless job of Democratic challenger to Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, in this fall’s election. 
Before I could stop myself, I laughed. Terry Kilgore has been in the House for 31 years, and ran unopposed in the last three elections. A politically powerful member of a politically powerful family, Kilgore represents a district that’s over 92% White and voted 83.1% for Donald J. Trump. The 63-year-old lawyer was recently elected House Republican leader.
Kilgore chosen to lead Va. House GOP as Gilbert prepares for possible exit

Joshua Outsey (pronounced OOT-see), 38, is a Black actor, singer and community organizer. As of June 5, Kilgore had raised $469,509, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Outsey had raised $200. 
Outsey gives a respectable pitch for his candidacy, grounded in both experience and policy. If this were a contest for a seat in a more balanced district, I’d have no business being amused. But no one, least of all Outsey, is under any illusions that he can unseat Kilgore. 
Still, I am filled with admiration. It is one thing to say that democracy works best when voters have choices, and quite another to agree to make yourself that choice against impossible odds. 
I’ve seen up close what even a hopeless campaign can require. A couple or three decades ago, my friend Tom Horton ran for Congress against a well-funded Republican incumbent who was firmly entrenched in Virginia politics. Tom had no trouble securing the Democratic nomination – nobody else wanted it – but he didn’t have money for a staff, and he needed a policy director. I was at home with young children and glad for the mental stimulation, so I signed on. 
Unburdened by any real prospect of success, I had a great time writing position papers based largely on my own opinions. Every once in a while, I would stop and ask myself, “I wonder what Tom thinks about this?” then shrug and plunge on. Very occasionally, Tom would balk at a position I proposed he take, and then we would talk it out.
But mostly, he didn’t have time for that. Poor Tom spent every day of the campaign on the phone trying to raise money. In the evenings he knocked on doors. If he was lucky, sometimes he was interviewed on the radio or got a quote in the paper. It was an uphill slog all the way, and none of it mattered. He lost by about the same wide margin that polls had shown him losing by at the outset of the campaign. 
He had to be disappointed, but Tom told me he loved every minute of it and would run again in a heartbeat, if he didn’t have a family to support.
Maybe this is why I have a special place in my heart for underdogs. People like Tom who try, knowing they are likely to fail, and then indeed do fail, only to pick themselves up and say it was worth it anyway – they are heroes to me. Winners are dull by comparison. 
Outsey is far from being the only sacrificial lamb this election. Democrats are fielding candidates in every House race this fall, including other long-shot seats like those held by Will Morefield, another coalfields delegate who won in 2023 with 85% of the vote, and Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, who won his Shenandoah Valley district by more than 77%.
Republicans are not similarly contesting every seat, but some are taking on Democratic incumbents even in deep blue districts, including a few who are making a repeat appearance on the ballot.
These include retired technology professional Kristin Hoffman, who is challenging McLean Democratic Del. Rip Sullivan for the second time, in spite of losing by 23 points in the last election. A few miles to the east, in another Fairfax County district that voted overwhelmingly for Harris over Trump last fall, retired federal worker Ed McGovern will face Del. Kathy Tran for a third time. He lost by 20 points in 2021 and 30 points in 2023.  
I was unsuccessful in trying to reach these folks, so I don’t know their motivations. Regardless, I salute them.
Running against impossible odds can serve a purpose beyond dedication to the democratic process. Democrat Melody Cartwright told a Cardinal News reporter that she sees running for a second time against Del. Eric Phillips, R-Henry, after losing in 2023 by 40 points, as a way to support Abigail Spanberger’s gubernatorial campaign. She added candidly that forcing Republicans to spend money to defend Phillips’ seat would leave them less money to attack Democrats elsewhere.
Despite tough challenge, don’t underestimate Earle-Sears

Running for office with no expectation of winning can also be a tactic for raising awareness of a neglected cause, as many a Green Party candidate can attest. My colleague at the Mercury, Roger Chesley, recalls a candidate by the name of Gail Parker who ran for various local, state and federal offices seven times between 2006 and 2019. Calling herself “Gail for Rail,” she campaigned on the single issue of promoting light rail. A 2007 Washington Post headline snarkily called her a “One-Track Candidate.” Fair enough, but the record will reflect that Metro now extends out to Loudoun County. 
Deep in the heart of every candidate, of course, is the hope that lightning may strike. The opponent might stumble badly enough, or voters suddenly realize that who they wanted all along was someone just like the scrappy upstart, leading to an upset victory. 
It has happened. In a 2014 primary, libertarian college professor David Brat defeated Congressman Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader at the time, in an upset that shocked the political establishment and gave hope to long-shot candidates everywhere. Brat won the general election, too, and served two terms.
Brat’s win over Cantor, followed by his loss to a Democrat in 2018 – to Abigail Spanberger, as it happened – demonstrates a final point: the political winds can shift suddenly, and when it happens, the people who benefit are the ones who’ve got their sails ready. 
Democrats have been able to field so many candidates this year because they sense such a shift coming as part of a backlash to the Trump presidency. Republicans say otherwise. Still, no matter which party wins control this fall, the outcome won’t help the longest of long-shot candidates. 
But that’s okay. Just running is a win for democracy.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Renewed efforts by some lawmakers for the state to adopt a system where voters elect the state’s constitutional officers again failed this year. 
Maine is an outlier in having the Legislature appoint constitutional officers and state auditors. Rather than giving that power to state legislators, most states popularly elect their treasurer, secretary of state and attorney general. States vary more on how they select auditors. 
For decades, some lawmakers have proposed changing the selection process, such as allowing the public to decide instead through a direct popular election, but such attempts have failed. 
The Maine House of Representatives and Senate killed all of the proposals to change the selection process this year. 
LD 455, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), would have amended the constitution to require the popular election of the secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer. Both chambers voted against it, so it died upon adjournment on Wednesday.  
LD 508, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), sought to essentially do the same. The Senate indefinitely postponed it on June 11, killing the bill, on a motion from Bennett. 
Other bills, all sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), focused on switching to popular elections for specific positions. 
LD 150 proposed a constitutional amendment to allow for the popular election of the state treasurer. It also died after the Senate followed the House in rejecting it earlier this month.  
That’s also the case for LD 147, which proposed a constitutional amendment to require the popular election of the secretary of state, and LD 149 that would do so for the attorney general. 
Bennett also offered an alternative election process for constitutional officers and the state auditor in LD 1193. Instead of a popular election, this bill would still have the Legislature elect these positions but with an open ballot system, under which a lawmaker’s vote would be publicly available. 
However, LD 1193 remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment. Since it was not one of the bills carried over into next year, the bill died when the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday. 
Sen. Richard Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) proposed in LD 1068 switching to popularly elect the state auditor, though not through a constitutional amendment. That bill also remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment and died since it was not carried over. 
The state auditor is not a constitutional officer, however another bill, LD 1052, sought to make it one through a constitutional amendment. 
Sponsored by Rep. Suzanne Salisbury (D-Westbrook), the bill passed both chambers in initial votes, however failed enactment in the House, which was the crucial vote as constitutional amendments need to win the support of two-thirds of lawmakers for enactment. The bill was then placed on what’s called the appropriations table because it required funding. 
Constitutional amendments ultimately have to be approved by voters even if they pass the Legislature, and therefore always have associated ballot costs. 
The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which manages the table, decided not to fund LD 1052 this year but it will be carried over into next year for consideration. (More on that here.) Though, if funded next year, this bill would still face a steep path to passage given the failed enactment in the House.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Thursday marked the last chance for New Hampshire lawmakers to approve or reject the remaining bills of this year’s legislative session.
While passage of a state budget was the main focus in Concord, lawmakers also voted on several bills that came out of this month’s committees of conference. The committees, made up of House and Senate negotiators, formulated compromises on bills that both chambers had passed but in different forms. On Thursday, the full chambers voted to either accept the compromises or kill the bills.
Bills passed on Thursday now head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, where she will have the option to sign them into law, veto them, or allow them to become law without her signature. Meanwhile, other hotly debated bills met their demise Thursday.
Here’s a look at some of the votes.
Gender affirming care for minors banned
After an emotionally charged debate, Republicans in the House and Senate passed two bills that would ban all gender transition surgery and medication treatment for minors. 
House Bill 712 prevents New Hampshire doctors from performing breast surgeries to assist with gender transitions; the bill would allow such surgeries only to treat “malignancy, injury, infection, or malformation.”
And House Bill 377 bars doctors from prescribing hormone therapies and puberty blockers to minors for the purpose of gender transition, as well.
The two bills, if signed by Ayotte, would come on the heels of a 2024 law that banned gender transition genital surgeries
The bills passed a week after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such state laws in U.S. v. Skrmetti. 
Democrats denounced the bills, saying they would prevent adolescents with gender dysphoria from obtaining treatment that could improve their lives and prevent depression and suicide, and arguing that the decision of whether to pursue such treatment should be made by doctors and parents.
Republicans said there is not enough research backing up the treatments, and raised concerns that the treatments could be permanent and create trauma if children later regretted them.
Libraries and kids’ borrowing histories
Another bill accepted Thursday and headed to the governor’s desk seeks to allow parents access to their children’s borrowing history at public libraries.
House Bill 273, if signed by Ayotte, would require public libraries to make children’s borrowing histories available to their parents or legal guardians upon request. Under current state law, all library records are confidential outside of subpoenas, court orders, and the like. This bill would carve out an exception to that. 
Before Thursday’s vote, Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican, called the bill “another chapter in the continuing saga of protecting parental rights” and said it “is another chapter to complete, or almost complete, the circle” created when the Legislature passed — and Ayotte signed into law — House Bill 10.
HB 10, dubbed the Parental Bill of Rights, guarantees New Hampshire parents the right to ask school personnel for any information about what their child is doing at school and get complete disclosure. This sparked criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, who were concerned teachers would be forced to out young gay or trans kids. The bill also reaffirms parents’ right to opt their children out of sex education classes, exempt them from vaccine requirements with a doctor’s note or because of religious belief, and home school them, among other things. Much of what is contained in HB 10 was already allowed, but the new law enshrined it into state law. Finally, the bill also required school boards to create new policies promoting parental involvement in their children’s education.
Many Democrats opposed the bill, however, including Rep. Paul Berch, a Westmoreland Democrat. Birch cited the bill’s lack of specificity about how a library would verify that someone is in fact a child’s parent.
“Why are we going to turn over private records without any verification,” he asked on the House floor.
A committee of conference last week simply had to agree on an effective date. Both parties quickly agreed on Jan. 1.
School buildings and migrant shelters
Both the House and Senate accepted a bill to prevent school buildings from being used as migrant shelters Thursday — after an unrelated provision regarding local property valuation was added to the bill.
House Bill 71, if signed by the governor, will forbid New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from housing immigrants. Any school in violation would lose state funding. The legislation makes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or snowstorms.
However, when the Senate considered the bill, it added requirements for municipalities changing property valuations. The new provision seeks to require towns and cities with 10,000 or more people to publicize a change to a property valuation in a newspaper, online, and social media.
The bill was passed over the opposition of some Democrats. Rep. Muriel Hall, a Bow Democrat, said on the House floor Thursday that the legislation “infringes on local governments’ ability to effectively govern and make decisions about their own facilities, which could be empty for periods of time.”
Tilton Republican Rep. Lisa Freeman dismissed those concerns, saying “there’s a carve-out for states of emergency” in the legislation.
Voting bills sail through
The House and Senate passed a handful of bills designed to create stricter scrutiny of absentee ballots, amid a general push by Republicans to introduce more voter verification measures at the polls. 
Senate Bill 218 would require that those registering to vote as an absentee include documentary proof of citizenship, age, domicile, and identity with their registration form. The bill requires that that person registering sign an affidavit attesting to each of those qualifications under penalty of voter fraud, and it also requires a witness to sign an affidavit stating that they observed the registrant sign the application form and that the registrant “satisfied” the witness regarding their identity. 
Senate Bill 287 necessitates that people applying for absentee ballots include a copy of their identification as well as a signature from a licensed notary in order to obtain the ballot by mail. The applicant would not need a notarized signature if they appeared before their town or city clerk to apply for the absentee ballot ahead of the election.
Republican supporters say the bills would close off opportunities for voter fraud via the absentee ballot system. Voting rights groups countered that the bills would create high hurdles on voters with disabilities.
The Legislature on Thursday also passed a bill, House Bill 67, to require cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines in local elections — such as municipal elections and annual town meetings — and to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State’s Office to share those machines. Under the bill, municipalities would be required to pay the costs to program the machines for their ballots.
But lawmakers also passed House Bill 613, which allows a town or city to not provide accessible voting machines provided they posted an announcement at least three months before the election asking voters to request the machines be available in writing. If no voter did so at least 60 days before the election, the municipality would not need to provide the machine, HB 613 states.
And finally, the House and Senate passed Senate Bill 221, which requires supervisors of the checklist to conduct an annual, comprehensive review of their lists of registered voters and to purge any voters that should not be on the list. Currently that review is required only once every 10 years, though election officials update voter rolls as they receive death notices. 
Lawmakers approve end-of-lease bill
Lawmakers passed a bill allowing landlords to terminate a tenancy at the end of the lease period with no “good cause” needed, which Republicans say is necessary to protect the sanctity of the contract.
House Bill 60 would apply to leases 12 months in length or longer, and would allow a landlord to stop renting to a tenant at the end of the lease period with no reason given as long as the landlord has given 60 days of notice. 
The legislation does not allow discriminatory evictions and states that the current anti-retaliation laws are still in place. 
But tenants’ rights advocates have criticized the legislation, which they say could still make it easier for landlords to discriminate against tenants without easy consequences, and which they argue will increase evictions and homelessness.
Republicans say allowing an easier means for landlords to end a lease means they will be more likely to take chances on tenants with poor credit scores or evictions on their record, knowing they can end the contract if it does not work out.
The final version of the bill exempts any “no cause” termination of tenancy from appearing as an eviction on the tenant’s record, addressing some concerns.
Mandatory minimums and shrooms
One bill that didn’t get approval from both chambers Thursday was Senate Bill 14.
That bill sought to impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted on fentanyl charges in New Hampshire. The bill would’ve required judges to sentence those convicted with 20 grams or more of the drug to at least 3½ years in prison, and those convicted with 50 or more grams would be sentenced to no less than seven years. Currently, there’s no minimum sentence for fentanyl charges under state law, meaning judges have more discretion. However, there is a maximum of 30 years for first-time offenders and life imprisonment for repeat offenders.
The bill, though, contained more than fentanyl sentencing. After the Senate passed it, Republican Reps. Kevin Verville and Terry Roy added a new provision to lessen criminal penalties for psilocybin, the psychedelic drug colloquially known as shrooms or magic mushrooms. The new amendment would’ve turned possession or use of less than three-quarters of an ounce of psilocybin from a felony into a misdemeanor on first offense. Verville, who has championed other bills meant to reduce punishments for certain drugs like psilocybin or marijuana, has argued psilocybin is much less dangerous than fentanyl and that it has medicinal benefits, such as treatment for PTSD and migraines.
Thursday morning, the House initially voted 183-186 to reject the compromise version of the bill. However, after a midday recess, the House regrouped and brought the bill back for reconsideration and on a second vote approved it, 185-182.
“Never stop the drive until you score,” Rep. Jason Osborne, House majority leader and a proponent of the bill, wrote on social media following the second vote.
However, the bill’s newfound hope subsequently died when the Senate considered it. The Senate voted to table it at the request of Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican. Gannon had previously told House negotiators in the committee of conference that the psilocybin add-on was a nonstarter for the Senate. However, he was soon replaced on the committee by Sen. Daryl Abbas, a Salem Republican and vocal backer of mandatory minimums. The committee then approved a compromise deal with both the mandatory minimums and reduced psilocybin penalties. However, Gannon rallied enough Republicans to join with Democrats and shoot down the bill Thursday.
Enacting mandatory minimums was a legislative priority for Ayotte, who made it a campaign promise and has been publicly calling on lawmakers to get a bill across the finish line.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/campaignpromises-1024x554.jpg,,,2025-06-30 05:05:48.216339

In recent years, North Carolina Republican lawmakers have perfected the practice of rigging elections through partisan gerrymandering.
The situation has gotten so bad that they don’t even pretend anymore. They not only openly rig districts to disenfranchise voters who don’t vote Republican, they openly admit and brag about it.
And now, in a bill rammed through a House committee last week in record time, they’re bringing the same approach to election laws and the people who administer them.
Under a bill unveiled last week right before lawmakers commenced a summer break, the staff of the state Board of Elections – a group that’s always been scrupulously nonpartisan – would be transformed so that more than a third of existing staff positions would be converted to political appointees selected only by Republicans.
The bill includes other objectionable provisions too, including one that, –I’m not making this up– prevents local election boards from encouraging people to vote.
The bottom line: Election rigging through gerrymandering in our state is already scandalous. The new proposal is simply a travesty.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Changes will be made to the way abortions are reported in Ohio, according to the state operating budget the legislature passed last week. Meanwhile, infant and maternal funding are seeing reductions compared to previous versions of the budget.
Also, millions were set aside to provide ultrasound equipment specifically for entities that do not inform patients about abortion procedures and services as an option.
The Ohio General Assembly passed the state operating budget bill out of a joint conference committee last week, sending the bill to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature, and possible line-item vetoes of his choosing.
The budget included language making changes to the Ohio Department of Health’s annual abortion report, and established a new monthly report as part of the changes. A “public electronic dashboard” will also be published monthly, according to budget documents.
Data collection for both the annual and monthly reports would now include the total number of Ohio residents versus non-Ohio residents who have “undergone an abortion and received post-abortion care,” according to the budget. Physicians are required to fill out reports on both surgical and medication abortions, which Jaime Miracle, deputy director of advocacy group Abortion Forward, said just adds to the bureaucracy that bogs down proper medical care.
“No one wants to wait longer to see a doctor because they’re busy completing extra paperwork to satisfy some politician’s agenda,” Miracle said. “Ohio already has some of the most medically unnecessary and burdensome reporting requirements around abortion care. No other medical procedure is required to be reported in the way abortion is.”

Those reports would get information on the patient down to the ZIP code of the pregnant individual, something pro-abortion rights advocates have said is a privacy issue.
“Sharing ZIP code level data is a threat to patient data and privacy and has no business being in the state budget,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
Age categories would be altered under the budget bill, moving categories to younger than 16, 16 to 17 and 18 to 24.
The total of number of minors who received abortions will be included in the monthly and annual reports, separated out by the facility who performed the abortion. The number of abortions a patient has received and the total number of in-state versus out-of-state patients will also be broken down by age.
The deadline for the reports was also moved up by legislators. The public report will now be issued March 1 rather than Oct. 1.
  Separate provisions 
In other abortion-related budget provisions, the conference committee kept a provision from DeWine’s executive proposal that requires the Ohio Department of Health’s Genetic Services fund to be used for newborn screenings and genetic disease programs, but prohibited the use of the funds for abortion counseling or referral, “except in the case of a medical emergency.”
While the conference committee kept the overall provision, including the prohibition, it removed the exception for medical emergencies.
Kept intact was a Senate provision that gives $5 over the biennium to the Ohio Department of Children and Youth for the purchase of “3D diagnostic ultrasound machines,” to be distributed through a grant program.
The budget specifies, however, that the entities who are eligible to receive the ultrasound machines are those who do not “promote abortion, perform abortion-related medical procedures or make referrals for abortions.”
This could go to so-called pregnancy resource centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, which are typically religiously based and center their information and services on promoting pregnancy and discouraging abortion. The state – and DeWine through executive orders – has funded the centers with grant programs in the Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which has clear exceptions for those who provide abortion services or information.
The new budget even includes up to $750 per year in personal income tax deductions for those who donate to the centers, which could cost the state about $900,000 per year, according to budget documents.
Reproductive rights advocates have said not only do the anti-abortion measures pushed by the legislature negatively impact the state’s already low-ranking maternal and infant mortality rate, but the attention and money spent on anti-abortion measures take away from improvements that could be made.
The total appropriation for the “infant vitality” budget line went down from $20 million in the Ohio House proposal to $18 million in the conference committee-approved document. That number is a slight jump from the $16.8 million the state estimates for the fund in the current fiscal year.
Legislators gave $5 million to “programming by community and local faith-based service providers that invest in maternal health programs” and provide services to support pregnant mothers. But that number dropped in the budget process, from $7.5 million in the governor’s proposal and $6 million in the House proposal.
The final budget document removed a provision to use up to $1 million for non-medical services at residential infant care centers.
A provision to fund research looking into “causes, diagnoses, prevention and treatment” of pediatric cancer stayed cut in half from DeWine’s proposal, with the conference committee sticking to the House’s $5 million for fiscal year 2026, rather than the $10 million the governor had proposed.
$1.6 million was cut from funding for community projects that support “families, assisting families in avoiding crisis, and crisis intervention.”
The conference committee budget did include $5 million in each fiscal year from a Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, to be used to implement grant activities in “prenatal, maternal, perinatal and infant domains.”
A mental health block grant was also funded with $1.7 million each fiscal year for infant and early childhood mental health activities, and $6 million each year in funds from tobacco use prevention, cessation and enforcement would be used for awards, prioritizing “entities that serve women who reside in communities that have the highest infant mortality rates.”

Utah and other states have pushed the federal government to hand over public lands, and a sweeping proposal in Congress could put millions of acres up for sale. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ mega tax and spending bill, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Administration guidance around a lesser-known 1980s-era federal law regarding emergency abortion care has been rescinded by President Donald Trump’s administration, and could impact emergency room patients in Ohio.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted in 1986, with the aim to give peace of mind to patients entering emergency departments by making it law that patients must be treated and stabilized, or transferred to a hospital that can, regardless of income or insurance level. Hospitals risk Medicare and Medicaid funding if they don’t follow the law.
  Ohio hospitals 
The assurances held in the act include abortion services and care in the event of an emergency, which is why, when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, guidance was released by the U.S. Health and Human Services leader on how to continue under the federal law.
The letter from former Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized the protections in the act around “clinical judgment” and the the legal duty for physicians or other providers to “provide stabilizing medical treatment” to an emergency room patient above any “directly conflicting” state law.
“Thus, if a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department, including certain labor and delivery departments, is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment,” Becerra wrote.
Earlier this month, however, the Trump administration rescinded the guidance, along with Becerra’s letter explaining it, saying the documents “do not reflect the policy of this administration.”
A statement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said the federal law would still be enforced, despite the removal of guidance.
But Jessie Hill, professor and director of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University, said the action by the Trump administration will have impacts in states were abortion isn’t legal or is more restricted, and it “creates confusion for physicians who want to provide abortions in emergency situations because it’s not longer clear whether EMTALA permits that.”
“That said, even in states like Ohio where abortion is protected, it could have some effect,” Hill said. “In particular some hospitals – especially Catholic hospitals – will decline to provide emergency abortions except in the most extreme circumstances. This would be forbidden by the prior administration’s interpretation of EMTALA, but may be permitted by the current one.”
Local hospitals contacted by the Capital Journal said they are adhering to laws and providing care accordingly. Ohio also has a constitutional amendment that includes abortion care as one of the rights held in the state’s founding document.
“In terms of EMTALA, our legal landscape has been stable in Ohio,” a spokesperson for University Hospitals said. “Our approach at University Hospitals has not changed, and we provide appropriate clinical care.”
OhioHealth representatives said the system “will continue to offer care to our patients within the confines of any new regulatory landscape and always within the best practice standards of care.”
“If termination is medically necessary, OhioHealth health care professionals will take all measures to ensure the safety of the mother’s life, baby’s life or both,” a statement read.
The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center said it follows both state and federal laws, noting state law that restricts “abortions done in state institutions to those that are necessary for life-threatening maternal health conditions and pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, which have been reported to police,” according to spokesperson Marti Leitch.
A request for comment from Mount Carmel Health System was not returned as of Thursday.
  ‘Real-life effect’ 
The federal law further entered the national conversation via an Idaho court case that ended up rising to the U.S. Supreme Court last year.
U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear Idaho case on emergency room abortions

The nation’s highest court, however, didn’t rule on the merits of the federal law, instead sending the case back to a lower court for further litigation. Because of that, a lower court ruling was allowed to continue, temporarily allowing abortions in emergency situations.
But it was the story of Ohioan Brittany Watts’ treatment that spurred U.S. House Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, to fight to reinforce the rights under EMTALA.
“What was important for me was to highlight the real-life effect of what happens when there is confusion and uncertainty around the law,” Sykes told the Capital Journal, “that this does not become commonplace where women are seeking health care thinking they can’t receive it.”
Watts was criminally charged after suffering a miscarriage at home, accused of abuse of a corpse. Watts had gone to St. Joseph Warren Hospital and was diagnosed with a condition that “endangered her pregnancy.” But after waiting for hours, she left and came back the next day. She waited several more hours, then returned home, where the miscarriage occurred, according to her attorneys.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A grand jury declined to return an indictment, and Watts has since sued the city of Warren, law enforcement officers and the hospital, claiming constitutional violations and violations of EMTALA.
The resolution introduced by Sykes and New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill looks to “reaffirm” that the emergency medical law protects access to emergency abortion care in every state.
Sykes acknowledged the uphill battle her resolution faces toward passage with Republican majority in the U.S. House and “a pretty dysfunctional Congress that does not particularly lend itself to the health care of women and the health care of people.”
In the language of the resolution, the sponsors say bans and restrictions on reproductive health care “put the health and lives of pregnant people at risk.”
They say state laws with bans or restrictions in emergency circumstances that “force medical providers to decide between withholding necessary, stabilizing medical care from a patient experiencing a medical emergency or face criminal prosecution” also risk the health of pregnant individuals.
Sykes said the importance of upholding the federal law is even more important now, with a budget reconciliation bill that could reduce Medicaid funding and Affordable Care Act subsidies, causing the loss of health insurance for “millions of people” and forcing hospitals to have to deal with uncompensated care, according to Sykes.
“If this program is cut in the way Republicans want … I am concerned about the ripple effects of what happens to all of the people in this country and their ability to pay … when they show up in the emergency department,” Sykes said.
Right now, the discussion is about emergency abortion care, but in the future, it could be car accidents or heart attacks, Sykes argued.
The concern about access and confusion on available care is shared by reproductive health advocates and researchers who say EMTALA not only helps patients, but also the physicians who are just trying to do their jobs.
“In places where we are seeing contestations and the creation of exceptions for EMTALA, that’s going to be a distraction for clinicians if they have to stop and check if the legal status is at odds with the standards that are laid out in the care,” said Danielle Bessett, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and co-principal investigator at the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, which focuses on abortion and contraception policies.
While abortion-related visits are generally uncommon, with research showing post-abortion ER visits are typically “for reassurance,” Bessett said the information individuals receive should be dependably accurate and complete.
Confusion of any kind when it comes to health care, particularly when it comes to emergency situations will be “to the detriment of our societal health,” and that includes confusion among lawmakers making policies with direct impact in the sector, according to Bessett.
“It really goes back to the post-Dobbs restrictions that we’ve seen,” she said, referring to legislation in states after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. “They have an impact that goes beyond what lawmakers expected, because abortion is part of routine health care.”

(Getty Images)Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

“I am a doctor. I’m definitely not a politician, but I have been a lifelong public servant,” Acton said last week during a forum at the City Club of Cleveland.
“I’m running for governor because people in Ohio are struggling, and we continue to go backwards on nearly every measure because of special interests and bad actors at our Statehouse who keep taking us in the wrong direction,” she said. “It is time for a change, and I hear this everywhere I go.”
Acton gave a 30 minute speech which included talking about experiencing homelessness as a child, serving as the ODH director during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ohio’s need for change, and kindness. 
“All too often, kindness is mistaken for weakness, and that is a big mistake,” she said. “Everywhere I go, people are telling me that they want public servants again. They want us solving the problems of everyday life that we all face that aren’t political.” 
Those problems, she said, include the cost of living, aging in place, child care, safety, and schools. She also spoke out against gerrymandering, lack of maternity units in hospitals, and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. She also highlighted the importance of working together to tackle issues facing Ohioans. 
“You get people from every sector around the table because the wicked hard things we face, like housing affordability, can’t be solved by one area alone,” she said. “It can’t be solved by government alone. It takes non-profits and academics and universities and businesses all around the table trying to row in the same direction.” 
Acton, who is open about the struggles she experienced as a child, grew up in Youngstown. 
“I had a very, very rough childhood, very bad abuse and neglect up to the age of 12 (and) ultimately ended up homeless in the middle of winter,” she said.  
COVID-19 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Acton to be ODH director in 2019 and she quickly became a household name in Ohio during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. She accompanied DeWine during his daily afternoon press conferences in the spring of 2020 and helped translate complex medical terminology into plain English.  
“It was a profound honor to lead during COVID,” she said. “We literally flatten the curve. There’s great data now that shows it, and Ohioans rallied in every possible way. We saved a lot of lives, but most importantly, we’re also able to open earlier than a lot of places and get back to our lives because we took decisive action.” 
She received a mix of praise and criticism, and protesters showed up to her Bexley house. Acton resigned as state health director in June 2020 — months after Ohio’s first confirmed COVID-19 case. 
She said she didn’t step down because of the backlash she was receiving, but instead it was because she refused to sign an order.
“There was an order that was so egregious I could not do it … because it would have broken the Hippocratic Oath, it would have hurt people,” she said. “I could not sign my name to that order.” 
Acton said she was originally approached to run for office by two prominent Ohio Democrats — former Ohio Gov. Dick Celeste and former U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, “because I have a very strange constituency that does not know party, a bond formed during COVID.”  
Ohio Governor Race
Democrats are waiting to see if Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all. Currently, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe, of Columbus, is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026. 
The Ohio Republican Party endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill is the only other GOP candidate running for governor, but Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel previously said he is considering running. 
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026. 
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

But its safety-net cuts will cost Ohio and other states far more than it will save, according to a report published last week.
The deep cuts to health care under Medicaid, and to food support under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, wouldn’t only harm the most vulnerable, the report by the Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University says. It also would wipe out jobs, stifle state economies and diminish the tax revenue that state and local governments need to operate. 
The bill, which faces a Republican self-imposed July 4 deadline for passage, stands to destroy 1.2 million jobs in the United States by 2029 and shrink state economies by $154 billion, the analysis says. 
Proposed SNAP changes could swamp Ohio’s overburdened system

Some Ohio leaders have said that the changes proposed for SNAP would overwhelm an already overburdened system and increase hunger among children, the elderly, the disabled and the working poor. They say the Medicaid cuts would cost 770,000 mostly working Ohioans their health coverage.
The Commonwealth Foundation-George Washington University report says the bill’s blast radius is far wider than that.
Ohio would lose $4.5 billion in federal funding, it says. The state’s GDP, or economic output, would drop by $5.2 billion. State and local tax revenues would drop by $3.66 billion by 2029 as well, it said.
Ohio job losses, roughly half of them in the health sector, would be 44,700, or 0.8% of the workforce, it added.
Trump and congressional Republicans are justifying the cuts because they would shrink federal spending on Medicaid and SNAP by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. But that doesn’t take into account the direct and indirect harm that would be done to the broader economy.

“Our study reveals another, less discussed consequence of the budget cutbacks: the damage to state economies and loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, amounts that greatly exceed any federal savings,” the Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University report says. “More than a million people will lose their jobs, particularly in the health care sector. Hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes will close, many of them in rural and low-income communities. The need to compensate for the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding will mean that state and local governments will have to consider cuts in other public services, such as education or infrastructure, just as they lose billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue because of the economic dislocation these policies cause.”
Meanwhile, the economic justification for Trump’s proposed tax cuts is dubious. 
They’re titled heavily in favor of the richest Americans. Of the $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
The Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University analysis said that the cuts under the Republican bill would suck money out of the pockets of poor families while it stuffs it into those of the rich — and as it plunges all of us deeper into debt.
“By cutting safety-net programs, the House budget bill reduces resources for low-income households (the lowest 10% of earners) by an average of $1,600,” it said. “At the same time, the bill’s tax cuts increase resources for high-income households (the highest 10% of earners) by $12,000. Despite the spending cuts, the bill would increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion, including about $500 billion in higher interest costs.”
Tax cuts for the wealthy have long been sold on promises that they’ll juice the economy and everybody will benefit. But there’s little evidence to support that. 
For example, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 weren’t even half the size of those contemplated under The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Even so, they added $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the deficit, the Tax Policy Center estimates.
Trump claimed the corporate tax cuts that were part of the package would add $4,000 to median household income. But it was found to add nothing at all for families making $114,000 a year or less, while it led to vast increases in executive salaries, the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities reported.

(Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)On Saturday, June 7, I walked through South Park in Lawrence with my husband. We were browsing booths set up to for the annual LGBTQ+ pride celebration.
There had been a parade to start the day’s festivities, a parade we didn’t attend because it was pouring rain. But the skies soon cleared, and despite swampy patches in the grass and puddles on the concrete, the pride persisted. Hundreds of people circulated through the park, wearing an array of rainbow garb and chatting among themselves. A stage set up in the street played queer-themed hits such as Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club.”
The crowd was a portrait of diversity — old people, young people, middle-aged people, of all colors and races, of different levels of physical ability. I saw parents with children, couples, extended families and individuals, all part of a giant toast to equality. As we browsed among the crowd, I couldn’t help but think how different this was from current narratives about gay rights.

“How the Gay Rights Movement Radicalized, and Lost Its Way,” New York Times, June 26.
“Supreme Court OKs Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for kids, a setback for transgender rights,” Associated Press, June 18.
“Hegseth directs renaming of Navy ship honoring LGBT icon Harvey Milk,” Washington Post, June 27

Headlines paint a movement on the retreat. But I didn’t see that in Lawrence. Instead, a saw a movement growing up, expanding its reach and readying itself for battles ahead.

I won’t deny that I wiped aside a few tears.
Liberty and justice for all might go in and out of fashion. But equality remains essential if you care about other human beings in both Kansas and the entire United States. So many people had dedicated their lifetimes to getting where we were that June 7. And many more will dedicate their lifetimes to making sure that we go on celebrating, no matter what.

What’s practical
In general, I believe that politics and policy should engage more with the practical and possible than the idealistic.
If two sides appear irreparably divided, participants should figure out what small things they agree on, rather then focusing on their most yawning divides.
For the overwhelming majority of public policy issues, this makes good sense. If your opponents want a lower tax rate, and you want taxes at a higher rate, you can you can compromise on a tax rate somewhere in the middle. If you want government to spend more on one kind of service and your opponents want it to spend less, you set spending in between those proposals.
We’ve watched Republican senators engage in just this kind of horse trading on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” over the weekend. When people say that lawmakers should work together, they usually mean something like this. Find compromise. Move forward.
But when it comes to equality, this approach becomes much more difficult.
There’s no middle ground between saying that one group of people has the same rights as you and saying that they don’t have those rights and should be ashamed of asking. Compromising on full equality means denying it. You can’t be partly equal, or as the shameful U.S. Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson put it, separate but equal.
Compromise can still improve the lives of marginalized groups. Half measures can increase the range of rights and privileges enjoyed by one kind of people or another. For instance, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — or DACA — transformed the lives of immigrants brought into the United States as children. It did not grant them full citizenship, but the program didn’t harm them.
Still, compromise can grate on the march toward full equality. Civil unions did not last long as a compromise measure for same-sex couples. Both they and many straight people decided that expanding the definition of marriage to include gay people actually strengthened the institution. It was, and remains, win-win.
As the headlines above suggest, the LGBTQ+ community has recently experienced backlash. I had hoped that we might avoid this, but oppressors don’t like to see their carefully assembled basket of privileges overturned. They will fight wildly to retain their imagined superiority.
But it is only imagined.
No amount of racist rhetoric, homophobic grumbling or ultraconservative legislatures can change the fact that discrimination is wrong. Treating people differently because of innate traits cannot be defended. It will always be wrong. And those who seek to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people or Black people or Jewish people or people of color or any other group you care to name will always be mistaken. They will find themselves on the ash heap of history.

Pushing forward
This basic moral truth is why social movements continue.
This is why gay people and their allies flood the streets for pride marches — not just in Lawrence but also in Budapest, Hungary. This is why Black people and their friends and supporters mark Juneteenth. Those of us who know what it’s like to face institutionalized legal discrimination do not forget.
I am perfectly capable of holding a polite conversation with someone who believes that I am less than a full human being. But I know the harms their beliefs have caused. I will still judge them.
Those on the far right like to accuse anyone to their left of moral relativism. Yet I cannot imagine a more morally objective, idealistic goal than full legal equality for all people. When it comes to individual rights, when it comes to the freedom of people to be who they truly are, we can share a noble goal.
As a gay man, I’ve been stunned to see how far America has moved during my lifetime. I now live with my husband and son in a state where being gay was actually illegal.
I have no illusions. The job’s not done, will probably never be done. We still have much ground to cover in gaining basic legal rights for LGBTQ+ people. 
Yet as we walked through that sodden-yet-heartening event in early June, I chose to focus on the positive for a few minutes. LGBTQ+ people will not give up, cannot give up, because this is who we are. These are our lives, and we are just as worthy, just as American, just as human, as anyone else. Happy pride to all.

Over the past decade, health insurance companies have increasingly embraced the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. Unlike doctors and hospitals, which use AI to help diagnose and treat patients, health insurers use these algorithms to decide whether to pay for health care treatments and services that are recommended by a given patient’s physicians.
One of the most common examples is prior authorization, which is when your doctor needs to
receive payment approval from your insurance company before providing you care. Many insurers use an algorithm to decide whether the requested care is “medically necessary” and should be covered.
These AI systems also help insurers decide how much care a patient is entitled to — for example, how many days of hospital care a patient can receive after surgery.
If an insurer declines to pay for a treatment your doctor recommends, you usually have three options. You can try to appeal the decision, but that process can take a lot of time, money and expert help. Only 1 in 500 claim denials are appealed. You can agree to a different treatment that your insurer will cover. Or you can pay for the recommended treatment yourself, which is often not realistic because of high health care costs.
As a legal scholar who studies health law and policy, I’m concerned about how insurance algorithms affect people’s health. Like with AI algorithms used by doctors and hospitals, these tools can potentially improve care and reduce costs. Insurers say that AI helps them make quick, safe decisions about what care is necessary and avoids wasteful or harmful treatments.
But there’s strong evidence that the opposite can be true. These systems are sometimes used to delay or deny care that should be covered, all in the name of saving money.
 A pattern of withholding care

Presumably, companies feed a patient’s health care records and other relevant information into health care coverage algorithms and compare that information with current medical standards of care to decide whether to cover the patient’s claim. However, insurers have refused to disclose how these algorithms work in making such decisions, so it is impossible to say exactly how they operate in practice.
Using AI to review coverage saves insurers time and resources, especially because it means fewer medical professionals are needed to review each case. But the financial benefit to insurers doesn’t stop there. If an AI system quickly denies a valid claim, and the patient appeals, that appeal process can take years. If the patient is seriously ill and expected to die soon, the insurance company might save money simply by dragging out the process in the hope that the patient dies before the case is resolved.
This creates the disturbing possibility that insurers might use algorithms to withhold care for expensive, long-term or terminal health problems , such as chronic or other debilitating disabilities. One reporter put it bluntly: “Many older adults who spent their lives paying into Medicare now face amputation or cancer and are forced to either pay for care themselves or go without.”
Research supports this concern – patients with chronic illnesses are more likely to be denied coverage and suffer as a result. In addition, Black and Hispanic people and those of other nonwhite ethnicities, as well as people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, are more likely to experience claims denials. Some evidence also suggests that prior authorization may increase rather than decrease health care system costs.
Insurers argue that patients can always pay for any treatment themselves, so they’re not really being denied care. But this argument ignores reality. These decisions have serious health consequences, especially when people can’t afford the care they need.
 Moving toward regulation

Unlike medical algorithms, insurance AI tools are largely unregulated. They don’t have to go through Food and Drug Administration review, and insurance companies often say their algorithms are trade secrets.
That means there’s no public information about how these tools make decisions, and there’s no outside testing to see whether they’re safe, fair or effective. No peer-reviewed studies exist to show how well they actually work in the real world.
There does seem to be some momentum for change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which is the federal agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, recently announced that insurers in Medicare Advantage plans must base decisions on the needs of individual patients – not just on generic criteria. But these rules still let insurers create their own decision-making standards, and they still don’t require any outside testing to prove their systems work before using them. Plus, federal rules can only regulate federal public health programs like Medicare. They do not apply to private insurers who do not provide federal health program coverage.
Some states, including Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Maine and Texas, have proposed laws to rein in insurance AI. A few have passed new laws, including a 2024 California statute that requires a licensed physician to supervise the use of insurance coverage algorithms.
But most state laws suffer from the same weaknesses as the new CMS rule. They leave too much control in the hands of insurers to decide how to define “medical necessity” and in what contexts to use algorithms for coverage decisions. They also don’t require those algorithms to be reviewed by neutral experts before use. And even strong state laws wouldn’t be enough, because states generally can’t regulate Medicare or insurers that operate outside their borders.
 A role for the FDA

In the view of many health law experts, the gap between insurers’ actions and patient needs has become so wide that regulating health care coverage algorithms is now imperative. As I argue in an essay to be published in the Indiana Law Journal, the FDA is well positioned to do so.
The FDA is staffed with medical experts who have the capability to evaluate insurance algorithms before they are used to make coverage decisions. The agency already reviews many medical AI tools for safety and effectiveness. FDA oversight would also provide a uniform, national regulatory scheme instead of a patchwork of rules across the country.
Some people argue that the FDA’s power here is limited. For the purposes of FDA regulation, a medical device is defined as an instrument “intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.” Because health insurance algorithms are not used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease, Congress may need to amend the definition of a medical device before the FDA can regulate those algorithms.
If the FDA’s current authority isn’t enough to cover insurance algorithms, Congress could change the law to give it that power. Meanwhile, CMS and state governments could require independent testing of these algorithms for safety, accuracy and fairness. That might also push insurers to support a single national standard – like FDA regulation – instead of facing a patchwork of rules across the country.
The move toward regulating how health insurers use AI in determining coverage has clearly begun, but it is still awaiting a robust push. Patients’ lives are literally on the line.

Nineteen states now have a law or policy banning transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity.
About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings. The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “common-sense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year. South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law earlier this year when it passed the state budget. The bathroom policy became law last year when it was inserted into part of the state budget, which must be renewed each year.
The Arizona legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

But what happens when our doodads and thingamajigs act human … you know … err?
To wit: Last week in this space, the modern marvel autocorrect changed one letter in one word (“defund” to “defend”) in one sentence, in one paragraph of an entire 750-word commentary. The “correction” altered the entire meaning of the piece. But those were simply the details.
More pressing appears to be that we’re moving from machines being able to help us express our thoughts and ideas to machines making them for us — intentional or not. All in the name of technological progress. 
Common wizardry
Such wizardry as autocorrect, ChatGPT or any of a number of AI tools is commonplace today, whether to construct a good declarative sentence or to plan and execute a bombing mission 7,000 miles away. I’m only speculating on the latter, but surely AI played some role when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Perhaps AI will also be used to resolve with accuracy the debate between “obliterate” and “two months,” a chasm both linguistic and political.
We can stop already with that annoying longing for the good old days. The AI genie is long out of the bottle and is not going back in. While government, business, medicine, manufacturing, agriculture and science race to capitalize on its wonders — which are legion and spectacular — we should also know and embrace its limitations. 
Please don’t confuse me with the Luddite down the block. I have for some time embraced technology, even making peace as a former professor of academic writing with the untimely death of the college essay at the impressive hands of large language learning models such as the aforementioned ChatGPT. 
You remember ChatGPT: Feed some information into it, such as “Write 600 words making the case for slavery reparations.” Click once and within 30 seconds, you have yourself a serviceable essay, probably in the realm of “Cs get degrees.” A second try might ask it to provide two citations. Which it will. (C+?) Try it. Perhaps you’ll want to retake Comp 101 from freshman year.
But, as I’ve written before, what is missing in these essays is a sense of humanity, not simply in language but also in tone, word choice and if you will, a measure of the writer’s passion for the subject — none of which, to date, ChatGPT can provide. A productive bot may be many things. A moral being is not one of them.
Our health can be affected, too. A critical reading of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” uncovered serious flaws, including citations of research that did not exist. Whether or not AI was used to generate the report remains unclear. This much is clear: It makes little difference whether it was the bots or the humans. The information was wrong. 
Often right
AI gets it right most of the time. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether most of the time is good enough. Is it better than a human most of the time? Worse? I’m intolerant of one incorrect word out of 750. What would be our tolerance level in war, surgery, a banking transaction or an immigration hearing?
These AI problems, called hallucinations, have led to PR disasters for American businesses from McDonald’s to Sports Illustrated to Amazon. Mickey D’s had to scuttle its foray into AI ordering when a video of the AI “crew member” ringing up an order of 260 Chicken McNuggets after the customers had begged it to stop went viral. SI somehow gave bylines to AI-generated authors, and Amazon was hyping a recruitment tool that somehow only recruited men.
Pardon my cherry picking. Regular readers here know that of all the modern barriers between us and a better future, access to the truth is paramount. AI can be a powerful force in that kit of democracy’s tools. AI and someone accountable for it.
Had last week’s autocorrect snafu gone unedited, the republic would have survived. But as we edge forward (or backward) with cease fires and bombings and the potential for a wider war, we should ensure all the AI and technological wizardry we have at our disposal has a capable human — a moral agent — attached.
To read more about AI and hallucinations, Google them. An AI bot will tell you all you need to know.

Two people have been killed and another is injured after firefighters in north Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
“The wounded firefighter’s condition wasn’t known,” the AP reported.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said at a Sunday afternoon press conference.
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.
However, the brush fire is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”

 Shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said at the Sunday afternoon press conference.
Norris said he believes that the two people killed were firefighters. The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at a press conference at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris said law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

FBI assets are headed to the scene in Coeur d’Alene to provide tactical and operational support.

 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.
An additional press conference is scheduled for 9:30 p.m. tonight, according to a Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office press release.

Ned Lamont sounded to be in complete denial about both the moment we are living in and just how disappointing his own decisions have been since Donald Trump took office.
It amazes me completely that after seeing historic primary turnout, engagement from new voters, and massive activation of young volunteers coming together to defeat a corrupt and scandal-ridden candidate who Lamont himself endorsed, Lamont’s tone is anything other than “it’s time to scrap the old playbook.” This complete inability to read the room is unacceptable given the moment we are in nationally, and we must demand more. 

Shontá Browdy
As a working-class mother in Hartford and a member of its board of education, I find that this administration is, at best, ignoring residents in my city and, at worst, outright hostile to us.
Our governor continues to vehemently defend our state’s irrationally strict fiscal guardrails, which have made it virtually impossible for my school district to even dream of someday having fully funded schools for our children.
On top of that, he remains the main barrier to our state being able to raise equitable tax revenue, meaning that the state budget remains balanced on the backs of working people rather than on billionaires. In what world does it make sense for you and me as workers to be responsible for paying for our state’s many needs while Connecticut’s wealthiest residents continue to coast on capital gains and inherited wealth? 
The governor’s recent vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure for unemployment insurance for striking workers, coupled with his threat of vetoing a bill that would have protected our immigrant neighbors from Trump’s ICE kidnappings, speak volumes. We’ve reached the point where we have to ask: “Can a governor of immense personal wealth genuinely be the voice fighting for working people in Connecticut?” 
Right now, we face relentless budget cuts from the federal government, paired with federal tax breaks for the same super-wealthy billionaires that our state refuses to tax locally. Meanwhile, in my role on the board of education, I witness the way our state’s austerity leads to a lack of resources, overcrowded classrooms, and missed opportunities for the very students who need the most support.
By remaining loyal to the illusion of “responsibility,” we are creating entire generations of students who will struggle and come to believe that their government does not give a damn about them. 
It’s time for our state’s leadership to truly listen to voices from places like Hartford, and to learn lessons from historic elections across the region. We need fiscal policies that are flexible, compassionate, and truly reflective of the significant needs of our residents in childcare, education, and healthcare.
We cannot afford a governor who is this out of touch; we need a leader who understands that true fiscal responsibility means investing in our people, our future, and especially, our children.

The vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down. This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership.
The post Mass. must resist Congress’s proposed moratorium on state AI regulation appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PRESIDENT TRUMP has demanded that Congress pass his “One Big Beautiful Bill” by July 4, putting enormous pressure on the House and Senate to move quickly.
The House version passed on May 22 gave tech industry lobbyists a massive victory tucked deep in the bill: a 10-year moratorium on state law regulating the development or deployment of AI. 
Since then, members of Congress, tech executives, researchers, and more have decried the potential harms of preempting states from constraining the potential dangers of AI for a decade—a lifetime for this rapidly accelerating technology. And yet the proposal is largely intact in the most recent Senate version of the bill, even though the vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down.
This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership on AI. As we have previously written, the state has taken action to support AI development with the new Massachusetts AI Hub. But global leadership isn’t just the propulsive development of new technology; it’s making sure that such innovation benefits, and does not harm, real people. Unfortunately, Massachusetts lags in lawmaking to protect citizens, consumers, kids, and workers from the harms of online platforms and AI.
Dozens of bills have been introduced in the Massachusetts Legislature to address a wide variety of potential AI harms. For example, S.264 would require companies to disclose when the online representative you’re talking to is not a human, and hold them accountable for statements made by their virtual agents. S.44 would prohibit misleading deepfakes shared before elections. S.994 would preclude landlords from using AI to collusively set rents. 
Beacon Hill should draw national focus to the threat of a federal AI regulation moratorium by immediately holding joint hearings, passing meaningful regulation on AI, and – as we do in other policy domains – fighting alongside other states in court for our laws and rights if the moratorium gets enacted.
Contrary to the AI industry’s assertions, regulating technology to protect people’s well-being actually creates pressure for better innovation. The Clean Air Act of 1970 didn’t just reduce air pollution but fundamentally transformed automotive technology, leading to computer-controlled engines, advanced materials science, and sophisticated emission control systems that are now standard worldwide. The Americans with Disabilities Act’s web requirements led to breakthrough innovations like voice search, predictive text, and flexible interfaces—features that benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.
The federal moratorium, if passed this summer, would have little direct impact on Massachusetts because we have yet to enact the kinds of protections Congress threatens to undermine. Some on Beacon Hill have publicly opposed the federal preemption of AI regulation. But the Commonwealth has not yet taken action to back up this rhetoric.
Other states, however, are actively legislating AI policy to protect their citizens. New York just passed comprehensive security and safety requirements for AI model developers. New Hampshire prohibits state agencies from using AI to surveil the public. Florida prohibits certain uses of deepfakes in political advertising. California requires disclosure when providers use AI to communicate with health care patients. Moreover, in the absence of federal action on digital technology and online platforms, other states have moved to restrict smartphones in schools, protect kids online, strengthen users’ control of their data, and enhance consumer privacy.
These laws are in their infancy, but their existence will enable us to learn what policies work best to govern and steer AI so that we can eventually scale them nationally to benefit all Americans. But the prohibition in the “Big Beautiful Bill” on state regulation of AI would destroy states’ vital role as policy labs exactly when we need them the most — as AI is poised to bring generational upheaval to our lives, our communities, and our society.
Throughout its history, Massachusetts exemplified the American tradition of US states as laboratories of democracy. It has been a national leader in policy innovation to protect people and improve their well-being. 
It was the first state to require kids to attend school, passed the nation’s first minimum wage law, and one of the first workers compensation laws, helping establish the modern system of workplace injury protection. More recently, the Commonwealth’s universal health care mandate became the model for the popular Affordable Care Act that has provided health insurance to more than 50 million Americans. 
Now, Massachusetts must meet the moment and lead in the digital age to protect its people from the harms of AI and steer this transformative technology in the public interest.

Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — President Donald Trump and Republican leadership in Congress are pushing a presidential-pressured deadline of July 4 to send a “big” tax and spending bill that Trump calls “beautiful” to the president’s desk. 
And once again, Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Republican, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote, after expressing concerns over Senate Republicans’ efforts to find more cuts to Medicaid in their version of the bill to offset the rising costs of the megabill. 
The bill would make the tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, boost funding for immigration enforcement, start funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplish other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda. The bill also cuts the social safety net, adding new requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.
Fight over details
The Trump tax bill has multiple provisions that several different groups of Republicans have issues with, which have caused Republican leadership on the Hill to try to wrangle Congress and House Republicans to be lockstep. 
Bacon told the Examiner in recent days that he had received assurances that the bill would not degrade the quality of healthcare for people covered by Medicaid. He also was part of a group of 16 House Republicans who said they won’t support the Senate’s reconciliation bill if it cuts the Medicaid provider tax rate 
“I love Senator Ricketts and Senator Fisher, but hearing, ‘We got to put our own fingerprints on the bill,’” Bacon said, “Well, please don’t do it on Medicaid, put your fingerprints on some other places.” 
After some hiccups with some parliamentary rulings, Senate Republicans appear to be on track to pass their version and send it back to the House later this week, in time for Trump’s deadline. Congressional experts have estimated that the package would add $3.253 trillion to the debt during the next decade, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Some Senate Republicans have proposed cutting more from Medicaid via an amendment that would reduce federal government spending on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of the Democrats’ 2010 health care law. 
Voters in Nebraska and a combination of voters and legislators in 40 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, have supported Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.

The House version introduces Medicaid’s new work requirement, shortening the enrollment period and eliminating what Republicans describe as “waste, fraud and abuse” in the system by adding more paperwork. 
The proposed change in the House version, also in the Senate bill, would require able-bodied people and working-aged individuals to show the government proof of employment to remain on the program every six months. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage due to the stricter requirements, which are expected to save the federal government $280 billion over six years.
Bacon said he can “defend that all day long.”
“We’re doing smart savings and protecting those who need it under the house plan,” Bacon said in an interview late last week. 
Senate-House squabble
Bacon said the Medicaid cuts that the Senate is proposing are undermining the strength of the GOP’s argument of going after “fraud and abuse” and also emphasized that he didn’t like specific provisions in the bill, such as those related to SNAP. 
For months, state lawmakers, left-leaning political advocacy organizations, medical professionals, activists and some everyday Nebraskans have expressed concerns about the “disastrous” consequences of the “one, big beautiful bill’s” Medicaid cuts for healthcare access and rural hospitals.

Angie Lauritsen, state director of the political advocacy group Nebraska For Us, said Bacon has sided “with the ultra-wealthy over the Nebraskans he was elected to serve” but said he could “redeem” himself. 
“Does he want to stand with the ultra-wealthy or will he finally put working families first?” Lauritsen said. 
Scrutiny of Bacon’s position on the bill could prove less effective after news broke that the retired Air Force brigadier general is not seeking reelection in 2026, causing political shockwaves as he represents one of the nation’s most competitive congressional districts.
Bacon has been pushing back on the Senate version of the bill, as both Nebraska senators — U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts do interviews on the importance of preserving Trump’s tax cuts. 
“We want to make sure [we] deliver on our promises to the American people,” Fischer said on Fox News. “We can’t see these tax cuts expire.” 
Few places have faced more political pushback to the bill than in swing districts like Nebraska’s 2nd District, with its slight GOP tilt.  A bipartisan group of state lawmakers in Nebraska expressed concerns in a letter to Nebraska’ U.S. senators over how the Trump Tax would impact SNAP. Republicans and Trump have pushed back on the framing of the reductions as cuts. They say they are targeting abuses.
At least one of the most recent Senate versions would require states to cover some of the costs of SNAP benefits, which are currently mostly funded by the federal government. Senate Republicans are also considering additional reductions to the program than the House version, which independent analysis shows would likely cut at least 3 million people from the program. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon will not seek reelection in Nebraska’s 2nd District

“Nebraska would be on the hook for approximately $16 million in benefit costs and an additional $12.1 million in administrative expenses to maintain program operations,” the letter from Nebraska lawmakers read. “These policy choice dynamics would put significant pressure on our state budget and may result in reduced benefits or more restrictive eligibility.”  
Still deciding
Bacon said he wouldn’t know how he would vote until the Senate had passed its amended version.
Bacon has emphasized that he has received concessions or reassurances from House leadership for his vote. As Bacon told the New York Times earlier this month — he “doesn’t like voting “no” but likes “fixing things.” He also told the national outlet that he was a “no” on advancing a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion that the federal government had already approved for international aid and public media funding — but flipped his vote after ‘reassurances’ of some funding for AIDS help and public media.
He also told the national outlet that he wouldn’t follow his party ‘off the cliff.’ Multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it. 
Former White House employee Elon Musk has criticized the legislation, saying “destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm” to the nation. He has been especially critical of how much it adds to the national deficit and debt. 
For Bacon, he said he liked the direction the Senate version was taking. 
“I’ve had a lot of media saying, Are you going to support the Senate’s version?” Bacon said. “I don’t … know.”

(Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)Two people have been killed after firefighters in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
The incident was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a social media post. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and other emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure the still-active scene.

Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho. This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. Teresa and I are heartbroken.
As this…
— Brad Little (@GovernorLittle) June 29, 2025

Norris said in a press conference Sunday evening that law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The brush fire is still burning, and Norris said that until the shooter is caught, emergency personnel cannot respond to it.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, that in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

FBI assets are headed to the scene in Coeur d’Alene to provide tactical and operational support.
It is an active scene.
— Dan Bongino (@FBIDDBongino) June 29, 2025

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race was already set to be one of the most closely watched elections in the country next year.
That attention reached new heights after U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who has held the seat since 2014, announced Sunday he would not seek another term.
“I still look forward to continuing to serve North Carolina over the next 18 months,” Tillis said in a statement. “I look forward to solely focusing on producing meaningful results without the distraction of raising money or campaigning for another election.”
North Carolina’s race will be crucial in a midterm cycle that will play key role in determining control of razor-thin majorities on Capitol Hill. While Republicans aim to hold the seat for another six years, Democrats are seeking to flip it and turn the state’s U.S. Senate delegation purple.
Multiple candidates have already made campaigns for the seat official. Now, with the incumbent stepping aside, North Carolinians can expect to see contested primary elections on both sides of the aisle.
The Cook Political Report, as of Sunday, rated the North Carolina race “lean Republican,” though that could change with news of Tillis’ retirement.
Here’s who has announced their intention to run for the seat; who’s taken their name out of the running; and who could still throw their hat in the ring.

Who’s running
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D) — Nickel was the first major candidate to enter the race. He served one term in the U.S. House before Republican-friendly redistricting spurred him to drop his re-election bid.
Nickel is a criminal defense attorney who previously served in the state Senate. He’s repeatedly tied Tillis to President Donald Trump, and has proposed that Democrats form a “shadow cabinet” to monitor and respond to the Trump administration.
He has just over half a million dollars on hand as of April, according to campaign finance filings.
“It doesn’t matter what MAGA Republican Trump handpicks for North Carolina,” Nickel wrote on social media Sunday. “I’m the Democrat running because WE CAN flip our great state blue and win back the Senate majority.”
Don Brown (R) — Brown, a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, author and attorney from Charlotte, provided aid to those who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. He has billed himself as “your America First candidate.”
He has done little fundraising thus far, raising just $21,600 as of April.
  Former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Who’s not running
Mark Robinson (R) — Robinson’s campaign for governor in 2024 was derailed by a series of controversies and scandals, and he came up well short against Gov. Josh Stein.
He said in January he “will not run” for the seat, and that he did not intend to seek elected office in the future.
But he has remained an active voice online, frequently blasting Tillis and calling on conservative activists to oust him and other Republicans he deems not satisfactory. And it remains a possibility, however remote, that he could reverse course in the wake of Tillis’ retirement — though he would face major opposition from national party leaders if he chose to do so.
Robinson’s former campaign spokesperson, Matt Hurley, wrote online Sunday that Tillis’ retirement “is the end of a terrible era in North Carolina politics.”
“A new era of grassroots leadership in North Carolina is coming… you can count on it,” Hurley wrote.
Robinson shared the post and chimed in: “I couldn’t have said it better.”
Who could run
Former Gov. Roy Cooper (D) — The former two-term governor is widely viewed as the most prominent and formidable potential Democratic candidate.
Cooper is a familiar name in Democratic politics — a former attorney general and state senator. His name recognition, fundraising and political connections would make him an instant favorite for the party’s nomination if he chooses to run.

However, he’s yet to make an official decision. In the meantime, Cooper has served as a teaching fellow at Harvard University’s public health school.
Since 1986, 48% of governors who ran for U.S. Senate seats have been elected, according to data from Ballotpedia. Democrats have won 16 of those races, lost 12, lost six in the primary and had one withdraw before the primary.
Lara Trump (R) — The president’s daughter-in-law has for years been floated as a possible North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate. Tillis’ retirement provides an opening for her to make a run official.
She’s married to the president’s son Eric, grew up in Wilmington, and attended undergrad at NC State University. Last year, she was elected co-chair of the RNC along with another North Carolina figure, Michael Whatley. She resigned from the post in December 2024, and currently hosts “My View with Lara Trump” on Fox News.

Trump’s strength as a candidate speaks for itself — sharing name recognition, connections and fundraising with the leader of the Republican Party and its most significant endorser.
But any rumors of her candidacy could once again be just that — as they were ahead of a North Carolina seat in 2022, and amid a Senate opening in Florida late last year. She stepped away from the field on both occasions.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson (D) — Jackson has run for the U.S. Senate before — he launched a campaign during the 2022 cycle, before later suspending his campaign and backing the eventual nominee, Cheri Beasley.
The open seat provides a path back to Capitol Hill for Jackson, who served a term in the U.S. House before winning the attorney general’s office last November.
But it remains to be seen whether he would choose to jump back into the political fray only a short time into his first term in the AG’s office, which has also been a stop for Cooper and Josh Stein before winning the governorship.

Jackson said Sunday he respected Tillis’ decision to end his tenure “when he felt the time was right,” and praised his vote against the Trump-backed budget mega-bill.
“I saw that he spoke about having the pure freedom to call balls and strikes over the next 18 months, and I genuinely look forward to that,” Jackson said. “It’s the approach that will serve North Carolina best and I’m glad to see that’s how he sees his mission with his remaining time in the Senate.”
Dan Bishop (R) — Bishop, a loyal Trump supporter, lost the state attorney general’s race to Jackson in November. Instead, the former congressman has remained in Washington — serving as deputy director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

He served two districts across three terms in the U.S. House. And during his prior stints in the North Carolina legislature, he authored the controversial “bathroom bill” restricting transgender people’s access to public restrooms.
Michael Whatley (R) — The head of Republicans’ national elections machine could jump into a race himself.
Whatley formerly served as chair of the North Carolina GOP before being elected chair of the Republican National Committee last year, a position in which he still serves.
The nonprofit news outlet NOTUS reported Sunday that Whatley was considering running for the seat, citing an unnamed source.

North Carolina’s U.S. House delegation (D & R) –Any of the state’s 14-member House delegation could aim to make the jump to the higher chamber.
Four of them are Democrats — including U.S. Rep. Don Davis, who represents one of the most closely contested districts in the country. U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, Valerie Foushee and Alma Adams are also multiple terms into their House tenure. Ross was the Democratic Senate nominee in 2016, losing to then-incumbent Republican, Richard Burr.
Of the 10 Republicans, U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx is the most senior, having served since 2005. But if Foxx were to run, she’d be sacrificing significant power as the chair of the Rules committee. And she is one of the 10 oldest members of Congress, having turned 82 on Sunday.

Another possibility is U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the campaign arm for House Republicans. NOTUS also reported the possibility of a Hudson campaign Sunday.
Spectrum News reported Sunday that U.S. Reps. Greg Murphy, Pat Harrigan and Tim Moore are also considering campaigns.
North Carolina’s legislative leaders (D & R) — The most prominent legislators on Jones Street could aim to make the jump to Washington.
Among them are Republicans Phil Berger, 72, who has been Senate leader for more than a decade, and Destin Hall, 37, the newly-ascended Speaker of the House.
The Democrats’ caucus heads are House leader Robert Reives, 54, and new Senate leader Sydney Batch, 46.
Other state lawmakers besides those in leadership could also seek to launch campaigns.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2217838562-594x594-Tillis.jpg,,,2025-06-29 17:01:29.140731

So this change would prevent Medicaid patients, who may have few other options, from using Planned Parenthood for other types of health care, like annual physicals, contraception and cancer screenings.A prior version of the bill blocked federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood for the next decade.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about how the rulings might impact the bill going forward.Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement the latest rulings show ""that Republican attempts to give away goodies that benefit certain states will not pass muster under Senate rules.""“Senate Democrats have also successfully challenged a giveaway to Big Pharma, as well as policies that make it harder for seniors and kids to get affordable health care through Medicaid,"" Wyden wrote. ""Republicans wanted to bring back the health care tactics of yesteryear, like waiting periods, lock-outs and annual limits on care, but Democrats have wrestled these out of the bill. I am disappointed that the Republican rewrite of the provider tax changes will remain in the bill: this policy will force states into devastating cuts to health care that seniors, kids and Americans with disabilities depend on.

Free.,"US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-launches-debate-gop-mega-bill-passage-still-not-assured,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate began floor debate on Republicans' “big, beautiful bill” Sunday afternoon, though there are several steps to go before the legislation can become law, and any one of those could lead to additional GOP opposition — potentially dooming the measure. Senators must wrap up an ongoing review of the bill with the parliamentarian to ensure it meets the strict rules for using the reconciliation process and then run the gauntlet during a marathon amendment voting session.Additional changes to the sweeping tax and spending cuts package, some of which were being worked on as debate took place, need to garner the support of nearly every Republican in Congress. Otherwise, it will never become law.Senate Majority Leader John Thune signaled during a brief hallway interview there may be enough votes for a new twist in the Medicaid changes in the bill — an amendment reducing in some way how much the federal government spends on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of Democrats’ 2010 health care law. The federal government currently pays 90% of the costs for enrollees in the expansion.“We're going to do what we can to support the effort,” Thune said, referring to an amendment offered by Florida Sen. Rick Scott that was not yet public. “It's great policy and something that there's a high level of interest in our conference in getting made part of the bill, and obviously scores a substantial savings.""But Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped a question about whether making that change would create vote-count issues if Republicans in the House with affected districts object, potentially preventing the bill from reaching President Donald Trump’s desk.“We have had some of these conversations with (Speaker Mike Johnson) and others over there, and then also with our colleagues for some time,” Thune said. “But I think the way this is designed, and the way that Sen. Scott has written it; it should be something that I don't know how Republicans couldn't be in favor of what he's trying to get done here.“So, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Obviously, we've still got to get into the debate over here and get through the amendment process and we'll see what the fate of the amendment is on the floor.”Currently 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted the Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.A Scott spokesperson told States Newsroom they would share his amendment once it was final.Still fluidTypically when a major piece of legislation comes to the Senate floor the text is set and amendment debate is closely controlled to ensure delicately negotiated deals don’t crumble in full public view.That isn’t the case this time around and much could change before senators take a final passage vote later this week, potentially as soon as Tuesday.GOP leaders using the complex reconciliation process to move their signature policy bill through Congress means every provision must have an impact on federal spending or revenue that is not “merely incidental.""That involves Democrats and Republicans going before the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official referee, to argue over dozens of provisions. She then decides if a given policy meets the strict and sometimes murky rules.That process hadn’t yet wrapped up when debate on the megabill began and is expected to continue as the 20-hour clock ticks down toward a marathon amendment voting session.Senate bill would add $3.2 trillion to deficitsThere are also increasing concerns among Republicans, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, over how the bill will impact the federal government’s balance sheet during the next decade.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced Sunday morning the Senate’s revised tax and spending cuts package will add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.Trump appeared to try to assuage concerns through a social media post.“For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump wrote. “Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”The latest score came just hours before senators officially began floor debate on the sweeping package that will extend the 2017 GOP tax law, rework how much state governments have to contribute to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, overhaul several aspects of Medicaid and cut its spending, restructure higher education aid programs and much more.Senators voted mostly along party lines late Saturday to proceed with the legislation, though leaders had to hold the vote open for more than three hours as they worked to get the votes needed.Even after taking that crucial procedural step, the bill continued to evolve.The parliamentarian ruled Sunday morning that another six provisions must be revised to comply with the rules or be removed from the 940-page package. One Alaska sweetener knocked outGOP senators cannot include, or might need to restructure, language meant to bring Alaska Republican Sen.

Thom Tillis announced Sunday he won’t seek reelection when his term ends next year, opening up a seat that will become central to control of Congress during next year’s midterms.Tillis’ announcement came just hours after he voted against moving forward with Republicans' tax and spending cuts package, eliciting a wave of criticism on social media from President Donald Trump.Tillis wrote in a statement that it “has been a blessing to go on a journey from living in a trailer park and making minimum wage as a young man to having the honor of serving as U.S. Senator for North Carolina.”His proudest accomplishments, he wrote, were the “bipartisan victories,” including “working across the aisle in the Senate to pass the largest investment in mental health in American history, passing the Respect for Marriage Act and monumental infrastructure investments, and reestablishing the Senate NATO Observer Group.“Sometimes those bipartisan initiatives got me into trouble with my own party, but I wouldn't have changed a single one.”Tillis wrote he looks “forward to continuing to serve North Carolina over the next 18 months. I look forward to solely focusing on producing meaningful results without the distraction of raising money or campaigning for another election. I look forward to having the pure freedom to call the balls and strikes as I see fit and representing the great people of North Carolina to the best of my ability.”Targeted by Trump over voteTills’ announcement followed several hectic days on Capitol Hill, where GOP leaders sought to sway him to support the party’s “big, beautiful bill,” though he ultimately voted against advancing the tax and spending cut legislation toward final passage on Saturday night.That vote elicited a torrent of rebuke from Trump on social media.“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis,” Trump wrote in one post. ‘I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Tillis, 64, became a member of the state House of Representatives in 2007 before rising to become speaker in 2011. He held that position until 2014, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.Tillis secured reelection in 2020 with 48.7% of the vote compared to his Democratic opponent’s 46.9%. The two were separated by fewer than 96,000 votes out of more than 5.2 million cast.His term will officially expire in January 2027, but the contest to replace him is expected to begin quickly.2026 electionRepublicans will want whoever emerges from their primary well positioned to fend off a general election challenge.

A lifelong Nebraskan, U.S. Navy vet and dad, Randall had developed a father-son-like relationship with Jazon Gonzalez Perez, a Guatemalan migrant who managed a couple of local restaurants in the Plattsmouth area where Randall lives. He described Gonzalez Perez as an inquisitive, eager-to-learn hard worker.
The mentorship had grown to the point that Gonzalez Perez called Randall on June 7 when he — while looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work — wound up in a snag with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A cell phone search had led Gonzalez Perez toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base, where he was stopped and detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.
Gonzalez Perez called Randall, who told the Nebraska Examiner he was blindsided by seeing immigration agents take away his buddy. He said conversations with on-site local law enforcement officers led him to believe Gonzalez Perez would be allowed to leave if Randall drove the car. 
Randall said it looked as though the plain-clothed ICE agents were called into duty unexpectedly. One brought a child with him as if the two had been on a family outing. 
“I said, ‘Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. He’s a good kid. He just made a wrong turn,” Randall said, recounting the episode. “I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. 
“He’s none of those.”
 Expected ‘God-fearing’ workers last 

Gonzalez Perez now sits in ICE custody at an Iowa jail, awaiting possible deportation for being in the country without proper authorization. And Randall says he is fuming over tactics he said turned out not to be what he voted for last November. 
He expected “God-fearing” workers to be last in line. For the Plattsmouth-area resident who considers himself an independent swing voter, a different reality has “hit home” and shifted his mindset on federal immigration enforcement.

“Call me naive, but my clear understanding was we were going to go after the bad actors, not hardworking immigrants,” said Randall. 
His frustration intensified in the days after the Offutt turn, as ICE and Homeland Security Investigations on June 10 detained nearly 80 workers from a worksite raid at an Omaha food plant. Not since a 2018 immigration operation in and around O’Neill, which ensnared 133 workers, had Nebraska seen such a large-scale enforcement action.
ICE officials said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was prompted by a federal criminal search warrant suspecting widespread use of stolen identifications by workers there to gain the jobs. So far, available federal court records show three of the workers that were detained have been charged criminally as a result of the operation, including one for stolen ID, though an ICE spokeswoman said Thursday the probe continues.
Raids were conducted days prior to Omaha’s in places such as a Home Depot and in a garment district in Los Angeles, sparking protests that then spilled across the country. Trump’s call for the Marines and California National Guard troops without the consent of that state’s governor escalated tensions.
Polling shows Randall is not alone in his frustration, as people witness the reality of stepped-up immigration enforcement at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration. 
A CBS News survey conducted June 4-6 — prior to widespread protests of ICE arrests in Los Angeles — found 54% of people approved of Trump’s approach to deportations. 
A more recent Quinnipiac University poll, released June 26, indicated 41% of voters  approved of the way Trump is handling immigration issues, compared to 46% who approved three months earlier in the university’s poll from March. 
Approval from independent voters on the immigration question dropped to 32% from 41% in March.

Trump himself has delivered conflicting signals, reportedly ordering officials on June 12 to tap the brakes on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants. Days later, his social media post called for federal officials to “do all in their power” to deliver the “single largest mass deportation” program in history. His major targets: the Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
 Flip flop

The flip-flopping concerns leaders at the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant & Refugee Advancement, saying it “further erodes trust for immigrant communities.” 
CIRA, which provides legal services statewide, said any claim that enforcement is focused on “dangerous” individuals does not align with what its lawyers are seeing on the ground. It said mothers and fathers, including some who had been in the U.S. for decades, are being “ripped” from their families.
“This is not a public safety initiative — it’s political theater and our communities are paying the price,” the statement said.
According to TRAC, a widely-used national clearinghouse that tracks immigration and detention trends, ICE as of mid-June reported detaining 56,397 people  — up from 38,525 a year ago and a record high since 2019 when the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse began publishing semi-monthly statistics.
TRAC said nearly 72% of the detainees had no previous criminal conviction. Of the 28% who did, TRAC said many had been convicted of offenses such as minor traffic violations.

Longtime Omaha immigration attorney Rachel Yamamoto said she has noticed a pivot by federal officials to go after “easy pickings, low-hanging fruit,” apparently to meet the reported quotas of up to 3,000 arrests daily demanded by the Trump administration. 
She pointed out her own clients: a mother-daughter duo detained June 4 at an appointment that in years past was a routine “check in.” 
Maria De Leon of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, had entered the U.S. in 2014, with 3-year-old daughter Hermelinda in tow. She was released at the border to await a “credible fear” interview with federal officials that came six years later.
Her plea to stay was denied, and she was under an Order of Supervision to check in annually with immigration officials, Yamamoto said. Federal officials did not violate any rules in detaining De Leon, the attorney noted, as the food plant worker had an outstanding order of removal. But she called it “a drastic change from usual procedures.”
“She’s been on this order of supervision since 2014,” Yamamoto said of De Leon. “Everything was fine every year, until now. She’s never been arrested. She’s had a work permit. Her husband is working legally.” 
Yamamoto and De Leon’s husband, who was waiting in another room, were particularly taken aback that Hermelinda, 14, also was detained. Yamamoto was with the mom and daughter when agents asked the teen to empty her pockets. She pulled out her phone and a lip gloss.
“That moment was horrible,” Yamamoto said. “Her eyes got big, like, ‘Am I being detained right now?’ I’m glad they didn’t cuff them.”
In past experience, Yamamoto said, youths typically were allowed to stay with the other parent. De Leon’s husband, Abel, had arrived in the U.S. two years prior to his wife and daughter, fleeing gangs, and has had an active asylum application pending for more than a decade in a backlogged court system. The couple’s 10-year-old son, born in the U.S., remains with dad in their South Omaha home.
De Leon’s family received word a few days later that mother and daughter were together in a family ICE facility in Texas. Yamamoto said the mom likely has no chance to stay in the U.S., though Hermelinda appears eligible for an asylum interview. 
 Businessman’s view

Immigration arrests have increased nationwide and more than doubled in 38 states since Trump took office Jan. 20, the New York Times reported Friday.
Nebraska has averaged 4.3 daily arrests — a 343% rise from 2024, the newspaper reported, based on data obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Deportation Data Project at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.
The data covers administrative arrests (those in which ICE seeks to deport rather than criminally prosecute the arrestee) conducted by the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division through June 10. It does not include criminal arrests, arrests made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations divisions or Customs and Border Protection.
From a small businessman’s perspective, Gary Jenkins of Omaha said he was confused and in unfamiliar territory when a Guatemalan crew member was apprehended by ICE agents who followed him and his brother on a recent Saturday work morning into a gas station.
Omahan who is U.S. citizen spends two nights in jail on immigration ‘hold,’ drawing criticism

Jenkins said he jumped into action to find legal help for the man he said reported loyally to housing renovation job sites for years. He described the man, in his early 40s, as a father of three. His understanding is that the worker had missed an immigration court date in New York while living in Omaha.
Soon after his detention, the man was returned to his homeland. His wife and kids remain in the Omaha area, as does a brother, who Jenkins says has legal status.
“These guys are over here doing great work,” he said. “Now I have to go out and find somebody I can trust and believe in.” 
Federal officials paint a different picture. Mark Zito, special agent in charge of a Homeland Security Investigations office that covers Omaha, recently took aim at people supporting workers detained at Glenn Valley — pointing out havoc that can occur if an undocumented worker uses a stolen Social Security number to gain employment. 
Federal officials have said that 100 “real victims” face financial and emotional consequences as a result of their identities being used fraudulently at Glenn Valley.











These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans.


– Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations office in Omaha 



“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” Zito said in a statement. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives, isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
ICE offered a handful of examples, including: a Texan struggling to get Social Security disability payments as their ID was being fraudulently used to earn wages at Glenn Valley; a Coloradoan asked to repay $5,000 after their income was falsely increased due to wages earned at Glenn Valley, and a nursing student from Missouri losing out on college financial assistance because fraudulent use of ID pushed up income. 
 Gov. Pillen calls hard workers ‘A-OK’

Longtime South Omahan Sharon Boll sees the complexities, and sides with Trump policies.
She recently sat in a lawn chair watching an anti-ICE rally unfold in her neighborhood. She expressed empathy for families separated by deportations and trying to fix their residency status and respected the right to protest. 
“I know the long citizenship path is a pain in the butt, but they need to be here legally,” said Boll, who had a large framed image of Jesus Christ propped on a chair next to her.  “A lot less harm will come to them.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, — quick to say he is “a 100% supporter of ICE” — has revealed a nuanced opinion of immigration enforcement, depending on the situation.

He said he has been to the border: “I’ve seen criminals and terrorists and kids being loaded like pack mules full of fentanyl and synthetic methamphetamines coming from China. Safety is the highest calling of government, that we get the criminals and terrorists out of here. That’s the focus and what I believe in.”
Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner he was “not talking about” established immigrant families, though, and urged Congress to “fix the immigration issue.” 
“Anybody that is here working hard and being a good neighbor, they’re A-OK. They’re fine,” Pillen said.
He said he did see a problem at the Glenn Valley operation because of “concentration of folks doing criminal activity of stealing people’s ID — that’s a grave offense.”
 Stopped at Offutt gate 

Randall said he had been supportive of Trump’s crackdown when he understood the target to be high-level criminals.
Admittedly, he said he does not know all the intricacies of immigration law and what it takes for a foreign-born worker to enter or remain in the country with U.S. permission. He said he is familiar, however, with the manager at one of his go-to diners that he came to know as a sort of “adopted son.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Over time, he learned that Gonzalez Perez had left his homeland to try and make a better living and help his siblings. His dad is a farmer in Guatemala, and his mom is deceased.
On a recent Saturday, Gonzalez Perez set out to make a bank deposit for his employer. The regular bank site was closed at the time. His boss told him it could wait, but Gonzalez Perez said he wanted to make sure payroll could be met, said Randall.
The online search led Gonzalez Perez to a satellite branch on the Offutt base property. A statement from Offutt’s public affairs chief said the man was detained at the gate, after presenting a Guatemalan ID card rather than a valid driver’s license.

Per security protocol, 55th Wing Security Forces contacted the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office and ICE “due to the individual operating a vehicle without a valid license and presenting a foreign identification card with no documentation authorizing access to the installation,” said Kris “Krispy” Pierce, who heads public affairs for the 55th Wing and Offutt. 
“The safety and security of our installation and personnel remain our highest priority,” said Pierce.
Randall, called by Gonzalez Perez, said he first spoke by phone to an onsite sheriff’s deputy and, based on conversations, believed he would be able to drive his friend off base. Upon arriving, he found Gonzalez Perez sitting in his car blocked by cones. 
Immigration agents later arrived, ran information through a device and put his friend in handcuffs, respectfully and without incident, Randall said. Gonzalez Perez is in ICE custody at the Pottawattamie County Jail.
 ‘Tipping point’

Gonzalez Perez has an immigration court hearing scheduled in early July.
His attorney said she prefers not to comment on the case.
Randall said he is monitoring closely. He believes deportation and immigration policy could be a political “tipping point” for independent voters like himself. 
“I’m all for arresting bad actors. I think we all are,” Randall said. “That’s not what happened here.”

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

BAY VIEW, Skagit County — On a cloudy Friday morning, a group of volunteers huddled on the shore of the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, peering over Angelica Lucchetto’s shoulder at an array of shed crab exoskeletons, called molts.
“You can tell this is a green crab because it has five marginal teeth,” explained Lucchetto, an invasive species specialist at the Reserve, pointing out the spikes along the front of a spotted greenish molt.
At that same time, similar groups gathered across the Salish Sea as part of a “Molt Blitz” to see if they could find any molts belonging to the invasive European green crab.

Though invasive crabs are a concern to ecosystems across Puget Sound, Padilla Bay must protect something extra special: 8,000 acres of eelgrass.
A powerful meadow 

	
Eelgrass might not seem like a top priority — it certainly doesn’t look like one. At low tide, when Padilla Bay turns into a muddy expanse, the soggy eelgrass is left strewn across the ground like forgotten party ribbons.
But Jude Apple, the research coordinator at Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, insists that the eelgrass meadow, which is the second largest on North America’s Pacific Coast, is worth protecting.
“It’s habitat for all the commercial organisms that we’re interested in … juvenile Dungeness crabs, herring, salmon — all kinds of organisms use the eelgrass as a home or as a nursery,” Apple said.

Many of those organisms are also “culturally significant species and first foods,” according to Sophia Ammons, a GIS program manager for the Samish Indian Nation’s Department of Natural Resources.
“It’s really important that we have that habitat so we can continually protect the species that are important for Samish and other coastal tribes,” Ammons said.
Eelgrass also has other superpowers. It keeps the sediment on the Bay’s floor in place, which reduces erosion of the shoreline and lowers flood risk. Studies show that landscapes like Padilla Bay also capture and store a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — more than a forest the same size could. That helps slow the rate of climate change and keeps the ocean’s water from turning too acidic, which harms organisms like shellfish.
One 2024 study even found that eelgrass could clean up pathogens that would otherwise end up in seafood. Though they aren’t sure how it works, the authors of that study found that mussels living near eelgrass contain up to 65% less harmful bacteria than mussels far from eelgrass, suggesting eelgrass could be used as a tool to ensure food safety and security.
Threats to eelgrass 
Padilla Bay’s eelgrass is going to get harder to protect, as rising ocean temperatures will make it harder for eelgrass to survive and facilitate the spread of fatal eelgrass wasting disease. If European green crabs become common, they’ll put even more pressure on the already threatened ecosystem. The crabs tend to uproot the eelgrass as they dig for sea worms or shellfish in the silt, and sometimes even gobble up the eelgrass itself.

“It’s not a threat yet, but there’s potential as the population increases,” Apple explained. “That’s why we’re doing a lot of trapping to prevent green crab populations from getting established.”
On Washington’s outer coast, established populations of European green crabs now dominate some coastlines. In 2024, more than 1 million European green crabs were caught between Willapa Bay and Gray’s Harbor alone.
Laura Kraft, a Washington State University researcher working in Willapa Bay, hopes that biologists around Puget Sound can keep invasive crabs out of precious sites like Padilla Bay. The urgency of that goal became even clearer in May, when a study Kraft worked on found that even young European green crabs could be a big threat.
Kraft’s team observed that juveniles are just as capable as adults of breaking open many species of clams and oysters to eat. Plus, they’re menaces around eelgrass.

“Not only were European green crabs feeding on eelgrass, but they were also just arbitrarily clipping it,” Kraft said, “and when the leaf is gone from the plant, it’s no longer able to grow.”
Kraft’s team conducted the study to try and figure out which species are the most important to protect now that it’s likely too late to get rid of European green crabs on the outer coast. But the reality of it being too late was hard for Kraft to come to terms with.
“I almost want to pause and grieve that for a moment,” Kraft shared. “It’s very frustrating to not have a better solution.”
Puget Sound is more protected than the outer coast — with shallower waters and only one way in and out — so it took some time before the European green crabs wound up here. The first one was spotted in the Sound in 2016. But the numbers have only gone up since then: In 2023, only a few dozen green crabs were found in Puget Sound; in 2024, that number shot up to more than 200.
A Salish Sea-wide effort
Padilla Bay — let alone Puget Sound — is massive. That’s why Washington Sea Grant, the organization that coordinated the Molt Blitz, created a way for citizens to help with monitoring efforts.

The blitz was not the only opportunity to contribute to invasive crab monitoring efforts; any Puget Sound resident can help collect data for the Molt Search program, any time of year.
At the end of their search on Friday, volunteers circled back together to sort the crab shells they found by species, counting up how many of each kind they had. Their piles only contained the multicolored molts of familiar native crabs — no European green crab molts in sight.
“That’s what we like to see,” Lucchetto said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Is it possible that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
The post Offshore wind is alive and well. Maybe we should just keep quiet about that.  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IS IT POSSIBLE that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of offshore wind power a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction. 
Candidate Donald Trump vowed that, if he were elected, the offshore wind industry would end on “day one” of his second term, and his Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Environmental Protection Agency immediately began the process of pulling approvals and denying permits on projects up and down the East Coast. 
Some projects did fold in the face of poor approval prospects and investor departures – but the industry is quietly completing massive projects that will supply power to millions of homes. 
Dominion Energy continues to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project in the waters off Virginia after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated – albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete about 30 miles from Virginia Beach.  In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.  
With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well. 
So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future. 
Meanwhile, the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project, 20 miles southeast of Long Island, is now back under construction.  
Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half a million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind. 
Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support. 
Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.  
After a devastating turbine break stopped construction last July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work on its 806-megawatt project 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. The project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is now generating electricity from 10 of 62 planned turbines. 
Each of these projects has – so far – survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations, and transmission cables; phony “grassroots” organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed. 
Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers – and maybe you can’t blame them. 
In May, one of the directors of the Dominion project said that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green, or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power. 
Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations. 
They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean. 
Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power – these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)WATERTOWN — It’s a simple life that seemed impossible two years ago. Now it could be in jeopardy. 
In the South Dakota home of displaced Ukrainians Ilona and Valerii Biliaze, sun shines through gauzy curtains as their 7-month-old baby naps below a window. Their 16-year-old son scrolls Instagram in his room after school, and their 12-year-old daughter lounges on her bed, sandwiched between school friends while gossiping.
Valerii is a self-employed contractor. Ilona stays home, watching their infant son when the kids are at school.
A town saved a nonprofit office to help laid-off immigrant workers find jobs. Now it’s all in peril.

Two years ago, they were refugees in France struggling to find work and make a living. They fled their home of Mariupol — one of the first cities Russia attacked in Ukraine — five weeks after the war broke out.
When the invasion began in 2022, electricity and heat were cut off as shelling became a constant background noise. Their children slept in a closet, never allowed to leave or approach the windows. They found shelter in a relative’s apartment after their own apartment building was razed by tank fire. 
Valerii passed dead bodies — neighbors, friends, strangers — as he sought food and water for their family. He risked his life each time he stepped outside their door, while snipers aimed at him and others as they collected water near the seaside.
They escaped all that and found a new home in South Dakota. But by Aug. 17, the life they’ve built could be gone.

The Biliazes are among 117,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States through the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program after fleeing the Russian invasion.
The effort is known as a humanitarian parole program. It’s carried out under the U.S. Homeland Security secretary’s authority to allow noncitizens into the country with a sponsor on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons.
Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota — the state’s designated refugee resettlement agency — has welcomed 484 Ukrainians to the state since the U4U program started in 2022. The nonprofit additionally worked on parole cases involving 90 Haitians and 169 Cubans in federal fiscal year 2024. There may also be legally admitted Ukrainians, Cubans and Haitians in South Dakota who haven’t opted to work with LSS.
The Trump administration and its Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — the former governor of South Dakota — have terminated the humanitarian parole status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, among other sweeping changes to immigration policy and enforcement. 
The administration has not terminated the status of U4U participants, but has paused new applications to the program, including extension requests. The Department of Homeland Security erroneously sent emails to U4U participants in April saying their protected status was revoked. Although the emails were sent in error, they stoked fears that an actual revocation could follow.

Congress has not offered a pathway to legal permanent residency for Ukrainian parolees. When the Biliazes hit their two-year anniversary of arriving in Watertown in August, their parole will expire. They were denied in April for asylum — another form of legal residency for people with a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. Their options include returning to war-torn Ukraine, seeking refuge in a new country or waiting as they appeal their asylum case.
The Biliazes do not know where they will go. If they return to Ukraine, Valerii and their oldest son might have to fight in the war they worked so hard to escape. They already sought refuge in France, but were not able to secure work and were moved every three months within the country.










We don’t have a plan. We don’t even want to think about starting over again.


– Ilona Biliaze


The couple have been taking English classes in the U.S., anticipating they would make Watertown their permanent home. Humanitarian parole, before this administration, could be extended for decades on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole in the U.S. began in 1956.
The Biliazes’ daughter is nearly fluent in English. Their youngest child is an American-born citizen.
“We don’t have a plan,” Ilona told South Dakota Searchlight through a translator. “We don’t even want to think about starting over again.”
Taxes, work and school: ‘They’re contributing’
Susan and Bruce Buhler sweep into the Biliaze house with full-bodied hugs. Susan lifts the baby from his mother’s arms, doting on him and urging him to say “Babushka” or grandmother. She’s been studying Russian to more easily communicate with the family.
The two retirees live a few blocks away, and they serve as the family’s main sponsor. Their basement was the Biliazes’ home for 10 months after they arrived in the United States.
“We had space,” Bruce said. “They were people in need and we felt terrible about families being displaced.”

Ilona filled out an application online for the U4U program while they were in France and posted a profile of their family, hoping to find a required American sponsor to help pay the family’s way to the country, secure jobs and fill out paperwork. Bruce helped Valerii secure construction work within three days of living in Watertown. The couple also taught them how to drive in South Dakota.
Eight families from the Buhlers’ church pooled funds to sponsor a family after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Bruce and Susan selected the family off a website “like a dating site,” based on their family photo and a resume, Susan recalled. 
The two families spent most summer nights visiting and playing games on the Buhlers’ screened-in backyard deck. Once Ilona and Valerii found out they were expecting, they rented their own house.
Valerii and Ilona own two vehicles. They bought furniture for their new home. Valerii paid thousands in federal taxes this year. They named their son Brian — the most American name they could think of.
“An All-American name for an American boy,” Valerii said in English, smiling proudly.

Bruce chafes when he thinks about the family being forced out of the country.
“It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “They’re living their lives, paying taxes, contributing. They’re here legally. Anyone I bring it up to would tell you it’s crazy.”
Bruce said there are about a dozen other Ukrainian families living in Watertown on humanitarian parole. More families followed in the months after the Biliazes arrived, moving to Watertown under other sponsor families.
Two of the families left the country before the end of their parole, hoping to find refuge in European countries.
“They’re kicking people out who are good and hardworking,” Bruce said. “We need as many people in the workforce as we can get.”
Uncertainty creates anxiety within Ukrainian, Haitian communities
Ilona and Valerii applied for asylum in August last year, hoping it would offer a new avenue to citizenship or stall their impending deportation if the Ukrainian humanitarian parole program wasn’t renewed. Fleeing a war does not necessarily justify asylum. The status is based on persecution of a person’s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership in their home country, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The Biliazes received a rejection in April, and their attorney wrote a 19-page rebuttal. They are waiting for a determination on their appeal, but they don’t have much hope.
Since they applied for asylum, though, they were approved for a new work permit authorizing Ilona and their daughter to potentially live and work in the United States through June 2030, as long as their asylum case remains pending. The family is waiting to hear if they’ve been approved work permits for Valerii and their oldest son.
  Susan Buhler admires Dominika Biliaze’s makeup in Watertown on May 12, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Those permits could keep them in the country past August, if the case isn’t decided before then. The average processing time for asylum is five years, said Lutheran Social Service State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas. The Trump administration hopes to speed the process up.
If the asylum office doesn’t make a decision on the family’s appeal before their August deportation date, or decides to reject it, it’ll be forwarded to an immigration court. There, the Biliazes will be placed in deportation proceedings, where they’ll have another chance to have asylum decided by a judge.
Bruce Blumer, founder of Haiti Alive, sponsors a Haitian family living in South Dakota. The family of four are in the country under humanitarian parole, Blumer said, but they have “gnawing anxiety” after their work permits were terminated. They have until August before they have to leave the country.










The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do. They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country.


– Bruce Blumer


The Federal Aviation Administration has extended its ban on U.S. flights to Haiti’s capital until Sept. 8, citing security risks from armed gangs.
“You’re sending these people back into dangerous, difficult and probably life threatening situations,” Blumer said.
Fortunately, Blumer said, Canada is accepting Haitians. The family he sponsors has been able to secure Canadian visas and plans to relocate there, he said, instead of returning to Haiti.
Ending the United States humanitarian parole programs is “nothing short of vindictive,” Blumer added.
“The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do,” Blumer said. “They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country. They had an added step of having a sponsor to willingly contribute financially and vouch for these families.”
The Buhlers have sought help from South Dakota’s congressional delegates, but they have only received “generic responses” back. They don’t know where else to turn.
The Biliazes hope something will change.
“We’re still hoping we get to stay,” Ilona said. “This is our home.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota community rallied to keep a local nonprofit office serving immigrants and refugees in the area open earlier this year. But now those neighbors face uncertainty as federal policy changes force them out of the workforce and potentially out of the country. And the nonprofit is struggling with an uncertain future as federal funding and policy changes impair the organization. 
Sioux Falls-based Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota announced it would close its Yankton office in March due to a loss of federal funding. More than $50,000 fundraised by the Yankton community since then will help keep that LSS office open for at least another year.
‘This is our home’: Ukrainians settled in SD fear Trump-Noem policies will force them to leave

President Donald Trump cut funding used to help new refugees adjust to life in the United States through organizations like LSS, which resettles refugees on behalf of the federal government.
The nonprofit eliminated 13 positions due to the loss and absorbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses to provide resettlement services to those who arrived in America in the months before Trump assumed office, said CEO Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen. The nonprofit also provides adoption, foster care, juvenile justice and behavioral health services to South Dakotans beyond its resettlement services.
She anticipates more funding cuts in the coming months. The changes are part of a “systematic dismantling of resettlement in the U.S.,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.
“What we’re feeling is we’re not going to see any substantive refugee resettlement in South Dakota in the near future.” 
Yankton population increases supported by immigration growth
Lutheran Social Services opened the Yankton office in 2022 to meet the needs of the area’s growing immigrant population.
The number of people identifying as Hispanic or Latino doubled in Yankton County between 2010 and 2020. The county’s overall population increased by about 872 people during the same period, according to Census data. Its Hispanic and Latino population alone increased by 620.
Driving much of that increase in Hispanic and Latino populations was a wave of Cuban immigrants moving to the area, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Many Cubans are living and working in the community legally through humanitarian parole, which is a temporary immigration status for individuals to live and work under a sponsor in the United States because they face a humanitarian crisis in their home country.
Lutheran Social Services worked with 143 Cuban humanitarian parole cases, or 169 people, in federal fiscal year 2024. There may be additional humanitarian parolees in South Dakota who haven’t contacted LSS for help, according to the nonprofit. 
The Yankton LSS office closure announcement coincided with the March closing of Cimpl’s Meats, a major employer in Yankton, which laid off more than 250 employees in March, many of whom were Cuban humanitarian parolees.

Those immigrants relied on Lutheran Social Services to find reemployment, said Rita Nelson, who formerly worked on workforce development at Yankton Thrive and sits on the Connecting Cultures Yankton board, which is affiliated with the economic development organization. The Yankton LSS office offers legal services, community orientation, health care navigation and job-seeking services. The state Department of Labor and Regulation also hosted a job fair to help workers apply for employment.
Immigrants in Yankton provide a sense of vibrancy and economic stability needed in the community, Nelson said. People moving in and starting families — whether foreign-born or not — work, live and spend money to support their families and area businesses.
“We all want individuals to be able to navigate the immigration process legally,” Nelson said, “and they can’t do that without a resource and someone who can help them.”
That feeling motivated Nelson and others to start a fundraising effort in April to keep the local LSS office open. Muddy Mo’s Coffee House owners posted about the fundraiser on social media and set a tip jar on the counter labeled “Help Your Neighbors.” The shop is owned by Katie Hunhoff, owner of South Dakota Magazine and daughter of the magazine’s founder and former state lawmaker Bernie Hunhoff.

The support reminded Bernie of times when farmers get sick or injured and neighbors rush to harvest the corn or bale the hay. It was an opportunity for people whose “hearts are with the Cimpl’s workers” to help.
Clients who use the LSS office were notified when it intended to close. They were also notified when their neighbors stepped in to keep the office open “because the community cares about them,” Hunhoff said.
“I think what happened in Yankton is powerful evidence this is where our community wants to go: We want to be good neighbors to everybody, and America is better as a welcoming place,” Hunhoff said.
Uncertainty for immigrants remains after community saves LSS office
Weeks after the community raised thousands of dollars to help their neighbors find reemployment through LSS, many of those same workers have been laid off again.
This time it was because the Supreme Court at the end of May upheld the Trump administration’s revocation of the Biden-era Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela parole program and elimination of the legal status of over 500,000 immigrants.
Cuban parolees are able to apply for U.S. citizenship through the Cuban Adjustment Act. While that pathway to citizenship is still open, said LSS State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas, the work permits of immigrants in the program were terminated. Several were laid off because “their work permits aren’t valid in the system anymore even if they expire next year,” she said.

The nonprofit is working with about 500 people affected by the terminated work permits statewide, to direct them toward legal services.
“A lot of people, unless they talk to an attorney, think they have no options to stay, they can’t file, and they have to leave,” Boraas said. “They get this scary notice saying, ‘You have to go home.’ We keep saying, ‘Talk to an attorney, talk to an attorney.’”
Yankton will be hurt if dozens of local immigrant families are forced out of the country, Hunhoff said.
“Of course, life will go on in Yankton and the other communities, but it’s a loss — not just economically but more so in terms of decency and fairness — and it’s contrary to everything we always believed about small town America,” Hunhoff said. “Maybe we aren’t the beacon of hope and morality we’ve always thought we were? That’s being tested.”
LSS faces more federal funding cuts
The Yankton community’s work to help its neighbors and the nonprofit is a “bright spot” for Lutheran Social Services, Kiesow-Knudsen said. But the organization’s funding troubles persist.
The nonprofit incurred about a half-million dollars in costs after the changes to immigration policy at the federal level, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Much of it was reimbursed by the federal government, after U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., argued that those funds were committed before Trump’s immigration overhaul. About $100,000 in expenses remain, Kiesow-Knudsen said.
The nonprofit continued to provide resettlement services for refugees who arrived in the United States within a few months of President Trump’s inauguration.
“It didn’t seem ethical to us to cut those people off,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It’s a story as old as our country. We welcome people.”
The nonprofit will have to cover the costs with funds from its foundation if the remainder is not reimbursed by the end of June.

The nonprofit is also working to understand what its role will be in the new federal fiscal year. As of October, Lutheran Social Services will no longer receive federal support for refugee resettlement directly from the federal government, under Trump’s new immigration policy.
South Dakota is one of 14 “replacement designee” states for refugee resettlement, meaning the funding goes directly to a nonprofit agency — such as LSS — rather than through the state. LSS has been the exclusive provider of refugee resettlement services in South Dakota for 25 years.
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration will have to decide if South Dakota state government will take on its refugee program internally, like North Dakota or Minnesota; or contract the work out to another agency, in which case LSS could potentially be selected again; or decide not to accept any refugees. Wyoming is the only state that does not accept refugees.
LSS also lost a grant to help refugees find employment faster and a nearly $300,000 Department of Homeland Security grant used to provide education and legal assistance for immigrants working to become citizens. The legal services formerly cost $50 and classes were free. Now, legal services and classes cost $800 for anyone seeking citizenship. 
“That’s our breakeven cost to be able to pay the staff,” Boraas said.
The nonprofit is also facing additional cuts proposed in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” under consideration in the U.S. Senate, that would eliminate funding for adult education and to help refugees who are in the United States for less than five years.
“I feel comfortable that we can provide services through September 2026, and then we’ll see based on what happens in Congress,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.

Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.

Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.

Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help to shore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.

Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Larry Satcowitz: Gov. Phil Scott, we’ve never needed you more. Where are you?.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives, and the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.


I was scheduled to be the final speaker at the “No Kings” rally in Burlington last week. Unfortunately, the event ran longer than anticipated, and I was not able to address the crowd. Here’s what I had planned to say: 
Good afternoon. My name is Larry Satcowitz. I’m a state representative from Randolph.
In these terrible and deeply disturbing times, it is a great joy to see you all today. Your presence gives me hope that we are a part of a large and growing resistance movement. Your presence gives me hope that we will thwart the billionaires and fascists that are currently in control of our federal government. 
We heard many wonderful speakers today. One person, however, was notably absent: Our governor, Republican, Phil Scott.
The Democratic Party is united in its opposition to Donald Trump. Every time a Democrat, like me, stands up, exactly no one is surprised. But opposition to Trump should not be a partisan issue. The president is destroying our democracy. He is destroying our economy. He is actively undermining our national security and the rule of law. These should not be partisan issues. 
A Republican governor who spoke out loudly, boldly and vigorously against the travesty taking place in Washington would do so with a special kind of authority. I remind you that Donald Trump and Phil Scott are on the same team.
I and others have recently published commentaries that ran in outlets all over the state, calling on our governor to speak out forcefully against the horrors that we are protesting here today. Days later Phil Scott issued a statement saying, “We must not allow ourselves to be distracted or live in a constant state of fear, anger or outrage.”
I can tell you that I have been terribly distracted since Jan. 20, I’ve been afraid for my country ever since that date. I am angry every single time I read the news. This is our reality, and we must face it.
Phil Scott called what’s going on “national rhetoric.”
He further wrote: “To move the Nation past the chaos Washington is causing, we need to rise above it and lead by example.” 
We do need to lead by example. The leaders who have preceded me on stage here today have done just that. If we followed our governor’s lead, we would not be here today at all.
There are Republicans who are opposed to what the president is doing. I believe Phil Scott is one of them. Imagine if he, as governor, took a clear, moral stand against the wrongdoings of the Trump administration. Imagine his leadership inspiring other Republican governors to stand up and do the same. Imagine the difference that would make for our country.
We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its recklessness in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its outrageous corruption in the strongest possible terms.
Phil Scott frequently reminds us about how he is the governor of all Vermonters. All of us. Well, Phil, at this moment, we need you. We’ve never needed you more. Where are you? Why aren’t you here, with us, right now?

But with net population decline projected by 2050 and sub-par educational outcomes among Michigan children, we need to be serious about creating a state where kids can get ahead. Immigrant families are critical to our state reaching its full potential. 
In the past decade, immigrants have accounted for nearly 60% of the state’s population growth, while contributing billions in state revenue and economic activity. Yet a new swath of regulations, largely aimed to deter immigration, could do irreparable harm to many of our state’s youngest and most vulnerable residents.
In recent years, a surge of Unaccompanied Children (UCs) has crossed the southern border, entering Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody. These minors flee extreme circumstances where migration becomes an option of last resort. Michigan nonprofits serve children who made deadly journeys to earn money for their mothers’ cancer treatments or escape coercive recruitment into criminal enterprises.

The Trump administration has characterized these vulnerable children — 67% of whom are aged 16 or younger — as a national security threat, directing ICE to specifically target them for deportation. A multi-agency review of 450,000 unaccompanied minors is underway, enabled by revoking the DHS sensitive locations policy that previously protected schools, churches and hospitals from immigration raids.
In February, ICE began conducting “wellness checks” on immigrant children at schools — what the Young Center calls “a pretext to locate, interrogate and deport children and families.” A new plan proposes mobilizing 21,000 National Guard troops to round up UCs.
The administration also targets children by attacking the adults they rely on. After arrival, UCs transfer to ORR custody for shelter and basic necessities. Most unaccompanied children are then released to the custody of a sponsor, usually a close family member, until their legal status is adjudicated. However, new policy changes enable ICE to obtain the legal status of sponsors from ORR, putting undocumented sponsors at deportation risk.
Central to this campaign is terminating the Flores Settlement Agreement — the backbone of child protections requiring the provision of food, water, clean clothing and medical care in government custody. While courts have historically upheld the Flores Settlement Agreement, successfully overturning it would enable indefinite detention of children in prison-like conditions.
Already, new Trump administration rules requiring stringent sponsor identification verification now keep children in shelters an average 217 days before family release — up dramatically from previous timelines.
On top of this, a proposed budget reconciliation fine could charge sponsors up to $8,500 per child, while other provisions impose $1,000 asylum application fees and $500 Special Immigrant Visa fees — visas UCs often need when aging out at 18. These barriers create pay-to-play systems, effectively holding children ransom from families.
Funding cuts are eliminating vital services. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), the state’s primary legal provider for unaccompanied minors, supporting 800 children, faced a March stop-work order cutting legal funding and forcing 72 layoffs. This leaves young children — including toddlers — to navigate the U.S. legal system alone.
Budget reconciliation threatens additional vital benefits for children. The proposed Child Tax Credit changes would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to qualify, potentially denying the $2,000 credit to 4.5 million American citizen children under age 17 based solely on their parents’ immigration status. Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could affect 400,000 legal refugees and asylum recipients, while broader benefit reductions threaten extended family support systems that children depend upon.
When parents face deportation or detention, children experience toxic stress, which impairs brain development and increases risks of chronic mental health conditions, including depression and PTSD, plus physical conditions like cancer, stroke, diabetes and heart disease. Research shows most children experience at least four adverse behavioral changes following immigration-related parental arrests — such as chronic fear and disrupted eating and sleeping patterns.
These trauma responses directly undermine educational achievement and workforce preparation at a time when immigrants account for nearly 60% of Michigan’s population growth over the past decade.
The cumulative effect could devastate Michigan families. With 300,000 Michigan children living in immigrant families — including 70,000 high schoolers representing 15% of the state’s high school population — Michigan’s economic future depends on these families’ stability.
Michigan teachers and superintendents already report declining attendance among immigrant children, imperiling long-term development while families rush to create guardianships fearing deportations. By destabilizing families representing such a significant portion of Michigan’s emerging workforce, these enforcement policies risk creating a traumatized generation while threatening the state’s economic growth and development goals.
The Michigan League for Public Policy and our partners are working to make sure all kids have a chance to grow up strong and healthy in our state. We can’t risk Michigan’s future, or the lives of thousands of innocent kids who are looking for opportunity and family reunification, with shortsighted and harmful restrictions like these.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/asylum-seeker.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-29 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Cindy Hyde-Smith hopes 2026 will be her first easy U.S. Senate campaign,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/29/cindy-hyde-smith-2026-hopes/,"Column: So far, Cindy Hyde-Smith's campaigns for U.S. Senate have not been easy in any way. Will her reelection bid in 2026 be any different?","The recent announcement that state Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner Andy Gipson plans to run for governor has fueled speculation about who will be running for what office in a wide open 2027 Mississippi election cycle.
Will all or any of the combination of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Auditor Shad White, Attorney General Lynn Fitch enter the gubernatorial donnybrook? Who will be the Democratic Party standard bearer, and will Democrats field competitive candidates for any of the other down-ticket statewide offices that could be vacant based on who is running for governor?
Perhaps, most importantly, will billionaire businessman Thomas Duff of Hattiesburg enter the gubernatorial race after showing numerous signals that he intends to?
But before the 2027 elections roll around there will be another consequential statewide race in Mississippi: for the U.S. Senate in 2026.
Incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith will be running in her third U.S. Senate race, and she surely hopes it will be her first easy one. Her first race, a special election in 2018 after longtime Sen. Thad Cochran retired, was the closest non-party primary U.S. Senate race in modern Mississippi history. Hyde-Smith, running then as the interim appointment of former Gov. Phil Bryant, captured 53.6% of the vote compared to 46.4% for Espy in the special election held to fill out Cochran’s term.
Trent Lott’s first race for the U.S. Senate was almost as close in 1988, when he won 53.9% to 46.1% against 4th District U.S. Rep. Wayne Dowdy. And in a 2008 special election, Republican Roger Wicker, appointed by Gov. Haley Barbour to fill a vacancy left when Lott retired, garnered 55% to 45% by former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove.
But after those relatively close elections, both Lott in 1994 and Wicker in 2012 had easier second elections.
Lott captured 69% of the vote against former state Sen. Ken Harper of Vicksburg. Wicker, on the other hand, had a little tougher race against Albert Gore, winning 57% to 40.6%. Gore was little known and underfunded, but was in many ways an attractive candidate with a noteworthy resume. Interestingly, Gore, like Wicker, was a Pontotoc County native.
In Hyde-Smith’s second race, she again faced Espy in a rare Mississippi campaign when the Democrat raised more money than the Republican. It is practically unheard of in the South — and assuredly in Mississippi — for a Democrat to raise more campaign funds than an incumbent Republican senator. Espy did.
Still, Hyde-Smith, who remains Mississippi’s only woman elected to a federal office, won 54.1% to 44.1%, but the campaign was far from easy for her.
The trend for decades has been that once a U.S. Senate seat is won in Mississippi, the incumbent holds the post for a long time with minimal opposition.
Hyde-Smith is still looking for that minimal opposition race. Will 2026 be when Hyde-Smith finally has an easy path to victory like other incumbent Mississippi senators normally have in their reelection efforts?
Perhaps hoping to ensure that easier path, President Donald Trump already has endorsed Hyde-Smith for her 2026 campaign.
But Trump also endorsed her in 2018 and 2020. Those endorsements did not result in easy campaigns for Hyde-Smith. In both of those campaigns, Hyde-Smith underperformed Trump’s Mississippi results.
Democrats Ty Pinkins and Albert Littell, both of whom have military backgrounds, already have announced their candidacy for 2026. Speculation is that District Attorney Scott Colom of Columbus also will challenge Hyde-Smith. And on the Republican side, author Sarah Adlakha, a Gulf Coast resident who works in health care, also has announced her campaign.
Whether other candidates emerge remains to be seen. And whether Hyde-Smith can experience a less stressful 2026 also remains to be seen.
So far the campaigns have not been as easy for her as for other incumbent U.S. senators from Mississippi.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06203518/AP_20309179341434-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-29 08:01:48.549378

Vermont’s farmers are growing crops that better suit the state’s warmer and wetter climate — and branching into products that provide income even when traditional crops fail. 
Since 1900, annual temperatures in Vermont have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit and annual precipitation has increased by 21% over the same span, according to the state. The changes have forced agriculture to adapt in sometimes surprising ways.

Now that winters are milder, it has become commonplace for Vermont orchards to grow peaches. Nick Cowles owns Shelburne Orchards, and 35 years ago, he saw a bedraggled peach tree at a hardware store and bought it on a whim. Since then — especially in more recent years — peaches have become a lucrative addition to his business. 
Peach trees like rain, and so the increased precipitation in Vermont does not bother them. Historically, temperatures posed a problem for peach-growing.
“It takes around 15-17 degrees below zero in the winter to kill the bud, and it used to be that there would be a stretch in the winter that we would get those temperatures. I figured we would get a peach crop maybe every third year,” Cowles said.
Now, he said, “it’s rare that they freeze out.” 
Innovation is also making Vermont a more peach-friendly place. 
Farmers have used new technology to develop more cold-hardy peach varieties, Cowles said, and he now has trees that ripen at different times so that the picking lasts longer and brings in more customers. 
In Ferrisburgh, Erik Andrus has turned his hayfields into rice paddies. 
His Boundbrook Farm uses the rice-and-duck farming technique, a pesticide-free method in which ducklings are released into rice paddies. They control weeds and pests — and provide fertilizer. 
The farm mostly grows cold-tolerant rice varieties from Japan, which sits at a similar latitude to Vermont, but has recently started to grow loto rice from Italy. 
The farm once accidentally planted Koshihikari, a variety of Japanese rice poorly suited to the cold. It did eventually mature, but not until October, which Andrus said was “a little bit of a nailbiter.”
Floods and droughts appear to be striking Vermont more frequently, but the rice grown at Boundbrook Farm is fairly immune to both, Andrus said. 
The plants can be underwater for two days without being harmed, and the grains are protected by a husk that means they won’t be contaminated by pollution from floodwaters. Because the varieties can be planted in floodplains, they can get water even during droughts. 
Andrus said “flood-prone bottomlands” are the best places to create rice paddies. Vermont has many such areas, and rice could represent a path forward for farms impacted by flooding. 
He works as a consultant at Cornell University, where a team of researchers is studying rice-farming techniques in the Hudson Valley. They are also offering workshops and creating resources for farmers. 
But nothing like that exists in Vermont, and acquiring the tools, seeds and knowledge to create and manage a rice paddy without help is unrealistic for most farmers here. 
Andy Jones, the manager of Burlington’s Intervale Community Farm, said it has become easier to grow crops that like it warm: peppers, eggplants, melons, sweet potatoes. 
The member-owned farm has also seen increased yields of cold-weather spinach, lettuce and kale grown in unheated greenhouses in the winter. The flip side is that, for several weeks in the summer, the farm has had to stop growing some of those crops because it gets too hot. 
Precipitation is becoming more intense but also more inconsistent. An increase in dry periods means more irrigation is needed, and bigger rainstorms mean plants get wet and stay wet, leading to an increase in diseases, Jones said. 
Climate change has hit Intervale Community Farm particularly hard because the entire farm sits in the floodplains of the Winooski River.  
Jones said that they are used to floods, but “what’s been changing is the magnitude of the flooding.” Tropical Storm Irene and the flooding events of 2023 and 2024 devastated the Intervale area. In 2023, Jones estimates the farm lost 80% of its crops. 
In response, the farm is doing more succession cropping, or planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times. Its farmers plant crops that take little time to mature, so that if there is a flood, they have new ones ready quickly. 
The farm has been renting fields at another farm in Hinesburgh to plant slower-growing crops. It’s also moved a lot of crops into hoop houses and to higher elevations to keep them dry. 
In spite of the flooding, Jones believes the farm is there to stay. 
“The Intervale has been in agriculture for more than a thousand years, and that’s not going to change,” he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 90% of American farms take in $250,000 or less per year, which usually doesn’t leave much profit. A failed crop can mean disaster for a small farm. 
For apple trees, thunderstorms pose a special danger, particularly ones that include hai. Cowles, from Shelburne Orchards, said that hail can “in five minutes just wipe out a whole year’s worth of work.” 
After losing 80% of his main crop, McIntosh apples, to a frost last year, he decided to buy crop insurance, which has provided some peace of mind. But that does little to address the increasingly unpredictable nature of farming. 
“You used to be able to think seven generations ahead, but right now, really if you can even make it through the next couple years it will be good,” he said. 
Many farmers are adapting to the uncertainty by diversifying their products. Since 2016, University of Vermont entomologist Margaret Skinner has been studying saffron farming in Vermont. The spice sells for $20-75 per gram, according to the state, and grows in or out of a greenhouse. 
It ripens later than most other crops, meaning farmers have more time to devote to saffron’s tedious harvest. 
Vermont’s warming is too subtle to impact saffron’s growth. And even if erratic weather makes harvests less consistent, saffron has an advantage: longevity. It lasts two or three years if dried properly, Skinner said, and farmers can count on it to bring in money when other crops fail. 
Vermont saffron is also appealing to customers because it is niche. As Skinner put it, “People are really into local cool crops.” 
The cool crop factor also applies to Boundbrook Farm’s rice. The farm sells to specialty retailers, restaurants and consumers who pre-order it from an email list.
Cowles said the novelty of fresh peaches in Vermont made them a coveted commodity, as is the experience of going to an orchard to pick them. Shelburne Orchards’ peaches are so popular that some customers sign up in advance for pick-your-own days to ensure the pickers don’t outnumber the peaches, Cowles said.
The orchard also distills its Dead Bird Brandy from those pears and apples. 
“We bottle it after nine years, and that’s income that comes in regardless of whether we have a failed crop or not,” Cowles said.

Area officials marched in the parade down Broadway including Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, and a contingent of Metro Nashville Councilmembers. O’Connell and supporters wore shirts with the words, “Choose How You Love” — a play on the name of O’Connell’s transit program, “Choose How You Move.”
The festival portion of the event, held at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, took a several-hour hiatus mid-afternoon as a thunderstorm spurred a “shelter in place” order.
This year’s event comes amid increased targeting of the LGBTQ+ community  by President Donald Trump. On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed the U.S.S. Harvey Milk — named for assassinated political leader, LGBTQ+ rights champion and Korean War Veteran — would be named the U.S.S. Oscar Peterson, a Medal of Honor winner who died in World War II. Among other anti-LGBTQ+ actions, Trump has also prohibited transgender people from serving in the military.
Pride was first celebrated in the aftermath of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, in which patrons of a New York bar and drag queens fought against police who had raided the Stonewall Inn because of its same-sex clientele. Nashville held its first Pride celebration in 1989.
The festival will also be held Sunday.

RED SPRINGS —Early one evening this April, Kim Overstreet had just turned off the stove when she heard a boom. The panel box in the kitchen swung open and fuses shot out of their holders, bouncing off the fridge.
Less than a block away, Debra Duncan’s robot vacuum bolted off its charging station toward her, trailed by a blue flame.
In a home across the street, a light bulb exploded near a teenage boy, showering him in glass shards. “It frightened him so severely that he believed he had been shot,” one of his parents later wrote to town officials. It was the third power surge at the property in six months, they said.
These homes were among roughly 40 in Red Springs, a Robeson County town of 3,000, that were damaged by power surges on April 7. Residents lost appliances collectively worth tens of thousands of dollars: televisions, stoves and microwaves, washers and dryers, refrigerators, coffeemakers, HVAC systems, dishwashers, generators. Even surge protectors could not handle the voltage coursing through the electrical systems.

Officials with the town of Red Springs, which owns and operates its electric utility, have refused to cover the damages. They attribute the surge to the severe storms passing through that afternoon.
“We are deeming these losses as the result of Acts of God and were beyond the town’s control,” Town Manager Shanelle Harris wrote in an announcement on the Red Springs website April 17. “The power surges were not the result of lack of maintenance to the utility system or negligence. Our system meets modern, acceptable standards and the poles are annually inspected.”
Yet public documents and interviews show the Red Springs electric system is in disrepair. There isn’t enough money to cover major improvements, according to financial documents, in part because the town has used proceeds from its electric fund to float other government operations.
Red Springs is one of roughly 70 municipalities statewide that own and operate their own utilities. The town buys power from Duke Energy, but is responsible for the maintenance, improvements and operation of electrical lines, transformers and poles. It also sets rates and collects payments from customers.
Audits by the town’s accounting firm filed with the Local Government Commission, a division of the state treasurer’s office, reveal Red Springs routinely used customer payments deposited in the electric fund to fill gaps in the general fund, which covers day-to-day town operations, such as payroll.
State law allows municipalities to transfer those funds, but the amounts are capped, based on a percentage of the electric department’s gross annual revenues, or gross capital assets, for the previous year.
The state established those limits to “ensure electric funds are not being used to support municipalities’ general operations,” according to the town’s most recent audit.

In 2022 and 2023, the electric fund covered several months of health insurance premiums for some employees who did not work for the Electrical Department, including the town manager and the town clerk. The fund also covered a vacation payout for then-town manager David Ashburn when he retired in the spring of 2023.
“This practice has been stopped,” the town wrote to the Local Government Commission in response to the 2023 audit.
But a June 2024 audit showed Red Springs had transferred nearly $348,000 from the electric fund to plug holes in the general fund over the previous year. That amount was $101,000 more than the limit.
Since that audit, the town has reduced those transfer amounts well below the legal threshold, Red Springs’ Harris told Inside Climate News.
However, records show that even transfers within legal limits have significantly drained the electric fund.
The fund had an operating loss of more than $239,000 in fiscal year 2022, according to public documents. “This is largely due to the amount of subsidy provided to the General Fund, and inflation related to operating materials,” town officials wrote at the time.
In fiscal year 2021, electric capital reserves contributed $164,000 to the general fund; a second town account, the electric fund, transferred $176,000 to the water and sewer fund.
The storm and the power surges
Harris, who had been town manager for six months at the time of the April surges, wrote on the Red Springs website a storm with high winds caused electric lines to cross or “slap” at an intersection downtown.
A storm did pass through Red Springs that day. The first surge occurred at 2 p.m., and blew parts of Duncan’s meter base 10 feet, where they landed near an azalea bush.
Although the weather was calm, neighborhood residents said, a second surge occurred around 7 p.m., and destroyed their appliances.

Harris said the second surge happened when Duke Energy tripped a breaker at its substation. A Duke Energy spokesman told Inside Climate News that some of its Robeson County customers experienced storm-related outages at 2 p.m. and again at 7 p.m. after a tree fell on a line. He could not confirm whether a breaker had been tripped.
After the second surge, Overstreet said she called the town dispatch and told them she needed to speak to someone as soon as possible. Electric department workers then arrived at her home.
She and her husband noticed the wires leading from a pole to the top of the house had come loose.
“Every time we have an outage, it’s that transformer. They come out and fix it,” but the repairs don’t last, Overstreet said.
The Overstreets have experienced problems with the electrical system, and in one case, the town’s insurance covered it. In 2013, a voltage issue affected the fridge, Overstreet said. A receipt from that time shows the town paid $1,055 for “property damage.”
Harris also attributed the widespread damage to electrical problems within individual homes. When town staff replaced damaged meters, she wrote, “some customers were advised their homes had outdated meter bases that weren’t … properly grounded, old panel boxes or faulty wiring.”
Overstreet’s home was built in the 1940s, but she said her meter had been updated. Workers who came to the house after the surge did not go inside to check the wiring, she said, nor did they comment on the age of her meter.

The home next door that sustained three power surges was built in 2007. Duncan’s home is 42 years old, constructed in 1983. “I went through Hurricanes Fran, Matthew, and Florence, and nothing like this happened,” she said.
Property records show that with the exception of one historic home, the 15 damaged houses in east-central Red Springs were built between 1941 and 2019.
“We all had the same thing happen, no matter what year our homes were built or how good the wiring was,” Overstreet said. “We all had one thing in common: where we got our electricity.”
A former Red Springs employee told Inside Climate News that about half of the town’s transformers are capable of accommodating a higher voltage, but the rest are not. “It’s harder to get transformers for the lower voltage,” said the former employee, who asked not to be named because they still have connections to the town. “One of these days, it’s going to go down and not come back up.”


The former employee’s account matches comments Red Springs has provided to the Office of State Budget and Management. Two years ago, the town received a $1 million grant, half of which was supposed to cover electrical upgrades. To receive the funds, the town had to submit a scope of work document.
According to that document, “a much-needed electric utility upgrade is converting areas of town from 4 kVA power to 24 kVA power.”
A kilovolt-ampere, or kVA, is a unit of measurement that indicates the total energy supplied to an electrical system. When an energy load is unbalanced, equipment can overheat, fail, increase power consumption and degrade the overall performance of the system.
Red Springs would also “assess low-voltage areas and a full upgrade,” the town wrote, “and eliminate an obsolete substation and improve lines and infrastructure.”
The town received the grant in February 2025, according to an Office of State Budget and Management spokesperson, but has not yet reported any expenses.
The town’s electric fund is more solvent now because rate increases “provided significant revenues to the once-struggling fund,” according to a proposed town budget presented to the commissioners in early June. The budget calls for $210,000, within the legal limit, to be transferred to the general fund.
Earlier this month, Overstreet spoke before the town commissioners and told them the April 7 power surge could have been handled differently. “Even if you would have told us to give you a list of the things we lost, and to tell you what happened to us that day,” she said. “A little bit of respect and compassion goes a long way.”
The Overstreets did file a claim with their insurance company and received a small sum to replace the food in their burned-out refrigerator. A dryer also had to be replaced, but insurance did not cover that. Overstreet estimates the family has spent $5,000 out of pocket on new appliances and light fixtures.
“We pay the town, we entrust our safety to the town,” she said. “When I lay down at night, I used to feel reassured that they have my safety as their first interest. Now I don’t feel that at all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Red-Springs-town-hall-Inside-Climate-News-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

Jeff Landry took more control over Louisiana's public defense system in 2024, chief public defender contracts have been irregular. (Getty Images)Last year, the attorneys who run local public defender offices noticed an unexpected clause in their annual state work contracts. It dictated the state public defender would have “sole authority” to increase their compensation “at any time for any reason.” 

The provision ran contrary to a law the Louisiana Legislature approved a few months earlier requiring the state public defender to set pay rates for lead local public defenders “according to a compensation plan established by the board,” that oversees the public defender system. 
State Public Defender Rémy Starns had asked the legislature to give him exclusive control over chief public defender pay in February 2024, but the lawmakers declined. Instead, they added the stipulation to state law that requires him to use the Public Defender Oversight Board’s pay guidelines. 
Some local public defenders believe Starns slipped the extra clause into their contracts – which started on July 1, 2024, and run through the end of this month – to give himself power the legislature wouldn’t. Three of the state’s 36 chief public defenders crossed out the language before signing their contracts and sending them back to Starns. 
In response, Starns did not sign those three contracts, though the three attorneys – Michelle AndrePont of Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson of Natchitoches Parish and Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish – continued to work the past year as if they were in place. 
Their experience is indicative of a wider pattern of irregularities since Gov. Jeff Landry and lawmakers restructured the public defender system last year to give Starns more authority. The Louisiana Illuminator obtained and reviewed copies of the annual contracts of the 36 chief public defenders currently working through a public records request. 
Over the past three months, Starns has refused to answer calls, texts and written questions sent through a series of emails about this report. 
Public defender contracts are late, unsigned 
In all, Starns had not signed contracts for 10 attorneys running local public defender offices as of March, nine months into the 12-month term of their agreements. Five weren’t signed by either Starns or the applicable chief public defender, though the attorneys continued to oversee the local offices as if the agreements were in effect. 
Of the contracts Starns did sign, at least 20 were signed late. All but two of the contracts with 36 current chiefs had a start date of July 1, 2024, but Starns signed only four before that deadline. 
It’s unclear why so many contracts were not completed or signed before they took effect. The chief public defenders in question have not commented, with 21 either not responding to phone calls made to their offices or declining to talk to a reporter. 
People who have previously worked in Louisiana’s public defender system said it is unusual for so many employment agreements to not be completed by their start date. 
“As far as I recall, all the contracts were always signed,” said Jay Dixon, who served as Louisiana’s state public defender from 2013-19. “When I was there, there was never anybody whose contract was not renewed.”
For nearly two decades, a state public defender board was in charge of hiring chief public defenders and had to vote on their contracts. That all changed in 2024 when the governor and Starns successfully lobbied for the state public defender to have more control over those positions.

Starns now mostly controls the hiring of chief public defenders instead of the board. Louisiana’s sprawling public defense network includes 850 attorneys who represent 146,000 people annually, accounting for approximately 88% of criminal defendants in the state. 
Frank Neuner, a Lafayette corporate defense attorney who was chair of the state public defender board from 2008-13, was taken aback when told about the irregularities in the contracts under Starns’ watch. 
“That’s very abnormal,” said Neuner, who serves on the board for the Legal Services Corp., a legal aid nonprofit, as an appointee of President Donald Trump. “That’s your contract. That shows me poor administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Starns adds pay incentives without board approval
When hiring two new chief public defenders this year, Starns ignored the state public defender board’s pay scale he was supposed to follow. Instead, he used a compensation plan he asked the board to adopt three times in the last year but that board members rejected. 
The board compensation structure bases pay on a chief public defender’s experience as well as the size and complexity of the offices they run. For example, some oversee offices in more than one judicial district, and they would be compensated more under the board plan. 

Starns’ proposal, which the board has never agreed to use, relies more heavily on offering incentive pay to chief public defenders who personally try cases in court. It also encourages chiefs with smaller offices to run private law practices in addition to their public criminal defense work. 

In some cases, Starns’ compensation plan would cut the pay of individual chief public defenders by tens of thousands of dollars, which is a primary reason the board has declined to approve it. Starns has said he believes some current chief public defenders are paid too much. 

In August, Chris Bowman signed a contract Starns drafted to become chief public defender in Winn Parish. It stipulates Bowman will be paid $60,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $75,000 as long as he personally represents clients in court. It doesn’t give a specific number of cases that Bowman must pick up, but it appears to allow Starns to decide if Bowman has done enough work to earn the salary boost. 

Bowman could not be reached at his office for comment about his contract. 
In November, Antonio Birotte signed a contract from Starns to become chief public defender of St. Landry Parish. His base salary is $84,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $112,000 as long as Birotte personally represents defendants in murder cases as well as parents in juvenile court. 
As with Bowman, no specific number of cases is mentioned, presumably leaving it up to Starns to decide if Birotte has done enough work to receive his bonus pay. Birotte hasn’t responded to phone calls and messages left at his office. 
Public defender board members are angry with Starns for structuring contracts with his own compensation plan and not the one they have approved. They said Starns is breaking the law enacted just last year. 

“It’s our authority to approve a compensation plan,” member Adrejia Boutté told Starns at a board meeting earlier this month. “It’s still violating something that we’ve already passed.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
New contracts with more control for Starns

The contracts Starns has asked chief public defenders to sign for the fiscal year that starts Tuesday give him even more power over their compensation. 

They stipulate that Starns and the chief public defenders can terminate their contracts at any time for any reason with 30 days notice. The chief defenders also have to waive the right to appeal their termination to the public defender board and decline their right to use the board’s compensation plan. 
At the June board meeting, Starns said he would not agree to use the board’s compensation plan in any of the contracts. 

“I’m not going to have contracts that have those provisions in them,” he told the board members. 
“That’s why they were waived,” he added. 

Starns’ new stipulations appear to be in response to five chief public defenders who he is trying to oust that have challenged their dismissals. Earlier this month, a board committee recommended the full public defender board block Starns from firing the attorneys. Members are expected to vote on whether to try and stop the dismissals Monday. 
Starns is trying to dismiss AndrePont, Brunson and Ward – the three attorneys who struck language from their contracts that Starns wanted to include last year. He also wants to terminate Deirdre Fuller of Rapides Parish and John Hogue, who works in  East Carroll, Madison and Tensas parishes. 
The five attorneys have been the most vocal about opposing Starns’ policies since he first became state public defender in 2020 under former Gov. John Bel Edwards. They have pushed back on his proposed compensation plan several times in front of the board and state lawmakers. 

Starns said 30 chief public defenders have agreed to his additions to their contracts that give him more control over their pay and more ability to fire them without cause. 

Board member Frank Thaxton is skeptical, saying chiefs have only agreed to those conditions because they are afraid Starns will retaliate against them otherwise. A retired district court judge, Thaxton said some have contacted him personally asking for help. 

“The district defenders are afraid to even discuss this among themselves, due to a well grounded fear of immediate termination if their opinions get back to the state public defender. We have no protection at all other than the board,” Thaxton said, reading from an email sent from a chief public defender whose name wasn’t disclosed during this month’s board meeting. 
“The overwhelming mood is fear. I am even afraid to send this message,” Thaxton said, quoting the email further. 

Derwyn Bunton, Orleans Parish chief public defender from 2009-22, said the concessions Starns has inserted into the chiefs’ contracts for the upcoming year are substantially different from what was expected when he worked in Louisiana’s public defense system. 

Bunton is now the chief legal officer of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that fights racism and other forms of discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system. 
“It is a level of interference that no district attorney would ever allow or tolerate,” Bunton said. “The idea was to have the public defender stand on equal footing with the district attorney … and this is certainly a departure from that.”
Starns’ overwhelming control over the chiefs’ jobs could also make it more difficult for the attorneys on the frontlines of the public defender system to do their jobs. The state public defender is appointed by the governor, whose political goals often run contrary to the mission of the public defense system. 
Defendants have a constitutional right to legal counsel when facing criminal charges, but that doesn’t make it a popular choice to represent people accused of heinous acts. 

In order to represent their clients adequately, public defenders often have to be insulated from powerful political groups, said Nathan Fennell, an expert on indigent defense with Southern Methodist University’s Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center in Dallas. 

“The more that a public defender has to worry about how to keep their job … then the bigger the structural problem is … and the more the client may suffer,” Fennell said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

A new state law that raises Mississippi’s gasoline tax by 3 cents a gallon and cuts the state grocery tax by 2% will take effect on Tuesday, along with other statutes the Legislature passed and governor signed into law earlier this year. 
Mississippi currently has a flat 18.4 cents a gallon excise tax on fuel, one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. The law will raise the tax to 21.5 cents a gallon this year, then increase it three cents a year until July 1, 2027. At completion, the state gas tax will be 27.4 cents a gallon, a 9-cent total increase. 
Proceeds from the tax will go toward building and maintaining state roads specified by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
Mississippi also has a 7% sales tax on non-prepared food, commonly called the grocery tax. The tax, the highest of its kind in the nation, will be reduced to 5% in July. Municipalities around the state receive a portion of this sales tax. The new law ensures cities will receive a larger diversion rate, and be “made whole” from the cut. 
“The decrease is part of House Bill 1 that passed during this year’s Regular Session of the Mississippi Legislature,” Revenue Commissioner Chris Graham said in a press release. “We are excited to be able to administer this reduction to help provide relief on the cost of groceries to Mississippi families.”

Mississippians will also see a reduction in the state income tax rate because state officials are still phasing in a 2022 law that is reducing the income tax to 4%. The Legislature this year passed a new law that will reduce the 4% tax rate in 2027 to 3% over four years. Starting in 2031, the remaining 3% tax will be eliminated over time, based on economic growth triggers. 
 In addition to the tax overhaul, other laws will also go into effect on July 1, including:
Direct wine shipment
A new law legalizes shipping some wines to Mississippians’ homes. Supporters pushed to allow direct wine shipment for over a decade before they succeeded this session. Mississippi was one of only a handful of states that didn’t allow direct shipment. 
Under the new law, shippers must obtain a permit from the Department of Revenue to ship wine, and they are capped at 12 nine-liter cases of wine annually to any one address. The measure also restricts citizens to ordering only certain specialty or rare wines that may not be available at Mississippi package stores. The law aims to generate taxes by enacting a 15.5% tax on direct wine shipments. Some of the tax revenue will fund mental health programs.
Kratom banned for people under 21
Mississippi will limit kratom purchases to people 21 and older and outlaw more potent forms of the herbal substance. The new law institutes fines for people under 21 who buy or possess kratom and retailers that sell it to them. The measure also bans synthetic kratom extracts, which are considered more dangerous than “pure” forms of the herbal substance because of their higher potency. 
More than thirty counties and cities in Mississippi already restrict or ban kratom products, which can be found widely in gas stations and tobacco or vape shops. Any ordinances that have been adopted by municipalities or counties to regulate or ban kratom will remain in effect. 
Rape kit mandate 
Mississippi hospitals will now be required to perform rape kits on sexual assault victims who come to their ERs. A new law mandates all hospitals stock rape kits, have a provider available to perform a rape kit, and that they do not turn rape victims away.

The legislation was inspired by several cases where survivors did not receive routine treatment at hospitals, according to sexual assault advocacy organizations. 
Turkey stamps 
Mississippi hunters must obtain a turkey stamp before harvesting the wild birds, a new state law requires. The measure requires in-state hunters to purchase a $10 turkey stamp and out-of-state hunters to pay a $100 fee for the stamp. In addition to the new stamp, the law still requires hunters to obtain a normal hunting license. 
Proponents of the measure said the stamp fees would be used to maintain and improve turkey-hunting lands around the state.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24151925/3X0A5170.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

To access, click on the player above.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon in a Hartford courtroom, a small crowd of about 20 people waited to be called before the judge.
Some fidgeted nervously. None of them had a lawyer of their own.
U.S. Immigration Judge Ted Doolittle called them forward, one by one, to the table facing him. An interpreter sat to his right, and an attorney from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was on a video monitor.
Those waiting their turn listened closely to the interpreter. 
“I am looking for a lawyer, but most either don’t answer or say that they are busy,” one woman told Doolittle. “I’ve looked for them, contacted a few, some didn’t answer and some didn’t want to take my case because they were working on other cases.” 
The lack of an affordable and available lawyer was the common thread that bound this group together. 
Immigration courts fall under the federal executive branch, not the judicial branch, like most courts. And immigration cases are civil, not criminal, meaning certain due process protections don’t apply — including the right to a court-appointed lawyer. 
Judge Doolittle gave each of the individuals before him a list of free and low-cost attorneys and emphasized the importance of having representation.
“[The lawyers] are often too busy to help everyone, and it can be hard to get in touch,” he told them. But the judge added that families with good attorneys win their cases more often. 
The judge warned the people in the room to be careful as they looked for an attorney. They shouldn’t give money to people they don’t know, he said.
As Doolittle dealt with each case, setting new court dates for most, the room gradually emptied.

CT’s shortage of immigration attorneys
It’s not unusual for immigrants to go through court without legal representation. But a Connecticut Mirror investigation found that Connecticut stands out for having one of the lower representation rates in the country — and that matters when someone is trying to avoid deportation. As Doolittle noted in court that day in June, people are far more likely to win their cases when they have a lawyer.
A shortage of judges and immigration court staff, a recent influx of migrants to the United States and the labor-intensive nature of cases have rendered it impossible for Connecticut’s small community of immigration lawyers to meet the demand for representation. 
As a result, tens of thousands of immigrants in Connecticut are left without legal support, even as stories of immigration enforcement grow more frequent, from a mother taken from her car in New Haven to men detained at a Southington car wash.
Every time I look at [the case backlog], it just keeps growing again.Sheila Hayre, Quinnipiac Law Professor, supervisor at Quinnipiac Civil Justice Clinic
Even attorneys who have worked on immigration cases, like Maggie Rodriguez, formerly a lawyer with Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS) in New Haven, don’t have much capacity to take on new clients with immigration cases.
“If you are taking on this case from start to finish, you’re signing up for a many-year-long representation,” she said. “Once your docket is full, it remains full for a long time.”
That’s true not only for Rodriguez but for most other immigration lawyers in Connecticut. IRIS and other aid organizations have gathered and distributed materials to help people understand their rights in immigration proceedings and when interacting with law enforcement.
“That is all that we’re really able to offer the immigrant community right now,” said Ellen Messali, an attorney with the legal aid organization New Haven Legal.
Immigrants in the U.S. illegally — those who entered without proper documentation or overstayed a visa — have the right to due process when authorities bring a case seeking to deport them. 
But the immigration courts that handle these cases are overloaded, facing a backlog that has grown for nearly two decades and ballooned in 2023 and 2024. At the end of last year, the number of pending cases nationwide was over 3.6 million. 
Immigration court backlog
In Connecticut, more than 42,000 cases were pending as of May, before just two judges. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 20,000 new cases were added to the docket. On average, cases in Connecticut take nearly 500 days to be resolved.
“Every time I look at that number, it just keeps growing again,” said Sheila Hayre, a clinical professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law and supervisor at Quinnipiac’s Civil Justice Clinic.
Lawyers say the legal process can be lengthy and unpredictable in immigration court, and outcomes can vary depending on which judge is hearing a case. The judges in Hartford’s Immigration Court, for example, denied nearly 70% of asylum cases from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, while the national average is below 60%, according to data gathered by the research group Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse and analyzed by CT Mirror.
Since many immigrants lack access to legal representation, it often falls to judges to explain the complexities of a defendant’s various legal options.
For example, in federal court that day in June, one man told Judge Doolittle that he had hired a lawyer, but they didn’t collect evidence. Another man told the judge he wanted to keep fighting his case but had already been defrauded by an attorney. Because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was seeking to deport him quickly, both the judge and the government attorney suggested he find a new lawyer soon so the attorney would have time to prepare to fight deportation proceedings. 
“This is some good advice from the government attorney,” Doolittle said. “Don’t wait.”
Doolittle also took time to explain options to two single moms who didn’t have lawyers.
One young mother, whose daughter wore a pink dress, said she had tried three attorneys, but none would take her asylum case. The judge told her the next hearing would go forward with or without a lawyer and suggested she look into Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). She had never heard of the program before. 
But giving people extensive legal advice “is obviously not a good way for a judge to spend time,” Hayre said. In cases where a defendant’s son or daughter could be sent back to their home country, she said, judges know that an extra five minutes of explanation could end up being a matter of life or death for the child — given the threats some immigrants face back home.

“There’s nobody else to explain it,” Hayre said. “The whole thing is so frustrating.”
But even as immigration enforcement is ramping up, while case backlogs have grown across the country over the past five years, the federal government fired 20 immigration judges in February.
The number of immigration judges in Hartford recently dropped from three to two. There are concerns that immigration cases in Hartford will now take longer to process and may suffer in quality at a time when courts are already overwhelmed and expecting even more cases.
Dozens of members of Congress signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi expressing their concerns, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District.
The importance of legal representation 
Hayre recalled the story of a Guatemalan woman she represented who was trapped in an abusive marriage. The woman, mother to two U.S. citizen teenagers, lived in constant fear.
The woman’s husband used her immigration status to threaten her safety if she looked for help. 
“I have status,” her husband would tell her, Hayre said. “You have no rights in this country because you are undocumented.” 
Hayre said she remembered how he would threaten his wife: “If you call the police, I will tell them lies about you, and they will listen to me because I am legal.”  
For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, [the court delays are] really much more of a problem.Michael Boyle, immigration attorney
The woman’s husband told her if she tried to ask for custody or child support, the judge would give him custody and she would be deported.
Without access to an immigration attorney, many victims don’t realize they could qualify for protections under federal law. 
The woman was able to get legal status through a program under the Violence Against Women Act. Soon after, Hayre heard from her for the first time in four months. That was the first time that she spoke in English to Hayre.
“She told me that getting status gave her a new lease on life and a new connection to this country,” Hayre said. “Divorced from her abuser, she was now working two jobs, making more money than her husband, and her kids were excelling in school. One child was starting his military service.”
Immigrants facing removal proceedings are more likely to prevail in their cases if they are represented by a lawyer. Most do not have representation. 

While immigrants have the right to legal representation, they must pay for it themselves.
And  lawyers are hard to find.
In Connecticut, just over 26% of immigrants with pending cases are represented by a lawyer, TRAC data shows. And for those with newer cases, about 28% are represented. 
Compared to other states, Connecticut ranked 17th from the bottom for legal representation in immigration court cases as of May 2025.

That includes all cases that are still waiting for a decision in immigration court. Some cases may only need one hearing, while others can stretch over many years with multiple court dates, according to TRAC.
In some cases, it takes time to even be added to the court docket. Some people arrested at the border and released to pursue their cases end up stuck in limbo at the border. Their cases are not filed with an immigration court, sometimes for years. 
“For people with weak cases, that’s fantastic, because they often got work authorization, nobody’s going to bother them for years. So they’re picking up extra years here,” said Michael Boyle, an immigration attorney with offices in Danbury and New Haven. “For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, it’s really much more of a problem.”
At the start of the process, many people don’t have lawyers. But as cases move forward, particularly closer to a final decision like an asylum ruling, people are more likely to find legal representation. That’s why early-stage cases tend to have lower representation rates.
Cases without lawyers are often resolved faster, according to TRAC, because “without representation, more often than not, no one is available with the knowledge and skills required to effectively mount a defense.” Over time, this leaves a growing share of the backlog made up of people who do have lawyers.
For example, in the 2025 fiscal year, 74% of pending cases involved people without a lawyer, while 26% were represented. In initial hearings, 91% of cases were unrepresented, but in later-stage hearings where decisions are made, 89% of people had lawyers, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
It’s not clear exactly how many immigration lawyers are working in Connecticut. But if the total number of immigration lawyers in the U.S. were evenly distributed by population, it would be fair to estimate Connecticut has only about 200. And they’re expensive: Legal fees can range from $10,000 to $20,000 or more per case. 
With so few available, it isn’t possible for immigration lawyers to represent every client that seeks their help. 
“What if you’re a family fleeing Venezuela? How do you represent the whole family? So the lawyer is making a very hard decision of who has the strongest case,” Hayre said.
Representation and court outcomes
Representation plays a crucial role in deportation case outcomes. Among those granted relief, 97.5% were represented, while only 2.5% were not. Of those removed, only 26.8% were represented, while 73.1% were not.
But the growing backlog has placed mounting pressure on the entire immigration legal system, cutting down the time and resources available. So immigrants with stronger or less complicated cases often have an easier time finding representation — and a higher likelihood of winning their cases. 
“People in immigration court are having their absolute entire life decided in one to two hours,” Boyle said. “It used to be, up until a couple of years ago, it used to be you at least got three or four hours.”
Getting more time if front of a judge often requires pushing back, Boyle said. Otherwise, life-altering decisions are made in an incredibly short window without adequate time to build a detailed record and establish the applicant’s credibility, he said.
In Connecticut, in asylum cases from Fiscal Year 2001 through May 2025, more than 37% of asylum decisions — involving people who are seeking relief from deportation because of conditions in their home country — were granted on their merits when defendants had legal representation. In cases where the defendant didn’t have a lawyer, roughly 10% were granted asylum or other relief, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
If an immigrant gets arrested and detained, representation becomes even more complicated. Some may find themselves no longer able to afford a lawyer because they’re unable to work. 
“You think that you know what you might be doing for a client to help them one day, and then, within a matter of days, that option that you thought you have may no longer even be available,” New Haven Legal’s Messali said.
Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized.Ellen Messali, New Haven Legal
It also shifts the logistics of working a case, Messali said. Visiting clients in detention is an all-day commitment because there are no immigration detention centers in Connecticut. 
Some of New Haven Legal’s clients are in Plymouth, Mass. Others are in Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Clients have also been sent to facilities even further away, leaving them far from their contacts and their families.
“We’ve had clients get sent south to Georgia,” Messali said.
Securing bonds for detained immigrants can significantly improve their chances of success in immigration court, allowing them to be home with their families and properly prepare their cases, Messali said. When released on bond, their case returns to the court’s regular docket, giving them years to find legal representation and prepare their applications. But with so few lawyers available, it still leaves many scrambling.
Those who remain detained face an expedited process, having just weeks or months to prepare for removal proceedings. There often isn’t time to find legal representation. 
Remote hearings further complicate the process, with detainees appearing before a judge over a screen and relying on phone or video interpretation.
“While accessing clients who are detained out of state is very taxing and resource-intensive, we do not advocate for Connecticut to begin detaining immigrants in its correctional facilities,” Messali said. “We are opposed to immigration detention anywhere and want to see it abolished.”
Limited options
The supply of lawyers isn’t meeting demand because providing low-cost or free legal services to immigrants requires substantial funding, which “just kind of doesn’t exist” in Connecticut, Rodriguez said. That means fewer open positions for lawyers interested in representing immigrant clients in the state.
Back at the courtroom, one woman said she had spoken to three lawyers but was told that none had capacity to take on her case. Another woman had filed her petition for asylum with an attorney at a nonprofit who was later let go due to lack of funding at that organization. The woman was on two lists for legal aid services in New Haven and Bridgeport, but the clock was ticking on her case. She told Doolittle she’d looked into private defense but found it was unaffordable. 
“I understand that it’s hard, and there’s a lack of funding,” Doolittle told her. The judge granted several of the individuals before him an extra year to find an immigration attorney. 
People who want to practice immigration law are more likely to find jobs in Boston or New York, Rodriguez said. That leaves immigrants in Connecticut with limited options. The highest concentration of immigration cases in the state are in Bridgeport, Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and New Haven — which isn’t convenient for a lawyer licensed in Massachusetts or New York. 
And the work itself is hard. Beyond the legal complexities, the emotional toll can be profound, Messali said. 
“The work that my colleagues and I do is very trauma-intensive,” she said. “We work with people who have been persecuted, who have been tortured, who are terrified at the prospect of returning to their home countries. Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized and [face] the additional challenges that come with working with individuals who have been through this kind of trauma.”
Despite the emotional toll, Hayre continues to pursue this line of work. Stories like the Guatemalan woman’s keep her going. 
“I do this because of people like her — immigrants who remind me of why this country is so great, because of people who come here seeking a better life, ready to work hard in order to ensure a better future for themselves and their children.”
Brian Galliani, dean of the Quinnipiac School of Law, said Connecticut might consider funding a “right to counsel” program for immigrants, similar to a service the state provides to defendants in eviction cases. 
Galliani pointed to the state of Oregon as an example, where immigrant legal representation is funded by the state through a nonprofit known as the Innovation Law Lab. That organization also partners with law school graduates who can earn a license by completing a certain number of hours of supervised legal service to clients. He said that the same model could work in Connecticut.
Quinnipiac’s Hayre said while having a lawyer is ideal, expanding legal education and courtroom support for immigrants could make a big difference — by helping them navigate the system more effectively, reducing the burden on judges and ensuring fewer families fall through the cracks. 
“It may be just legal knowledge and information so that people can better advocate for themselves and put their stories together on their own,” she said. 
With the immigration court system under so much stress, and with immigration enforcement policy changing rapidly, many immigrants have a difficult choice: remain in the U.S. and face rising uncertainty, or return to a home country and face potentially life-threatening circumstances. 
Messali said she hopes Connecticut residents, many of whom are her clients’ neighbors and coworkers, can resist what she sees as misrepresentations of immigrants. Instead, she hopes they’ll try to understand the pressure many immigrants are under — and their resilience in the face of it.
“The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigrant communities in our state and throughout our country are — how hopeful, decent, hard working, giving and generous they are,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LAWYER-IMM-0314-DE-010-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Highway 50 is calling.
From home on Constitution Street in Emporia, I am within walking distance of the route Time magazine called the “backbone of America.” Three blocks to the south, the highway eddies and swirls with local traffic, those headed to work or coming back from a grocery run or, after dark, young people cruising the Sonic to show off. The highway doesn’t carry as much traffic as it used to — the interstate on the north end of town is faster if you’re bound for Wichita or Kansas City — but if you’re in no hurry and have a sense of adventure, U.S. Highway 50 is your path.
I’ve followed the highway there and back for most of my life.
It unwinds in my imagination like a rattler dodging grain trucks on a strip of baking asphalt. The highway has been the conduit for every true adventure I’ve had in the West, and when my wheels have been too long in one spot I become restless, thinking of scorching summers on the high plains and Rocky Mountain passes cloaked with snow.
Highway 50 doesn’t have the charisma of Route 66, a bygone road synonymous with American kitsch, but 50 remains the hard-traveled street of truckers, laborers and journeymen poets. Its two lanes stretch about 3,000 miles from Ocean City, Maryland, to Sacramento, California. It takes 12 days to travel all of it, one-way, according to a website by somebody who has done it. I’ve traversed most of 50, except for the first bit in Maryland, but I reckon I’ll get to that eventually. Portions of the highway, especially the lonely stretch out in Nevada, have been traveled by Jack Kerouac and William Least Heat-Moon. I’ve driven that route as well, when Kim and I returned from Sacramento one summer, and I remember watching the fuel gauge and worrying if the Jeep would make it to the next gas station. It did, but barely. Out West, poor planning is punished with inconvenience or worse.
When I was a kid, my dad would plan meticulously for summer vacation, carefully hiding a couple of hundred dollars in cash and traveler’s checks in the trunk of our old Ford and stocking the cooler with bologna. In those days — say, 1970 — average people didn’t have credit cards and most places wouldn’t take plastic anyway. I was reminded of this when I tried to pay for parking at a motel in the Texas panhandle last week and was told I’d have to use an app on my phone, as the establishment had gone cashless. This did not prevent the staff from accepting actual dollars in tips.
In those early trips with my father at the wheel it became a habit to leave Baxter Springs about dawn, pick up Highway 50 around Pratt, and drive with only the most necessary of stops until we reached western Kansas. Then we’d stop for gas someplace near Dodge City and get orange sodas from a big red change-gobbling dispensing machine. By that time it was approaching midday, and if it wasn’t yet 100 degrees in the shade, it soon would be. We didn’t drink orange sodas much at home, but on these westbound odysseys the ice-cold bottles of orange stuff became the thirst quencher of choice, abetted no doubt by the sugar jolt. If we were ahead of schedule, we’d do some tourist thing. I remember a stop at Dodge City and a quick tour of Boot Hill, a stop at the wax museum across the street, and a youthful obsession with gunfighters. Decades later, I would set a novel in Dodge City.
There isn’t the space here to list all of the locations along Highway 50 that have influenced me, but I can cite a few.
In Kansas, they include Holcomb, where the 1959 murder of the Clutter family was the germ for one of the first modern true crime books, “In Cold Blood.” Author Truman Capote, with research help from his friend Nell, rendered the “village” of Holcomb in painful and painstaking detail.
“The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive,” Capote writes. “Horses, herds of cattle, and a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.”
Now, phalanxes of wind turbines would have to be added to that description.
Highway 50 follows the Arkansas River upstream across the western third of Kansas and into Colorado. At Granada, you can see Camp Amache, a World War II concentration camp for Japanese Americans that is now a National Park Service historic site. Most of those imprisoned were from urban areas in California, and the relocation to the harsh plains of Colorado must have felt like a special punishment.
Between Las Animas and La Junta, the highway comes near Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site. Located on the Santa Fe Trail, the 1833 fort was built for trade in buffalo robes with trappers and the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho nations. The site is a recreation, but so expertly done it’s the next best thing to time travel. My favorite part? The historically accurate peacocks roaming the courtyard.
At Canon City, the highway swings around the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, where the gas chamber was used to kill 32 inmates from 1934 to 1967. It’s a working prison, and some years ago I was briefly detained by grim-faced officers who didn’t like me taking photos of the guard towers from a public street.
Leaving Canon City, the highway threads spectacular gorges as the Arkansas plunges down from the headwaters, a journey I wrote about in my book, “Elevations.” At Salida, 50 leaves the river and proceeds west to Utah and Nevada. At Carson City, the Nevada State Railroad Museum offers an impressive collection of locomotives and rolling stock. Carson City also has close historical ties to Mark Twain, who recounted his arrival from Missouri in “Roughing It.”
“Visibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad mountains,” Twain wrote. “We were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning house.”
Twain knew the appeal of adventure for the American soul, and he was drawn to the West because of his older brother, Orion, who had been named secretary to the territorial governor.
“I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,” Twain recalled, “but particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going to make (to Nevada), and the curious new worlds he was going to explore. He was going to travel! I never had been away from home, and that word ‘travel’ had a seductive charm for me. Pretty soon (Orion) would be hundreds and hundreds of miles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of the Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie-dogs, and antelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and maybe get hanged or scalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all about it.”
Twain’s racism aside, he makes a point. It is the ambition of many writers to have adventures and write home about them, I suppose. Most of the tight spots I’ve encountered while adventuring were those of my own making, while hiking or paddling, but the incident with perhaps the greatest potential for violence came on the return leg of one of those summer trips with Dad.
We were crossing western Kansas on Highway 50 at about 1 in the morning, on the way back from our first and only trip to Disneyland, and we were somewhere near Garden City. My father was driving, my mother was sitting beside him, and I was in the back. My parents had been talking about the Clutter murders, as my mother had read “In Cold Blood,” and they were pondering the nature of evil. The Hell’s Angels also scared them, probably because people were still talking about Hunter S. Thompson’s 1967 book. Also, my father — a carpet salesman for Sears and Roebuck — had been briefly kidnapped, at the point of a cheap pistol, a couple of years prior by a hitchhiking young man he gave a ride to on Route 66 between Riverton and Baxter Springs. So the anxiety in our old Ford as it sliced through the western Kansas darkness was thick.
Gradually, a car came up from the darkness behind us with its brights on and followed too closely for several miles. Then it passed recklessly, swerving and honking. I don’t know what kind of car it was, but I remember it being dark and loud. After it passed, my father slowed to allow more distance between us and the dark car.
Years have passed, and my memory of the incident is likely imperfect, but I recall us watching as the dark car swung over to the side of the road, did a U-turn, and came racing back at us. It zoomed by. Then it did another 180, accelerated, and stayed on our bumper for several miles.
My father didn’t know what to do.
Whatever my parents said at the time has been lost in memory. But I do remember my father mentioning the gun.
He had packed a rifle in the trunk.
It was a .22, a semi-automatic with a tubular magazine, the kind of rifle you used for plinking or for small game. My father didn’t own a pistol, having been frightened by them all of his life, but there were a couple of shotguns at the house in Baxter, used mostly for quail hunting. The 12-gauge pump would have been a better self-defense weapon, but the .22 is what he had grabbed, and like most things in our house — guitars, tennis rackets, runs — it was a Sears-exclusive model.
But there was little chance to park, pop the trunk, and dig the .22 from beneath the cooler and luggage and clothes. My father had asked my advice before the trip on whether he should bring the gun. He had this habit of sometimes asking me adult questions, even though I wasn’t yet a teenager. Influenced by my gunfighter worship, I had declared nobody should go anywhere without a gun.
Now his face was illuminated by the glare of the headlights reflecting from the rearview mirror, and I could see that he was disappointed by the decision. What good was a squirrel gun in this situation?
It was one of the first times I remember being ashamed of advice I’d given.
I’ve written briefly about this encounter before, but because that column was about angry drivers, I left out the part about the .22 rifle. I also omitted it because of the conflicted feelings the gun still evokes.
The occupants of the other car — and there was more than the driver, we could see that when they passed — may have been drunk or “doped up” or just plain crazy. But my father didn’t intend to find out what their problem was. The next time they did a U-turn and came back at us, feinting over the center line, my father stomped on the accelerator and the V-8 Ford lurched forward. The distance between us and the interlopers increased. They did another 180 to pursue us, but they had difficulty closing the gap.
The next town was only a few miles ahead.
The darkness whistled by at 100 mph.
It seemed for a moment the dark car would overtake us, and then when we reached the city limits they broke off, turned, and went the other direction. We fairly flew through the Main Street of the deserted town, and my father said he hoped it would attract the attention of any local cops who might be patrolling. There was no calling 911 on your cell.
The police had all turned in for the night. At the other side of town, my father slowed the Ford down, and we made the rest of the journey home without incident. For years, we would talk about that early morning in western Kansas, but we could never make much sense of it. Had it been a real threat? Did my mother’s reading of “In Cold Blood” create an unreasonable fear? And the question I still ask myself: Why had my father asked my advice on the gun?
My parents only lasted as a couple for another few years. After that, they led separate lives but oddly remained married. That complicated things when my mother died of untreated breast cancer another decade on.
I don’t know what that menacing dark car before dawn on a western Kansas highway had to do with any of what happened later. I just know in some way it did. I could feel the gulf between them widen. They avoided each other’s gaze, smoked cigarettes in separate rooms, spoke to one another in whispered sentence fragments or anguished shouts.
Some nights I ponder the incident on that dark highway of so long ago and conclude it was just an example of how inherently dangerous the world can be. At other times, I believe it has to do with the consequences of bad choices, of asking children to behave as adults, of carrying impossible burdens. My parents are both dead now, so I can speak with candor.
But perhaps it’s really a lesson in my conflicted relationship with my parents. Travel doesn’t just mean adventure, it means escape. I remember riding in the back seat of the Ford and thinking that someday my real parents would show up to claim me.
The incident on Highway 50 was so long ago now that it feels like nothing more than a bad dream. I have little insight, other than to say it remains an indigestible chunk in the soup of memory.
It did not make me fear travel. I’ve always been comfortable driving at night. But blinding headlights coming up from behind can still induce sweating, anxiety, and near panic.
When Kim and I were on our way to the Texas panhandle recently, we stopped in Pratt. I found an old-fashioned glass bottle of orange soda at a grocery store, Kim got a bottle of imported cane sugar Coke, and we drank them in the car. We looked each other in the eye, spoke in normal tones, and laughed.
The orange soda tasted sweeter than ever.

Forget plane crashes and fights about who gets the armrest.  If you survive TSA, a middle seat, and boarding group 9, now you have to make it through the flight itself without your body unraveling like cheap luggage on a baggage carousel.


Let’s start with deep vein thrombosis, or what they call the “Deadly Window Seat Special.”  You sit there for five hours without moving (thanks, beverage cart), and your blood turns sluggish, like airport Wi-Fi during a gate change.  Congratulations — you’re now flying DVT Airlines.  The longer the flight, the better your odds of a one-way ticket to the ER.  Solution:  get up every hour or so and walk.  And drink lots of water.
Feeling thirsty?  You should be.  Aircraft cabins at altitude are drier than the pretzels in coach. Humidity in-flight hovers around 10%, meaning your eyeballs are shriveling and your skin is turning into parchment.  Lubricating eye-drops and moisturizer should help.
Speaking of airplane air, did you know the cabin is pressurized only to the altitude of Denver?  That’s great but only if you’re a bighorn sheep (the 787, A350 and A380 jets are an exception).  For the rest of us, the lower oxygen can make you woozy or give your heart a surprise cardio session.  Got COPD or anemia?  Check with your doctor before flying.
Then there’s the inflight ear torture, courtesy of barotrauma.  This is why babies start crying before landing.  As the plane descends, your ears feel clogged as the pressure builds. Pop. Crackle. Pain.  But don’t worry… chewing gum, awkward jaw-stretching exercises or giving babies a bottle will probably help.  Or buy yourself a pair of EarPlane earplugs.
Crossing several time zones? Get ready for jet lag, also known as time-travel-induced dopiness.  Your body thinks it’s 3 a.m. in Hartford, but you’re eating airport sushi in Tokyo.  They say it takes one day of adjustment for each time zone you cross.
And for you frequent fliers: congratulations on your elite status… and cumulative cosmic radiation exposure.  One transatlantic flight gives you about as much radiation as one or two dental x-rays.  Not glowing, but not nothing.  Trans-polar flights leave you the most vulnerable.
Add in poor air circulation, recycled germs, and some guy sneezing in row 13 — and suddenly that N95 mask doesn’t seem so paranoid.  Still feeling like a little nosh?  Too bad.  Your guts are rebelling too. Gas expands at altitude, so avoid the bean salad.
Flying doesn’t just take you places. It slowly breaks down your body in a pressurized metal tube full of crying babies and funky air.  But hey, at least your suitcase made it to Cleveland.
PS:  While train travel is my preferred mode, extended sitting enroute is still a problem.  But at least you can get up at will and stroll to the Café Car for some over-priced AmFood.  Try the cheeseburger.  It’s actually pretty good.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/woman-on-plane-in-mask-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdraws a plan that could have auctioned more than a million acres.
The post Western public land sale axed from Senate budget bill appeared first on WyoFile .","Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his land-sale provision from the Senate reconciliation budget bill Saturday evening.
“I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock, and not to any foreign interest,” Lee posted on X. “For that reason, I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.”
The Republican had sought to require the sale of Bureau of Land Management property — owned by all Americans — to help Western communities resolve affordable housing worries. Critics said existing laws allow such sales and that the measure violated a core western value — public access to public land.
“Total faceplant.” Land Tawney
More than one million acres of public land were at stake. The provision required the government to auction the property rapidly and with curtailed public involvement.
Conservationists, hunters and anglers and outdoor recreation businesses erupted in virtual applause after Lee conceded. Opposition across the West stirred thousands to rally in support of continued ownership of and access to their publicly owned property.
“Public lands are the cornerstone of our conservation legacy,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited said in a statement heralding the provision’s demise.
Others were less reserved.
“Total faceplant,” wrote Land Tawney, co-chair of American Hunters & Anglers.
“He rewrote his scheme multiple times,” Tawney said of Lee. “And tonight? He yanked his own language from the bill,” Tawney wrote in a statement.
A coalition of outdoor businesses that claims to be part of a $1.2 trillion recreation economy said the budget reconciliation process “was the wrong vehicle for deciding the fate of America’s public lands.
“Selling off public lands in this way was not just out of touch with public sentiment,” the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable coalition said, “it could have impacted businesses, jobs, public health, and the many rural communities that depend on access to outdoor recreation for economic development and quality of life.”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a wide-ranging bill that could affect Medicaid, Alaska oil and gas development and the size of the federal debt. (Alaska Beacon file photos)The U.S. Senate is nearing debate on a wide-ranging bill that includes a series of last-minute changes that would uniquely offset or exempt some of its costs for Alaska. 
The changes highlight the importance of the votes of each Republican senator — including those of Alaska Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — to advance the bill, named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” after its description by President Donald Trump. It includes much of Trump’s agenda, and is advancing under special reconciliation rules.
In the days leading up to any floor votes, Alaska health experts said cuts to Medicaid and food stamps in the bill would devastate Alaska health care providers, patients and the broader state economy connected to health spending. Medicaid is the primary health program for lower-income Americans, and pays for long-term care for a broad swathe of families. More than 231,000 Alaskans were enrolled in May.
Murkowski and Sullivan have expressed support for provisions of the bill that seek to increase oil and gas production in the state, though Murkowski has criticized proposed cuts to health care and nutrition funding. It’s not clear how each would vote on a final bill. 
An updated 940-page version of the bill was released on Friday evening. It includes a variety of changes that would distinctly affect Alaska and, in some cases, Hawaii. 
As reported by States Newsroom and the New York Times, these changes include:

a tax exemption for fishers in Western Alaska;
an increase in amount of expenses like exploding projectiles that whaling captains can deduct, from $10,000 to $50,000; 
an increase in the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government by 25% for Alaska and 15% for Hawaii; 
allowing the Alaska and Hawaii state governments to request an exemption from a work requirement for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients; 
a two-year exemption for Alaska and Hawaii from paying a higher share of SNAP expenses; and
an increase in payments to certain providers for services in Alaska and Hawaii through Medicaid, the insurance program for people 65 and older, as reported by the New York Times. 

Alaska providers and advocates had expressed alarm 
Before the latest revision, Alaska health care providers and advocates said they were alarmed by the cuts to Medicaid in the bill.

	Preliminary research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage estimates that the bill’s Medicaid cuts would cost Alaska 3,000 lost jobs — the fourth-steepest loss among the states — and a $322.1 million decrease in the economy. 
While the bill’s drafters aim for the Medicaid cuts to save money, they will be costly to Alaska, said Emily Nenon, Alaska government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. She spoke at a news conference held by provider and advocacy groups on Wednesday.
“We need people to have access to health care before they need it … because outcomes are better, because we have a healthier workforce,” Nenon said. 
Nenon said the primary way people would lose access to Medicaid is by requiring them to report that they are working. She pointed to research showing that many who work or are eligible for other exemptions will lose access to Medicaid because they don’t meet the reporting requirement. 
“It’s not about whether people are working, most people that are going to be subject to these work reporting requirements are working,” she said. “It’s a matter of having another hoop to jump through.”
Nenon also noted the importance of Medicaid to the economy.
Alaska had 2,900 fewer employed residents in May than it had a decade earlier, in May 2015. Most industries contracted in that time, but health care grew by 7,900 jobs, more than any other industry by a significant margin.
Nenon said Alaska can’t afford the 3,000 lost jobs estimated by ISER, adding that having more people with untreated conditions or delayed treatment will also lead to fewer people being able to work. 
Rachael Miller, chief advocacy officer for the Food Bank of Alaska, expressed concern on Wednesday that shifting costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the state government would present problems in Alaska, where the state government is already struggling with the state budget and with administering SNAP. She expressed concern about the combined effect of SNAP and Medicaid cuts on families.
“So we know that food is often the most flexible line in a household budget,” she said. “We know that people do sometimes — they can’t afford their prescription, they cut their nutrition budget, because they have to afford their meds, they have to rent and they have to pay their heat.”
Also on Wednesday, Petersburg Medical Center CEO Phil Hofstetter said the Medicaid cuts would require the hospital to focus more on meeting bureaucratic requirements. And he said reduced payments would lead to cuts to services and staffing.
“I just don’t understand the premise of these cuts improving health care when the highest cost of health care comes in through medevacs, ERs, and inpatient stays,” all of which would be increased by requiring people to wait longer for health care by reducing Medicaid, Hofstetter said. “We know that prevention is a much less costly avenue for health care, and it’s better for our patients in general.”
Dr. Casey Gokey, chief medical officer of Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center, noted estimates that up to 27,000 Alaskans could lose access to health care. 
“On paper, these work requirements might sound simple, but in practice they create a maze of paperwork and confusion,” Gokey said. “Many of our patients seasonal jobs, gig jobs, hourly jobs — jobs that don’t fit neatly into eligibility boxes. They miss a deadline, they get caught in red tape and suddenly, they’re uninsured.”
Gokey said she saw a cancer patient this week who delayed care because she couldn’t afford it. She applied for Medicaid months ago, but the application is still being processed, and the patient showed signs that the cancer may have spread, Gokey said. 
“This is not a one-off story,” she said. “This is a reality of what delayed care looks like.”
Fairbanks resident Kristen Lindsay, currently working as a sea kayak guide in Seward, said Medicaid helped her survive cancer. She was otherwise uninsured when she was diagnosed with breast cancer from an MRI she received on her 34th birthday. With Medicaid, she was able to have three surgeries to remove the cancer, radiation treatment and medication.











You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’


– Kristen Lindsay, cancer survivor and Fairbanks resident



	Lindsay then got a part-time job, without health insurance, but still had Medicaid. She’s grateful she didn’t have to spend time proving she was working while she was focused on getting better. 
“You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’” she said. She noted that seasonal work is common in Alaska, and Medicaid helps fill the gaps. 
Attention turns to senators
Health care providers and patient advocates haven’t been the only ones asking Murkowski and Sullivan to reject Medicaid and SNAP cuts. 
Alaska Senate Majority Leader Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, wrote a commentary for the New York Times published Friday with the headline “Alaska Cannot Survive the Big Beautiful Bill.”
“We fear that if this bill passes, a village in rural Alaska might lose its one and only grocery store because of a drastic decline in SNAP dollars,” Edgmon and Giessel wrote. “It might also lose its sole health care clinic or hospital because it cannot sustain its services with decreased Medicaid reimbursements. The reconciliation bill does not take into account the uniqueness of Alaskan lifestyles and geographic remoteness.”
While the Medicaid and SNAP provisions were the focus of attention for some, the state’s governor focused on other aspects of how the bill would affect Alaska. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy highlighted those aspects on social media on Friday. He noted that the bill would direct 90% of Cook Inlet oil gas lease bonuses, rents and royalties to the state starting in 2035; require four federal oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain; direct 50% of ANWR receipts to the state until 2034, and 90% from 2035 on; ease other mineral leasing restrictions and require the Bureau of Land Management to hold quarterly lease sales; and target more than $4 billion for “investments in shore facilities,” including $300 million for the homeporting of a polar icebreaker.
Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill would raise the national debt by $4.2 trillion, according to the latest estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — though the official cost is 90% lower, after Senate leaders made accounting for it differently than previous bills. They did that by excluding an extension of $3.8 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans want to make permanent.

Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, joined Michiganders virtually for a Hands Off Medicaid rally in Lansing. 
While Murphy had originally planned to attend Saturday’s rally in person, the U.S. Senate vote scheduled for Saturday required that Murphy remain in Washington D.C. 
In addressing the crowd, Senator Murphy reiterated how devastating the GOP bill would be to most Americans. 
“We’re talking about 60 million people losing their health care,” Murphy explained, “most of those working Americans, a lot of them really, really vulnerable, very, very sick and disabled Americans. Many of those children. All in order to transfer that money to the very, very wealthy.”

Moreover, Murphy said, the plan has not been well-received by the public. 
“As people find out about this, they hate it,” Murphy noted. “With long-term distractions, in the first five months, we had a hard time breaking through. Well, now we’re breaking through because of what you’re doing today, because of similar protests all around the country like this, and this thing isn’t over until it’s over.”
The bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts approved by a GOP-led Congress during President Donald Trump’s first term, while also pushing through major spending cuts that would drastically downsize the federal government. 
Even if the Senate approves the measure, changes to the bill’s language will require it to return to the House for another vote. At least six congressional Republicans have since walked back their initial support, making it unclear whether the bill could garner enough votes a second time.
While Murphy headlined Saturday’s event in Lansing, Michigan leaders and healthcare advocates also spoke to the dozens who attended Saturday’s rally.

Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Healthcare, explained that this is not a partisan issue: as a doctor from West Michigan, many of his patients voted for Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Now, many of those same patients stand to lose access to their healthcare. 
As the only physician in the Michigan Legislature, Rep. Matt Longjohn (D-Portage) outlined how the proposed cuts to Medicaid would affect Michigan. 
“What it’ll mean is that there is uncompensated care, that there’s low value care, and that will break the bank for healthcare systems and hospitals and rural health centers alike,” Longjohn said. “It’s not good for patients, it’s not good for providers, it’s not good for systems, [and] it’s not good for communities.”

Longjohn also pointed out that 40% of Michigan’s budget comes from federal funds that are distributed to the state specifically to run programs like Medicaid. As such, he says the impacts of the proposed cuts would be disastrous to the state’s economy. 
“When you throw a boulder as big as this into a pond, you know the ripple effect will affect millions, and for a long time,” Longjohn said.
Beyond policy concerns, Longjohn expressed frustration with those advocating for the bill’s passage. 
“One of the things that frustrates me most is that the people pushing this are cowards,” Longjohn noted. “They will not answer voicemail, they will not answer letters, they will not show up to meetings with constituents.”
While Longjohn declined to name these legislators, others at the rally directly identified two by name: Reps. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Township).

Nearly six months into their two-year terms, Barrett and James have largely avoided town halls. Since taking office in January, Barrett has held only two town halls– both of which were conducted virtually. James has yet to hold any constituent events and has not given any indication that he intends to do so. 
The Senate Budget Committee revealed the finalized language of the bill late Friday night. The first round of votes was anticipated to begin Saturday afternoon, but ongoing negotiations postponed the start of formal discussion. 
Murphy told the crowd that each day that final passage is delayed, the bill becomes less likely to pass. 
“Because right now, this country is waking up to the cataclysm that will occur if this thing passes,” Murphy said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Republicans from all corners of Montana convened in Helena during the weekend for the paryt’s annual convention and to elect new party leadership 
Delegates elected Art Wittich to serve for a two-year term as party chair. 
“Folks, I think our purpose is conservative government, and we’re going to do some things that haven’t been tried in the past,” Wittich said after his election. “… I want to keep winning elections, but I also want us to dedicate ourselves to things that are higher than winning elections, and that’s things like truth.”
Four party members threw their hats in the ring for leadership of the state GOP — Wittich, Stacy Zinn, Tanner Smith, and Troy Miller. 
Wittich was elected on the second ballot. Smith and Miller were eliminated after the first round of voting. 
He is an attorney and former state legislator who represented a portion of Gallatin County from 2011 to 2016, and served as Senate Majority Leader during the 2013 session.
Following the announcement of his election, Wittich told the gathered Republicans that they should all seek to be a “happy warrior,” and look forward to bright days for the party ahead. 
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”

However the GOP convention on Saturday took a detour toward division when, during the credentialing of delegates able to vote for party leaders, state Sen. Barry Usher of Billings made a motion to remove nine fellow senators from the list. 
The nine state senators were censured by the GOP executive committee during the legislature over a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation including the state’s budget. 
A roll call vote among 241 gathered delegates saw more than two-thirds vote to remove the nine from their delegate roles. 
Among the nine Republican senators who appeared at the convention in person were Sens. Jason Ellsworth, of Hamilton; Denley Loge of St. Regis; Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, and Russ Tempel of Chester. 
Ellsworth told the Daily Montanan he was disappointed that the actions taken against the nine elected officials went against a message of unity that had been delivered during the first day of the convention. 
“It just cements division,” said Ellsworth, a former Senate president who was censured by the entire state Senate this year. “Republicans are strong, and should continue to be strong, but also recognize that, you know, it is a big tent, and it does take more than one philosophy.”
Loge told the Daily Montanan that he felt justified that his votes were in line with his constituents, who voted him in, as opposed to the executive board or state central committee. 
“The reason I’m the only Senator that’s Republican in part of Missoula County, and it’s because the constituents recognize I vote for them,” he said. 
With a total of 235 certified delegates voting for the party chair, Wittich earned 140 final votes and Zinn received 94, with one ballot excluded. 
Wittich replaces party chair Don “K” Kaltschmidt who served in the role for six years and oversaw a red wave through the state including Republicans winning all statewide elected offices, including the governorship, as well as all of Montana’s Congressional seats — for the first time in 100 years.
Kaltschmidt previously told the Daily Montanan that he was proud of his work turning Montana into a true red state, and that the next chairman would be tasked with leading the new era of GOP dominance. 
“It’s really up to the next chairman to take it to the next level, which would be learning how to be a red state,” he told the Daily Montanan.

Delegates elected members of the executive board including Zinn for vice chair, and Lola Galloway as secretary. 
Wittich’s tenure will last through 2027, a term which will span a legislative cycle election and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ reelection campaign. 
“I’m not tired of winning. I don’t think any of us are tired of winning,” he said. “I think when we embrace a positive vision for Montanans. They’re going to join us. They’re going to vote for us. They’re going to give us their time and their treasure, and we’re just going to keep getting bigger and better.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6314-1024x734.jpg,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468
,DC,2025-06-28 20:47:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate votes to advance Republican mega-bill in tense late-night session,"Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-votes-advance-republican-mega-bill-tense-late-night-session,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina  and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage. He said in a statement the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump in a post on social media later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans — though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”Golfing with TrumpSenate GOP leaders released new bill text just before midnight Friday that satisfied rural state lawmakers’ worries about financial threats to rural hospitals posed by cuts in Medicaid. The bill also addresses concerns by Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska about access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Paul also played.Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.Collins promises amendmentsSenate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after the procedural vote that triggered official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip the provision — which was later removed by its sponsor.GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.Medicaid turmoilProposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.Clean energy tax creditsIn what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”Alaska carve-outsProposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%. Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.Education revisionsRepublicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.‘Even worse than any draft’Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.House actionSenate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock.

She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”

Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.

Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet:”
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
“We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again,” Williams said. “Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.” 
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix))TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week.
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capitol earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The slavery monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a formal ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee convened at 10:17 p.m. Friday — over 12 hours after it was originally scheduled — to vote on a fraction of the budget areas it had originally planned and to release part of the literacy funding that is set to expire next week.  
Legislative leaders have been working behind closed doors over the last week to negotiate with Gov. Tony Evers and work out the details of the state budget as the end of the fiscal year approaches next week. 
Areas of the budget still left to take up are at the center of negotiations including the University of Wisconsin system, where Republicans have considered cuts, and the Department of Children and Families, which is responsible for the state’s Child Care Counts program. Evers has said he would veto a budget without funding for the program, which will run out of federal money soon. The committee also still needs to take up the Department of Health Services, the Department of Transportation, the capital budget and more. 
The committee co-chairs did not take questions from reporters ahead of the meeting, but as the meeting started Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the other agencies “will be taken up at a later date.” He didn’t specify when that would be.
The budget committee did approve the budget for several state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, part of the Department of Justice, the Higher Education Aids Board, the Department of Administration and the Tourism Department. Each action the committee did take passed along partisan lines.
Portion of $50 million for literacy released
The committee voted unanimously to release $9 million of the nearly $50 million left in funding for literacy initiatives that was first allocated in the 2023-25 state budget. The majority of the money has been withheld by lawmakers since 2023 and is slated to lapse back into the state’s general fund if not released by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Lawmakers said action on the other $40 million will be taken soon. 
“This has taken a long time to get here. One of the things that this bill was originally about was to make it so that kids could read. We want to help kids read. We want to give schools the tools to be able to do that,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said. “Unfortunately, it’s taken this Legislature a tremendous amount of time to allocate the funds for that, and ultimately, that’s simply not acceptable.” 
Born said he is glad lawmakers were releasing part of the money Friday and would have further motions on it in the future. He also said the delay on the funding was Evers’ fault. Lawmakers were holding the funding back due to a partial veto Evers exercised on a bill related to the literacy funding. The Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Wednesday that partial veto was  unconstitutional and restored the original language of the law.
“We’re glad that justice has been done, and we’re here now with the proper accounts and able to do these two separate motions here in the next couple of days in the committee to get this program that was a bipartisan program moving along,” Born said. 
Certain projects funded in DNR budget, Knowles-Nelson not 
Noticeably missing from the Republicans’ Department of Natural Resource motion was funding for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, which allows the agency to fund the purchase of public land and upkeep of recreational areas.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said lawmakers were missing an opportunity by not funding the program in the budget. 
“There’s a lot of individual pet projects in here that seem to be of interest to individual legislators, but there aren’t a lot of park projects that are of interest to Wisconsinites, particularly Knowles-Nelson,” Andraca said.
The committee approved funding in the budget for an array of projects including $42 million to help with modernization of the Rothschild Dam, $500,000 to go towards the repair of a retaining wall for the Wisconsin Rapids Riverbank project, $2.2 million environmental remediation and redevelopment of Lake Vista Park in Oak Creek, $70,000 for a dredging project in Manitowoc River in the Town of Brillion, $1.75 million for dredging the Deerskin River and $100,000 for assistance with highway flooding in the Town of Norway in Racine County. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), who is the author of a bill to keep the program going, said lawmakers are working to ensure it handles the program in the best way, which is part of why the funding is not in the budget as of now. 
“We actually have until 30th of June of 2026 to work on this. It’s something that Sen. [Patrick] Testin and I have been working on along with our staff over the last six months. It’s something that is a bipartisan effort. We’ve met with so many different stakeholders, so many different groups, so many fellow legislators on getting this done,” Kurtz said. “We are committed to get it done.” 
Kurtz said that the hearing on the bill was “good” and there will be “a lot more coming up in the future” when it comes to Knowles-Nelson. 
The committee also approved raising nonresident vehicle admission sticker fees, nonresident campsite fees and campsite electricity fees. 
Office of School Safety, VOCA grants get state funding
The Department of Justice’s Office of School Safety will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million to continue its work. That’s about $700,000 less than what the agency had requested, but is about what Evers had proposed for the office. 
The office serves as a resource for K-12 schools — helping them improve security measures by providing training on crisis prevention and response, grants for safety enhancements, threat assessment training and mental health training. It also operates the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns.
The Wisconsin DOJ will also get help filling funding gaps for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants left by federal funding cuts. 
Wisconsin’s federal allocation for VOCA grants has been cut from $40 million to $13 million. Domestic violence shelters and victim services organizations along with the state DOJ have been navigating the limited funding for over a year. The organizations that receive VOCA grants help people who are the victims of a crime by assisting them with finding housing, providing transportation to and from court appearances and navigating the criminal justice system.
The Republican-approved motion will provide $20 million to cover the federal funding loss. It will also provide $163,500 for two staff positions, which will expire in July 2027. The Wisconsin DOJ had requested an additional $66 million in the budget to make up for the funding gap. 
McGuire noted the funding would be significantly less than what the state agency had requested and would essentially create a two-year program rather than an ongoing one.
“[This] maintains the Legislature’s level of input, but it doesn’t actually maintain the same level of service because of the declining revenues as a result of the federal government,” McGuire said. “While we can’t fix all the things that are the result of what the federal government is doing wrong … this is something that will have an impact on communities across the state. It’s going to have an impact on people who’ve had the worst day and the worst week in the worst month of their life. It’s gonna have an impact on people who have been harmed by violence who have been in toxic, abusive relationships. It’s going to have an impact on people who desperately need services through no fault of their own. These are really vulnerable people and they should receive our support.  
Wisconsin Grants to get slight infusion, UW budget postponed 
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system. It’s been one of the key issues for debate as Republican lawmakers have considered cuts, while Evers and UW leaders have said the university system needs $855 million in additional funding. Evers has said that in negotiations he and lawmakers were discussing a “positive number.”
The committee did take up the Higher Educational Aids Board, which is the agency responsible for overseeing Wisconsin’s student financial aid system, investing in the Wisconsin Grant Program. The program provides grants to undergraduate Wisconsin residents enrolled at least half-time in degree or certificate programs.
The Wisconsin Grants program would receive an additional $5.6 million in 2025-26 and $11.9 million in 2026-27 under the proposal approved Friday. The UW system, private nonprofit colleges and Wisconsin Technical College System would receive equal dollar increases. It also includes a $75,000 increase for tribal college students.
Evers had proposed 20% increases for the Wisconsin Grants for the state’s public universities, private nonprofit colleges and technical colleges — a total $57.7 million investment.
The Wisconsin Technical Colleges System had requested $10.8 million in each year of the biennium, saying there has been a waitlist for the grants for the first time in 10 years and that list is projected to grow.
The committee also approved $3.5 million in 2026-27 in a supplemental appropriation for emergency medical services training costs to reimburse training and materials costs. 
“Recruiting volunteer EMS personnel is a challenge all over the state of Wisconsin — certainly is in my Senate district,” Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said. “We believe that this will remove one barrier to recruitment of volunteers in our EMS units all across the state.” 
Other portions of the budget approved Friday evening include: 

$30 million to the Tourism Department for general marketing, and an additional $1 million in the second year of the budget, as well as about $113,000 for state arts organizations and two staff positions and funding for the Office of Outdoor Recreation. The motion includes $5 million for Taliesin Preservation Inc. for restoration projects at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin home located in Spring Green supporting private fundraising for an education center, the restoration of visitor amenities and the stabilization of some buildings.
$193,700 to the Wisconsin Elections Commission with over $150,000 of that going toward information technology costs and the remaining going towards costs for the Electronic Registration Information Center.
$20.9 million and 147 positions for 12 months of personnel related costs for a Milwaukee Type 1 facility, which is meant to serve as a portion of the replacement of youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which the state had been working to close for years. The 32-bed facility in Milwaukee has a planned completion date in October 2026.
The WisconsinEye endowment received $10 million to continue video coverage of the Legislature.
The committee also approved $11 million for grants to nine of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes. The committee has been excluding two tribes — the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa — from the grant funding for several years due to disputes over roads. The exclusion “strikes me as inappropriate,” McGuire said. He added that it’s “an insult to those people.”

The worker’s attorneys believe their client was the first of the detained Glenn Valley employees to be released on a bond pending further legal proceedings. Other bond hearings are expected over the next days and weeks, they and other attorneys working with the group said.

The next step for the released foreign-born worker is to build a case for eligibility to remain in the country, said Bassel El-Kasaby, who said attorney Lauren Schmoke in the Kasaby Schmoke law firm represented the person in immigration court proceedings. El-Kasaby said final resolution of such cases can take years, given the court’s backlog.
El-Kasaby said the firm’s client was not charged with a criminal act. He said the client is accused of a civil offense, entering and working in the U.S. without authorization, which can lead to penalties such as deportation. The law firm declined to provide more detail without the client’s consent. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the June 10 operation stemmed from a federal criminal search warrant looking for more than 100 individuals who ICE alleges stole U.S. identities.
According to available federal court records, it appears that so far three of the detained workers have been criminally charged — one for allegedly using a Social Security number of a U.S. citizen. The other two: a Honduran man accused of brandishing a box cutter and resisting arrest; a Mexican man facing charges for re-entering the country after being previously departed.
An ICE spokeswoman said the investigation continues.
Another four people face criminal charges related to protests during the raid.
Anne Wurth, senior attorney at Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said her nonprofit is handling several of the worker cases. She said the bulk will have hearings over the next couple of weeks in immigration court to set a potential bond and future court dates for civil offenses.
“The majority of these people are not facing criminal charges at this time,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I may be best-known for my battles with pipeline companies, both Summit Carbon’s proposed carbon dioxide pipeline and the Dakota Access oil pipeline. I had the distinction of being named first in the landowners’ lawsuit against Summit’s efforts to force their way onto our land, which wound its way to the state Supreme Court, where we prevailed last year. 
It’s well-established that many South Dakotans do not care for the carbon dioxide pipeline, but the U.S. House’s budget reconciliation bill fails to repeal a massive handout to carbon companies with 45Q tax credits. This corporate welfare is why companies like Summit persist in pushing projects we don’t want. Our lone representative, Congressman Dusty Johnson, voted yes on the bill. It’s now under consideration in the Senate. 
He touted all the reasons this “big, beautiful bill” will be good for South Dakota, but good for whom, exactly? He doesn’t mention billions of dollars in 45Q tax credits at all, but cheerfully explains reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. He seems quite proud of the cuts and work requirements that will leave more South Dakotans hungry and lacking in health care. Not to mention the negative impacts on our grocery stores and small health care facilities.

As a pipeline fighter, folks may be surprised at my concern over cuts to food assistance and health care access, but I taught for over 30 years in our public schools, so I understand how budgets affect people’s lives. I also have direct experience with helping disabled people acquire that designation, and let me tell you, that is a difficult and lengthy process. It may take years for people who are not able to work to be recognized as disabled by the government. These cuts will be devastating for them. 
So when I hear that these budget cuts will help reduce waste and fraud, I call foul. Currently over 75,000 South Dakotans utilize SNAP, so these cuts will be felt everywhere. The work requirements may sound like common sense until you dig in. The cut-off age for a dependent child is 7 years; what this means is that if you are a parent on SNAP, you must work 20 hours per week if your youngest child is 7 or older, whether or not you have child care or how far you have to drive to get to that job. Or even if there is a job to be had.
We all know people’s budgets are tight, and this is reflected by Feeding South Dakota, which has reported a 15% increase in usage over last year. They are already struggling to meet people’s needs, so what will happen if these cuts are implemented? Hunger is what will happen. 
Next, let’s consider our state budget, which had to be trimmed this past legislative session. The U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation bill would make South Dakota absorb a reported $9 million to $18 million in costs shifted to the states as early as 2028 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Can we tighten our belts that much? 
If all this weren’t enough, let’s look at how health care would be hurt by the Medicaid cuts. Nearly 150,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid, and many of these folks are senior citizens and people with disabilities. If fewer people can be covered, our health care facilities will feel the pinch immediately because even though people may not have coverage, they still get sick and injured. 
As for how this will impact hospitals and clinics, this quote from Shelley Ten Napel in South Dakota Searchlight on May 29 says it best: “The proposed cuts will be especially harmful to rural South Dakota. When coverage rates fall, rural health centers lose critical funding – putting access to primary care, maternal care, dental services and behavioral health at risk for everyone in those communities.” 
Thousands of South Dakotans already travel considerable distances for a doctor’s visit, and these cuts will make a bad situation worse if closures start. Plus, those are jobs lost from communities, another blow. 
I don’t think this bill is as beautiful as Rep. Johnson makes it out to be. The pipeline companies got a rosy deal, but it looks pretty ugly for the rest of us.

(Getty Images)As voters prepare to decide who the state’s next governor should be, nearly half of respondents to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll say the state is headed in the wrong direction.
The poll found that 48% of residents say New Jersey is on the wrong track compared to 39% who say it is headed in the right direction. Fourteen percent are unsure. 
Results differed widely depending on the respondent’s political party. Sixty-three percent of Democrats said the state is headed in the right direction versus 77% of Republicans saying it’s on the wrong track. Unaffiliated voters are on the pessimistic side, with 48% saying the state is on the wrong track and 32% saying it’s moving in the right direction. 
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is stepping down in January after two terms as governor. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are competing in November to succeed him. 
Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said the right track/wrong track gap is the widest it’s been since March 2022. A poll from that month found 48% of New Jerseyans saying the state was going in the right direction and 45% saying it had gone off track.
“We’ve kind of seen this very middle-of-the-road kind of malaise of an outlook from New Jerseyans for quite a prolonged period of time now, really dipping down since the pandemic,” Koning told the New Jersey Monitor. 
Predictably, economic issues topped respondents’ concerns when asked about the most important problem facing New Jersey. Thirty-six percent cited taxes and 22% said affordability and the cost of living, while housing affordability and the economy were cited by 8% each. 
The last time New Jersey voters had a governor’s race with no incumbent seeking reelection was 2017, when Murphy was running to succeed Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican wrapping up two terms as governor. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from August 2017 revealed deep dissatisfaction among New Jersey voters, with 74% saying the state was on the wrong track versus 16% who said it was going in the right direction.
Though Sherrill’s campaign has criticized Ciattarelli for being too friendly to President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, and Ciattarelli has griped about overdevelopment of the state’s suburbs, economic issues widely eclipsed both as the most important problem facing New Jersey, the new poll shows. Trump, the federal government, and MAGA ideology were cited by just 3%, with 1% citing overdevelopment.
“Even when we see these critical social issues pop up and become more salient, they’re still, at the end of the day, perhaps not the most important or the biggest driving factor,” Koning said. “That’s how Ciattarelli ended up closing his gap in 2021 as well, by focusing on economic issues, and why the gubernatorial was so close.”
Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021 and came within three points of unseating Murphy.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults selected randomly and surved between June 13 and June 16.

The Legislature plans to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
The post Agreement reached on state budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LEGISLATURE PLANS to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, the budget chiefs for each chamber, said in a statement just after 1 p.m. Friday they completed a deal on the annual spending plan. They did not release any details about its contents or even a bottom line spending figure.
Each branch this spring approved a more than $61.4 billion budget, representing a roughly 6 percent increase in state spending over the version Gov. Maura Healey signed last summer.
While the bottom lines were roughly similar, the House and Senate budgets differed on how much money to provide to the MBTA, other education and transportation initiatives funded by a surtax on wealthy households, the use of one-time revenues to support spending, and transfers to the health safety net program.
“With this compromise agreement, the House and Senate are doubling down on our shared commitment to addressing the underlying budget challenges that we are collectively confronting in the face of ongoing uncertainty and federal funding impacts,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said in a joint statement. “Currently, our teams are working hard to complete the work necessary to file the conference committee report this weekend, to ensure that the Legislature is prepared to act on Monday to send a balanced and fiscally responsible budget to the Governor and her team before the beginning of the new fiscal year.”
Lawmakers also packed the bills with policy riders, and the weekend filing will reveal how they landed on whether to pause admissions reforms at vocational and technical schools, whether to give up some state control over alcohol licenses, and whether regulators can cap prices for some prescription medications.
The House and Senate are largely pressing ahead with spending plans crafted before the extent of changes at the federal level became more apparent.
Final approval of the state budget is now likely to occur before Congress completes its work on a massive spending, tax and policy bill. That legislation remains pending in the US Senate.
If Republicans in Washington, DC, follow through on their goals of cutting spending on Medicaid and other programs, it could force Gov. Maura Healey to make significant changes to the state budget down the line.
Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, July 1. Massachusetts has not had a new state budget signed into law before the start of the fiscal year in a decade and a half.
Michlewitz and Rodrigues’s announcement tees up legislative approval of a new budget on fiscal new year’s eve, though the state is almost certain not to have a spending plan officially in place by the time FY 2026 begins because Healey gets 10 days to review any bill sent to her desk.
Healey on Monday filed a $7.5 billion interim budget designed to keep state government funded, and avoid any lapses in paychecks, programs or services, for about another month in the absence of an annual spending plan. The Legislature broke for a long weekend without taking up that stopgap measure.
Spokespeople for both House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said Friday their branches will approve the interim budget Monday.
If the Legislature enacts the fiscal 2026 budget Monday as planned, it would be the earliest in the calendar lawmakers sent an annual budget to the governor since 2016, when they also voted on June 30.
House and Senate Democrats for years have extended budget talks into the new fiscal year and kept government funded with holdover budgets, at times producing some of the latest annual budgets in the nation.
The last time a governor signed an annual state budget into law before the start of the fiscal year was in 2010.
The difference in spending between the House and Senate budgets is $70.3 million or about 0.11 percent, the Mass. Taxpayers Foundation said before cautioning that there is also nearly $1 billion in unique spending across the two bills especially in areas like health care, education, support services and economic development.
“The House budget includes $437 million in spending not reflected in the Senate budget, while the Senate budget includes $522 million in spending not adopted by the House,” MTF said in a report last week.
MTF said that the six-person conference committee, should it attempt to fund every dollar called for in the House and Senate budgets, could find itself as much as $769 million short if budget-writers have only MTF’s minimum estimate for budget revenues available to them.
“At a high-level, the House and Senate budgets share many similarities that would ordinarily suggest swift conference resolution: both bills exclude the tax policy proposals put forward by the administration, spend less than the Governor by at least $500 million, and reflect a limited number of substantive policy proposals,” the report said. “However, despite these shared elements, budget conferees are still tasked with reconciling nearly $1 billion in unique spending priorities, a resource gap that could exceed $750 million, and notable policy differences related to pharmaceutical cost controls and admissions policies at vocational technical high schools.”
The budget deal is the first piece of legislation subject to newly reformed joint rules the House and Senate adopted Thursday. One provision in the new package requires a gap of at least 24 hours between the filing of a conference report and acceptance of it in the House and Senate, which would require the budget deal to be submitted to the House clerk’s office by about Sunday afternoon for action to take place Monday.
Under the new rules, if a report is filed later than 8 p.m. though, it cannot be considered the following day.

My first encounter with Montana Congressman Pat Williams was at a political event I was covering in Pocatello, Idaho in the early 1980s.
Williams, who died this week in Missoula, Montana at age 87, was speaking at that event. He delivered the best political stump speech I had ever heard.
I haven’t heard a better one since. It was an unabashed defense of enduring democratic values – respect for the Constitution, defense of a liberal education, support for working women and men and organized labor, an affirmation that good people in government can and must do good works.
It is said that Montana, a state I love for its beauty, its people and (until recently) its determinedly independent political nature, is really a small town with a very long Main Street. If you spend some time under the Big Sky you come to believe that virtually everyone in the fourth largest (by square mile) state in the Union knows everyone else. And it’s almost true.
Driving 200 miles to have dinner with friends or to watch a football game is pretty routine in Montana. Voters (until recently) knew their governor, U.S. senators and congressmen on a first name basis because those Montanans showed up to knock on doors, eat chicken dinners, hold town hall meetings and give local reporters interviews.
That has changed. A lot.
Pat Williams’ passing reminds me of just how much things have changed, and damn it is not for the better in any way.
Pat Williams was among the very last of a breed of Montana congressional figures who knew more about their state than they knew about Georgetown, and by that I mean the neighborhood in the District of Columbia and not the spot on the map of Deer Lodge County.
Mike Mansfield, the best Senate majority leader in history, was just “Mike” to his Montana constituents. Mansfield campaigned in coffee shops and held office hours in the Oxford in Missoula.
“Lee” was the champion of the Wilderness Act and presided over the Senate during the filibuster that tried, unsuccessfully, to defeat the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Senator Metcalf, appropriately, has a Wilderness area that carries his name.
“Max” was the guy who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and served in the Senate longer than any other Montanan. For decades Senator Baucus shaped fiscal and health care policy and then, like Mansfield, had a second act as a U.S. ambassador to Asia.
There are many others: B.K. Wheeler, a Montanan who lead the fight to prevent the Supreme Court from becoming Franklin Roosevelt’s court; Tom Walsh, the investigator of Teapot Dome from Helena; Jeannette Rankin, an advocate for women and peace who hailed from Missoula, and Jim Murray, a millionaire New Deal liberal from Butte whose political devotion was to Montana’s miners and farmers.
Until partisan polarization poisoned Montana’s politics just as it has poisoned the country, Big Sandy farmer Jon Tester, as authentic and decent as any of those just noted, was the last best Montana federal office holder in this long and now gone tradition.
  Now let us praise Pat Williams 

Pat once told me he caught more political grief for advocating changing the name of the Custer Battlefield than anything he did in Congress, but he did it. Pat, a student of history and hyper sensitive to injustice, didn’t think the racist loser in that celebrated battle deserved the honor. Now we call it the Little Bighorn.
We take it for granted now, but the Family and Medical Leave Act likely would not have happened without Pat Williams shifting the legislative gears.
He advocated for the arts and humanities when Newt Gingrich – echos of today – came after the national endowments, arguing that art and ideas could exist without democracy but democracy was imperiled when creativity and critical thinking where ignored. Pat saw the effort to eliminate the endowments for just what it was, and what it is again – censorship.
Interviewed by The Washington Post, Pat characterized the struggle to pass compromise legislation to save federal funding for the arts in the 1990s as “the most nasty, difficult and thoroughly enjoyable of my life.”
Pat said of that fight:

        Art reflects the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free. And freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.    
As Democrats wander in the political wilderness trying to figure out how to “appeal” to distracted, disinterested voters, they might go to school on the politics of Pat Williams. He listened. He showed up. He cared. He knew what he believed.
“He was always his authentic self,” pollster Celinda Lake said. “He told me, ‘I want you to know my goals. I’m engaged in a 20-year conversation with the people of Montana about the benefits of good public education and the dangers of hard-rock mining.’ And I’ll never forget that.”
Like so many politicians who have tasted the bitter fruit of what our politics have become, Williams knew that big money and poll tested positions are a huge problem. In a 1996 interview with the New York Times he put his finger squarely on our dangerous national dilemma.

“People have come to believe their elected officials and their candidates are not the real McCoy. They’re not authentic, they’re scripted, talking according to the polls, voting according to next November … It’s cancerous to our system.”
 

Williams wasn’t bashful about advocating for the public’s lands and cleaner environment. 
He knew from experience as a teacher and elected official that education was still the best and surest path to a better life. He wrote well, really well. Pat’s sense of humor – he was from Butte and had to have a sense of humor – was legendary. He was the best political story teller I’ve ever shared a dinner and a drink with.
When my much better half was working on her doctorate – her subject was women and leadership – Pat enthusiastically supported her research, and every single time I called him or shared a handshake and a hug he would say, “And, how is Dr. Johnson?”
Years ago the journalist turned U.S. Sen. Richard Neuberger wrote an essay about a now long forgotten politician who gained power and fame and then couldn’t remember where he came from. As Neuberger told the story he got off a train, the City of Portland, to stretch his legs and asked the ticket agent how he could locate a former politician he’d once known.
“Heck mister,” the man said, “he don’t live here any more. Those guys never come back to Pocatello.”
But Pat did come back – to Montana. He taught and the University of Montana, and researched, and mentored and spoke out about issues big and small. He never caught the fever associated with the Potomac, instead preferring the Clark Fork. He loved and cared about Montana, all of it.
About the only truly bad thing I can say about Pat Williams is that he was a fan of the New York Yankees, admittedly a small blemish on a thoroughly distinguished resume.
There is a lot to be said for decency and authenticity in public life. A lot to be said for knowing what you stand for and then having the guts to explain why to the people who vote.
These increasingly rare qualities defined the gentleman from Montana. Finding another like him under the Big Sky seems now all but impossible, but I suspect Pat, with the optimism of a guy from Butte, would say: Keep the faith, do the work, show up and care.
God, I will miss him. I will never forget Pat Williams and all he did. We are very lucky that he made us all better.

,California,2025-06-28 13:10:00+00:00,CalMatters,Marines are now stationed on the California border. Newsom’s office calls it ‘mission creep’,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/marines-border-patrol/,"As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it's sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border.","In summary
As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it’s sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border. 


Dozens of Marines are now stationed at a Border Patrol station in eastern San Diego County, a new development that points to the Trump administration’s military buildup on the southern border.
Some Marines there told CalMatters on Wednesday that they are out in Campo patrolling the border twice a day.  
That’s a change from how Marines have operated in Southern California since President Trump took office. Until now, Marines have been limited to a supporting role, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which keeps the armed forces away from civilian law enforcement. 
But Trump has long hinted at using the armed forces in unprecedented ways at the border to deal with what he describes as “an invasion.” 
And recently, the Trump administration shifted immigration enforcement northward toward the interior of California. Border Patrol agents have been seen chasing farmworkers through strawberry fields in Oxnard and swarming workers in unmarked cars at bus stops in inner-city Los Angeles.  
The Marines have not disclosed detaining anyone in California. Active-duty Army soldiers patrolling the border in New Mexico earlier this month reported turning people over to immigration authorities, a change that illustrated escalating immigration enforcement by military service members. 
A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force Southern Border, in charge of the operation, did not return a request for comment. Border Patrol Agent Gerardo Gutierrez said the Marines “are just staging there for their assistance along the border,” and gave no further details. 
California officials and immigration experts do not have details on what the Marines are doing at the border.  
“It’s not clear to me what instructions the Marines are being given with respect to engagement with people who are attempting to cross the border,” said Kevin Johnson, a UC Davis School of Law professor whose work focuses on immigration and civil rights. 
In April, Trump declared a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land that runs the length of the entire border as a “military installation,” a status meant to allow troops to patrol the region in the same way they protect military bases.

On a recent trip to the Border Patrol site in Campo, CalMatters reporters observed Marines’ olive-colored tents pitched atop hot asphalt with nearby water tanks for brushing teeth and washing. They have a pile of MREs, or “meals-ready-to-eat,” for food. 
Their camp is a couple of hundred yards from the start of the Pacific Coast Trail — a stone’s throw from the U.S.-Mexico border. The area is very remote.
Newsom sued to stop LA deployments
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom clashed with Trump over the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles and deployment of U.S. Marines to subdue protesters, calling it “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” Newsom sued the administration, but a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the president had followed the law and the case is unfolding at a lower court. 
A spokesperson for Newsom in a written statement to CalMatters connected the Marines at Campo to the Trump administration sending Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles inland.
“We believe in strong border security, but this campaign is not about security—it’s about fear,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo of Newsom’s office. 
“Now it appears Marines are being forced to backfill those border slots,” she continued. “This is not just mission creep—it’s putting law enforcement, our soldiers, and the community in danger.”
The military presence in Campo, previously unreported, follows an earlier deployment of roughly 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton, who had been positioned in the small coastal town of Imperial Beach and in an inland border area near Brown Field Airport in Otay Mesa. According to the Department of Defense, those troops are tasked with “detection, monitoring, logistics, and transportation support along the border.” 
Over the last three decades, the border has become one of the most militarized regions in the world, with stronger, more formidable, and taller border barriers and increased surveillance. Migrant deaths have increased as people sought more dangerous routes in the U.S., the Mexican government reported last month.
How Trump’s border mission differs from others
When he took office, Trump issued a series of executive orders, including a national emergency declaration, to achieve what he described as “full operational control” of the southern border. The orders directed the Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, to bolster border enforcement through increased military involvement. 
Some legal experts say turning land along the border into a “military installation” may sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically bars federal armed forces from conducting domestic law enforcement.

“There’s a concern that armed troops may use deadly force in situations and that people may be injured,” said Johnson, adding that military forces don’t have experience dealing with vulnerable migrants, and it’s not clear what training they’ve received. 
“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” he added. “I hate to say it this way, but it’s only a matter of time until we see something bad happen.” 
This isn’t the first time U.S. troops have been sent to the border. The Department of Defense has deployed troops to the border under both Republican and Democratic administrations for construction and surveillance.  But until now, their role has been limited to conducting surveillance, repairing vehicles, and fortifying barriers. 
The latest wave of deployments brings the total number of military personnel supporting the Border Patrol’s mission at the Mexico border to more than 10,000 – adding to the approximately 2,500 who were already stationed along the entire length of the 2,000-mile border. The number of troops at the border fluctuates as the units rotate and additional forces are mobilized, according to the Defense Department.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062525-Marines-Camp-AD-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-28 10:01:09.422113

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYO. – Sitting in an old-growth spruce fir forest, Doug Smith says he can see first-hand the impact of reintroducing wolves on the larger ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada.
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot.
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”
Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too.
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild.
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed queen of Yellowstone wolves

Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park.
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare.
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life.
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts.
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times).
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups.
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.
 The chance to observe a wolf queen’s long reign attracts tourists to Yellowstone National Park

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks.
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest.
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees.
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar.
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.
 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said.
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack.
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.
In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said.
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.
“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said.
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition.
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote.
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.

A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her.
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor.
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said.
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana.
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting.
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said.
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

Poll findings released this week from Glengarrif Group showed that eight in 10 voters – from a sample size of 800 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5% – felt that the upcoming election to select the three top heads of state; governor, attorney general and secretary of state, would be equally secure and fair. 
The results of the poll, which was conducted during the first week of June, were released in conjunction with an event on Thursday at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. The panel featured members of the Democracy Defense Project, including two former Michigan governors, a former congressman and others.
Glengarrif Group noted that nearly 76% of Michigan voters said the November 2024 election was fair, and that 88% of voters said they trusted their local elections, which is a 10-percentage point increase from those who answered a related poll in October 2024.
That said, nearly 57% of voters who engaged with the poll said they were at least somewhat concerned about noncitizens voting in state elections, with nearly 36% also saying they were very concerned about that issue.
Only 21% of respondents, however, said voters should show an ID to vote, which is already required by Michigan law, and a slim 7.7% said voters should show proof of citizenship.
That polling on some voters’ feelings on citizenship as a prerequisite to vote serves as a counterpoint to Michigan Republican efforts to get a constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship in order to cast a ballot.
The lead sponsor of that movement is state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford), who told Michigan Advance in late May that he believed 85% of the state’s population agreed that only U.S. citizens should vote in statewide and national elections.
That said, Posthumus’ aim was to put that question before the voters in 2026, giving the voting populace a chance to say whether they believed only U.S. citizens should vote in Michigan’s elections. It is still an open question if a large enough group of Michigan voters want to make that a constitutional requirement.
At Thursday’s forum to announce the poll findings, former Democratic Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard said the state’s residents should be proud of the professionalism of local election workers, regardless of the political outcome.
“As with any election, people will have strong feelings about the outcome and the winners,” Blanchard said. “One thing our poll clearly shows is that despite those feelings, Michigan voters are confident in our election system, especially the work of our local and county-level officials and the many hardworking volunteers who provide support at precincts in communities across Michigan.”
Former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler also said that the state’s voters appear overwhelmingly satisfied with existing election processes. Engler went on to say that more education was needed to bring them up to speed on what measures are already in place to ensure secure and safe elections.
“In the past few years, we have seen clerks from both parties actively engaging voters from all backgrounds in their communities – Republicans, Democrats and independents,” Engler said. “At the same time, local media outlets have covered these events and supported civic public education that benefits all of us, and we encourage them to build on these efforts.”
Engler’s comments come at a time when some Republican state lawmakers remain committed to pushing the falsehood that the 2020 and 2022 elections were unfair and are working to relitigate the outcome of those elections despite recent polls like the Glengarrif offering and other assurances through the years.
Former Lt. Gov. John Cherry, a Democrat, said the Glengarrif poll was striking because it was the first time polling has been done where a majority of voters from all backgrounds said they were satisfied with the 2024 results and looked confidently ahead to 2026 – all while acknowledging that existing safeguards were working.
“Where voters say they want to see changes, that list is very narrow,” Cherry said. “We believe that by working together, in a bipartisan way, Michigan policymakers can find reasonable, commonsense and cost-effective ways to address voters’ concerns.” 
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop of Rochester said the poll was evidence that voters of all political leanings wanted to be in the driver’s seat for local, state and national elections, and not politicians in Lansing.
That said, Bishop did say he believed that the proof of citizenship responses in an open-ended portion of the poll shows there is an appetite to move that measure across the finish line.
​​“Voters also have a real desire to ensure only U.S. citizens vote in our elections, and we encourage policymakers to explore solutions that keep our elections secure without putting up barriers that may prevent any eligible voter from exercising their right to vote,” Bishop said. 
Board members of the Democracy Defense Project proposed a solution to that conundrum: expand and support voter access to Michigan Enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses. Both forms of enhanced identification indicate if someone is a U.S. citizen and are compliant with new federal requirements for REAL ID, which allow access to federal buildings, boarding planes and traveling domestically by air and other activities. 
In late May, the Michigan Department of State said it had issued 200,000 REAL IDs in the last few months.
A REAL ID differs from Enhanced ID in that it does not indicate U.S. citizenship, so a pathway to getting the latter could ease citizenship and voting concerns.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Democracy-vote-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would have limited high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less, which advocates said would have protected against predatory lending. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 39, passed both the Alaska House and Senate this session, and would have removed payday lenders from a state exemption in lending laws, and placed a cap on interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate of 36% for customers paying back these loans. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans often for small amounts that are meant to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday.
In a short memo issued with the veto on Wednesday, Dunleavy cited access to credit and compliance requirements, issues argued by opponents of the measure.
“These changes would reduce short-term credit options – particularly for those without access to traditional banking services – while creating enforcement challenges for the state,” Dunleavy wrote. 
The veto was condemned by a sponsor of the bill.
“I’m very disappointed in the veto. This was a bipartisan bill,” said Rep. Ted Eischeid, D-Anchorage, who introduced the bill in the House, in a phone interview on Friday. He pointed to the fact that payday loans are highly convenient and accessible online, leaving borrowers with high-interest loans that they struggle to repay. 
“It’s easy to get these payday lending loans. But the problem is, people get the loans. They have two weeks to pay them off. They’re charged fees plus interest rates, and oftentimes they can’t pay those,” he said. “They create debt traps.”
Interest rates and fees in Alaska can range from 194% to 521%, according to research by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Eischeid noted 18 other states have enacted a cap on interest rates and fees at 36% annual percentage rate, and other banks lending institutions provide emergency loans. “Those states, red and blue, have not had credit crises,” he said.
In 2023, there were 7,085 Alaskans that took out payday loans totaling $17.4 million, according to the state’s Division of Banking and Securities, with loans averaging $440 and each borrower taking out an average of 5.5 loans. 
Eischeid said Alaskans are also targeted by lenders, who can garnish their Permanent Fund dividend checks. “And so when Alaskans can’t pay these debt trap loans, the payday lenders simply go to small claims court and garnish their PFDs,” he said. “It’s a cash cow for payday lenders.”
From 2017 to 2023, payday lenders garnished over $3.7 million from Alaskan’s PFDs, according to court data compiled by Eischeid’s office. 
He said he wished Dunleavy had identified enforcement concerns earlier, as his office worked with the Division of Banking and Securities in drafting the bill to identify any potential issues. “Because we asked, ‘What kind of heartburn is this going to cause the state in terms of enforcement and regulation?’ And they said none,” he said. “I’m confused by that.” 
The Online Lenders Alliance, a national trade organization for financial technology groups that offer online banking services, applauded Dunleavy’s veto. “Governor Dunleavy made the right choice for Alaska consumers by vetoing this flawed legislation,” said the group’s CEO Andrew Duke in an emailed statement. “The ability to access credit is the cornerstone of financial independence and stability.  Unfortunately, SB 39 would have taken away credit options and financial choices for Alaskan consumers and small businesses.” 
The Alaska Public Interest Research Group criticized the veto, saying it’s a failure to protect Alaskans from predatory lending. “This bill is a commonsense, multipartisan effort to end a debt trap that has harmed our communities for over 20 years,” said Claire Estelle Lubke, AKPIRG economic justice lead, in an email. “Instead of siding with Alaskans, the Governor chose to protect an industry that profits from financial insecurity. Payday loans are not an acceptable form of credit for our communities.”
The group is calling for the Legislature to vote to override veto next January and limit what they call a predatory loan industry. 
Eischeid said it’s a possibility. “​​Those discussions have to happen yet. But it’s a good bill, it was a good bill. It works in states where they’ve gotten rid of the special treatment payday lenders get. And I would like to see this effort be successful.”

(Photo courtesy Maryland Municipal League/CGI)Pocomoke City Mayor Todd Nock wants to take the Maryland Municipal League “back to the future.”
Nock, who took over presidency of the league this week, made the comments after being handed the gavel by Frederick Mayor Michael O’Connor, the outgoing president. In his first speech as president, Nock reminisced about his younger self and about the people who nurtured him, before challenging his fellow mayors and city leaders to work to develop the next generation of leaders.
“This year, Maryland Municipal League is going back to the future. Back to our communities. Back to building the next generation of leaders,” Nock said, according to text of his speech provided by the league. “We’re going to be present. We’re going to show up.
Because here’s the reality—we won’t be elected forever. Our job is to prepare, teach, and nurture not just our youth but also support our elders and entire communities,” he said. “It is time to go back home and be who the people elected us to be.”
Nock went on to tell the municipal officials assembled in Ocean City for the league’s annual summer conference that he did not want to be in their communities just “when you polish statues and cut ribbons. I want to be there when you’re hosting community events, when you’re connecting with residents, and when you’re doing the hard work that truly matters.”
Nock will serve a one-year term as president. While he was elevated to the presidency Tuesday, Bladensburg Mayor Takisha James was elected to replace his as president-elect, and will serve once Nock’s term ends.
Dashboard data targets gun violence
The Maryland Department of Health launched new data on gun violence statistics that health officials say will help track trends in gun violence and find solutions to reduce those numbers.
“As someone who has served as a surgeon in emergency departments in Maryland, I have personally seen how Maryland families and communities suffer from the impact of gun violence and its resulting trauma,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani told reporters Thursday. “Our ultimate goal with these resources is to develop … data-driven solutions that will save the next life, that will protect the next family and that will heal our communities,” she said.

	The dashboard includes a decade of fatal and nonfatal shooting statistics, updated monthly to have “almost a real-time assessment of what gun violence looks like at the state, county and ZIP code level,” Seshamani said. It also includes the number of homicides and suicides related to firearm use.
From Jan. 1 through April, there had been 187 deaths due to firearms, according to the dashboard. About 54% of those deaths were suicides.
In addition to the dashboard, the department released a preliminary state plan to develop a public health approach to lower gun violence. Besides incorporating dashboard data, the plan calls for increased education efforts for effective gun violence prevention strategies and improved coordination between state agencies and local jurisdictions to bring down gun violence.
“It’s always important for us to remember that these statistics — they’re not just numbers,” Seshamani said, “They are real people. They are real victims of a public health crisis.”
You can’t be in the minority if you’re the only one…
Months after frustration of being in the minority drove Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) to say he would not run for reelection, the freshman Republican has modified that statement a little.
He will not seek election to a seat in the House of Delegates. He will seek election to an office on the second floor of the State House — the governor’s office.
Bouchat has not yet formally filed for the office, but confirmed his intention to run for governor, first reported by last week by the Baltimore Sun. While he has not filed the paperwork, Bouchat said he intends to start running ads thiis weekend on Fox45 in Baltimore, not actually pitching his candidacy but urging people to visit  Maryland’s many historic sites. It’s a version of the short video on his delegate site, quickly rebranded to a “Bouchat for Governor” page.

Bouchat said he decided to walk away from the House after one term because of the “super minority status” of Republicans in Maryland, who hold just 28% of seats in both the House and Senate,.
“It’s pretty much hopeless to be a Republican in the Maryland General Assembly,” Bouchat said. “Maryland has been under a legislative dictatorship by the Democratic Party for 105 years.”
He blames that on gerrymandering of legislative districts. Which got him to thinking about the goveror’s race.
“On a governor level, it’s not gerrymandered — it’s statewide,” Bouchat said.
His biggest goal, if elected, is to create a solution to gerrymandering
“What I’m offering is historical,” Bouchat said. “This is going to be one of the greatest political science accomplishments in the history of the world.”
If he files, Bouchat would not be the first Republican to throw his hat in the ring for the governorship: John Myrick and Brenda Thiam are already filed for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Political observers are waiting to see if two-term GOP Gov. Larry Hogan will run for his old seat. And the Republican nominee will likely have to take on Gov. Wes Moore (D), a fundraising juggernaut in a deeply blue state.
While he has not officially filed, Bouchat has until February to sign up.
“I’m in no great hurry,” Bouchat said. “It’s a bit of a strategy to watch it all unfold.
Burd steps up at state retirement system
Robert “Bob” Burd, the deputy chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, will step up next week to serve as acting CIO, the system’s board of trustees announced.
Burd will take over as interim chief on July 1, with the retrirement of current Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer, who has served in that role since 2015. The interim appointment of Burd was announced at the trustees June 17 meeting.
Burd has served as deputy chief investment officer since 2011, helping shape “asset allocation strategy, managing investment risk and overseeing manager selection across the $70 billion portfolio,” according to a news release from the system.
“Bob brings a deep understanding of our portfolio and a steady, principled approach to leadership,” said Executive Director Martin Noven. “He has earned the trust of the Board and I’m confident in his ability to lead the division with focus and integrity during this transitional period.”
Burd served as acting CIO once before, and system officials said his appointment now ensures uninterrupted leadership.
“Bob has worked side-by-side with our team to deliver long-term value for our members,” said State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Chair of the SRPS Board of Trustees. “We are fully confident in his ability to guide Maryland’s investment program during this interim period.”
The board said that under Palmer’s tenure, the system “achieved consistent outperformance, expanded internal asset management capabilities, and implemented strategic reforms across public and private markets. Burd has been instrumental in advancing these efforts and will provide continuity and stability during the leadership transition.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54613600036_900624f396_o-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

(Photo by Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)In conjunction with other southern states, Florida is developing a new university accrediting commission in response to existing agencies the governor says require schools to “bend the knee” to get accredited.
During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative.
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized.
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation.
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”



Why is USC involved?
Thad Westbrook, board president for the University of South Carolina, joined Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as well as leaders of state schools in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, at this week’s news conference announcing the initiative to form a new accreditation agency.
Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
But Westbrook sidestepped such rhetoric in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership. 
Rather than criticize the accrediting agency for anything specific, he described accreditation and re-accreditation, which colleges must go through every five years, as “a very burdensome process.”
He told the SC Daily Gazette that USC could benefit from an accreditation agency tailored to large state college systems, “more peer-to-peer instead of a one-size-fits all” organization that covers the entire region. By joining this partnership, South Carolina’s largest university will have a seat on the governing board as it creates its standards for accreditation.
Westbrook said he wants to see standards focused on student outcomes. In particular, he wants to see increases in the number of students who graduate college within four years or less, progressing through as quickly as possible and entering the workforce.
He said he thinks some accreditation agencies stray from what’s required under the federal Higher Education Act. He said the new agency will still have rigorous standards but won’t go beyond what the law demands.
Westbrook said the costs of applying to become an accrediting agency will be borne by the state of Florida. If the accrediting agency gets federal approval, USC will only pay a membership fee if its governing board votes to leave SACS and apply for accreditation through the new organization.
For USC faculty, the impact of the arrangement is less clear. 
Faculty Senate President Wayne Outten, who teaches biochemistry, said professors and researchers are typically less concerned about which accrediting agency a college uses. When deciding whether to apply for a job, they usually weigh a college’s reputation, salaries and resources for research.
But with so few details available on the new agency, possible effects are unknown at this time.

 Timeline

DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it.
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency.
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
 Expecting favorability

“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said.
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive.
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System.
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position.
 Union backlash

The Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida released a joint statement following DeSantis’ announcement, saying they “strongly oppose” the move as “directly threatens the independence, integrity, and academic credibility of the state’s higher education system.”
“Accreditation matters because it’s the backbone of academic freedom, shared governance, and public trust in the quality of our institutions,” UFF President Teresa M. Hodge said in a news release.
“This proposed state accreditor appears designed to align more with political priorities rather than academic independence. It seems to be the state’s latest attempt to exert top-down control over what faculty can teach and what students are allowed to learn.”
Andrew Spar, president of the FEA, said he is concerned about how a new accreditor might affect teacher preparation programs.
“Students learn best when they’re free to learn and educators are free to teach — not when curriculum decisions are dictated by politics,” Spar said.



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last spring Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo posted a photo of his daughter Vera wearing a baby blue mermaid-style dress with puffy sleeves and a train. She had designed it on her own so, certainly, as a fashion designer who didn’t hesitate to make a gown for a loved one, he made her vision come true. 
On Friday, Vera wore that gown again while singing for hundreds during the celebration of life Ah Loo’s friends and family organized after he was tragically wounded during the “No Kings” rally June 14. Many joined Vera in donning the tributes to the renowned designer’s style, wearing geometrical prints, flowers, formal wraparound skirts known as ie faitaga, sleek hairstyles, and so, so many of Ah Loo’s gowns.  
Laura Ah Loo, his wife, wore a flowy, green dress adorned with a yellow lei. It was one of the best dresses of the night, Telesia Afeaki Tonga, the event’s emcee said, because she was one of his main sources of inspiration. Laura’s voice cracked as she thanked family, friends and fellow protesters for all the love they had received in the last weeks.

“Losing Afa feels like losing the sun, our light, our warmth and our comfort,” Laura Ah Loo said. “It is more devastating than I can ever put into words, because no amount of words can encompass who he was as a person and who he was to me and our babies.”
Ah Loo’s big community gathered at the Salt Palace Convention Center’s grand ballroom, a room as big as the presence he had in the Pacific Islander communities in Utah and beyond.
“Of course it had to be in a grand ballroom, like only he would have. Absolutely extra,” Tonga said.

Ah Loo’s participation on “Project Runway” in 2019 expanded his presence in the fashion industry. However, being the first Samoan to participate in the show, among many other feats, made him a point of reference in Polynesian communities. After moving to Utah, he continued weaving his legacy, mentoring anyone with a creative pursuit and supporting the state’s Pacific Islander community though a nonprofit he co-founded, Creative Pacific.
While his job took him to other cities and countries, his greatest joy wasn’t on a runway, but at home with his family, his wife said. And sometimes, at McDonald’s with a large Coke. 
“I will miss taking sips of his drinks because I never wanted to order my own, his constant eye rolls at my antics and hearing him speak Samoan, his beautiful singing voice,” Laura Ah Loo said. “And, as he called it, his hyena laugh. But to me, it was the best sound in the world.” 
Beloved Utah fashion designer’s friends remember his life and his last moments

After her loss, Laura Ah Loo has been planning to continue her husband’s work and legacy, a task that now seems impossible to equally replicate. But, she still sees parts of him every day, in their kids’ brown eyes, creativity, “healing hugs,” and “larger than life” personalities, all attributes they share with Ah Loo. Also in the remaining fingerprints he left behind and his voice in all the videos saved in their phones. 
Just like Ah Loo did after his fashion shows, Laura Ah Loo walked along a runway, holding Vera’s and her son Isaac’s hands while friends and family gave a standing ovation. 
June 14 remains a painful day for his family. But Laura Ah Loo still finds inspiration in the sign he held that day, which read “The world is watching.”
“They were watching then, and they’re watching, certainly watching now. The world is watching how we carry his light, how we treat each other, how each keep choosing love in the face of unthinkable loss, how we raise our children, how we fight for joy in spite of hard times,” she said. “He will not be forgotten.”
Others also took the stage to perform a musical number or a dance, often included in Polynesian funerals, or to tell stories of Ah Loo’s life as a beloved mentor, friend and brother, distinguished by his sense of humor, sarcasm and kindness.

“I see all your posts about him. I see all your tributes about him, and how I’ve sat down several times to write something about him, but I can’t,” his sister Ofeira Asuao said. “There’s just no words for me to explain the impact that he’s had.”
While Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson never met Ah Loo, she said in her remarks that she has come to know his spirit through the love and admiration shown by the community he helped shape. 
“I personally am inspired to continue the work he cared about, advocating for equality, embracing creativity and fostering a stronger and more compassionate community for his Pacific Islander friends and beyond,” Wilson said. “Afa, may your light continue to shine and may others be inspired by your fearless advocacy, your life’s mission, love of friends and family and your creative spirit.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Afa-Celebration_SH_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through COVID, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.
  Josephine Rios, who works in nursing at Kaiser Permanente in California, was among the Service Employees International Union members who gathered outside the U.S. Capitol. She worries that potential Medicaid cuts could cause her to lose her job and cause her grandchild, on Medicaid because of a disability, to lose his coverage. (Phil Galewitz/KFF Health News)
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

Michigan’s top election official is locked in a clamorous legal battle with Republican lawmakers over access to election training materials, a conflict that likely has less to do with policy than politics — and the coming race for governor.
And if the battle continues at its current volume, voter trust in Michigan’s elections could take a beating.
On one side is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who won her 2022 re-election race by nearly 14 percentage points and is now a leading Democratic candidate for governor. Since 2019, she has been a key part of the Democratic power structure in the executive branch and the face of election oversight in a swing state that became a target of heavy scrutiny and conspiracy theories after Donald Trump’s 2020 loss.
On the other side is the Michigan state House, back under Republican control since January, which has subpoenaed her, sued her, and even made moves to impeach her.
Leading the charge there is Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican and former township clerk from Martin who took over in January as chair of the House Committee on Election Integrity. For several months, she has been seeking access to the Department of State’s election training portal to check for “flawed guidance.” Benson and her office have been pushing back.
With each day, the confrontation over election manuals looks more and more like a mobilization for next year’s political campaigns, where Republicans hope to retake the governor’s mansion after eight years of being shut out of statewide office. Benson is one of the people who stand in the way.
Smit hasn’t identified specific concerns about the content of the training manuals, but has instead cited what she calls a “concerning track record” of illegal guidance from Benson, based on the fact that Benson’s office has faced many election-related lawsuits, and has lost some of them.
“The Michigan House Committee on Election Integrity has a duty to provide oversight,” Smit told Votebeat. “We seek to review the training materials to ensure MDOS is properly training clerks on the law.”
Benson’s office has not provided access to all the documents upon request, citing concerns over information security. That has prompted an escalating series of steps by the Republicans to challenge Benson for the access, and countermoves by Benson to defend her office’s response.
Their dispute is now before the Michigan Court of Claims, which has set deadlines for filing legal briefs, though an actual resolution could be weeks away. Meanwhile, both sides are using the fight as fodder for fund-raising appeals.
 Conflict heats up after power shift in the House

The conflict has simmered for months, but escalated after Republicans reclaimed the House in November’s election. That’s when Smit requested access to the state’s election training portal, which provides manuals and tools for local officials.
Smit said the Department of State initially couldn’t fulfill her request. She then filed a public-records request and was told it would require 140 hours and nearly $9,000 to fulfill — a cost she called “ridiculous.”
Shortly after, Smit was named the chair of the House election committee, newly renamed the Committee on Election Integrity. She then sent another request for the information, which the Department of State said it would fulfill in part. But the requested documents never came. At Smit’s request, the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for the documents.
Republicans say the subpoena was necessary to ensure the balance of power in Michigan government. Smit’s office did not respond to Votebeat questions on what specific concerns prompted the inquiry.
Benson, whose office also handles motor vehicle services, has faced numerous challenges to her guidance and conduct of elections — more election lawsuits than her last four predecessors combined. But her record is better than that of past secretaries from both parties. A review by the Michigan Information & Research Service found that while Benson has lost some election-related lawsuits, she has won significantly more cases than her predecessors.
Several cases have had mixed rulings, like a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee over voter signatures on absentee ballots, where part of Benson’s guidance was struck down while other pieces were allowed to remain in place. Out of 69 total cases since 2019, Benson’s office had five “losses,” according to the MIRS analysis.
Department of State spokesperson Angela Benander said the cost estimate the department gave Smit after the November request followed state Freedom of Information Act requirements, including producing the records and redacting sensitive sections. “We are now well above that,” she said, noting that more than 20 staff members have worked on it over recent weeks.
The Department of State said it made multiple offers to provide the requested materials securely with redactions, but the Oversight Committee rejected them. The subpoena sought information that could jeopardize election security, Benander told Votebeat in April, by risking the chain of custody of ballots and revealing specific locations for trainings for election officials, among other concerns. Election workers across the state have faced threats of violence in recent years.
The department then went public, posting information about the documents it had already shared with lawmakers. Benson reiterated the department’s position that releasing sensitive information could jeopardize election security.
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned,” she said in May. “Each time sensitive information is released, its risk of misuse increases.”
Since then, she has issued regular updates, sharing more documents, doubling down on security concerns, and preparing for a legal showdown.
Republicans have also escalated: On May 22, the House voted along party lines to hold Benson and the entire Department of State in contempt. On June 3, Rep. Jim DeSana, a Republican from Carleton, introduced articles of impeachment against her in a House resolution, alleging that she abused her authority, mishandled records, and intimidated local officials in the way she oversaw the state’s elections.
Then, earlier this month, the House Oversight Committee sued Benson and her department, alleging they were refusing to provide the training documents “in their irrational and even conspiratorial objections to the House Subpoenas.”
Benson said in a statement that she welcomed the suit as a chance to resolve the matter in court.
 What will voters make of the Benson vs. GOP fight?

While the battle has been useful for driving fund-raising campaigns — for both Benson and the Republicans — it’s unlikely to swing any votes so far out from an actual election, David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University, told Votebeat.
The House GOP effort might be intended to damage Benson’s campaign, he said, “but the people who they would want to persuade aren’t paying attention. They have other stuff to worry about.”
Jeffrey Bernstein, a political science professor at Eastern Michigan University, agreed. Those who are most tuned in to politics probably have already formed their opinions on how Michigan’s elections are run, he said.
“People are going to start paying attention soon enough,” he said, “but there will be other things happening then to occupy their attention.”
Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson, a political science professor at Wayne State University, worries, though, that such a pitched conflict in Lansing could have a lasting effect for people who aren’t so tuned into politics by casting a “vague and hazy” cloud over elections.
Even this far out from an election, she told Votebeat, “when you start casting doubt on integrity, public trust suffers.”
The best case scenario, Sarbaugh-Thompson said, is a quick ruling from the courts to quiet the entire issue. But she doesn’t expect quiet anytime soon.

Dorie Ladner was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She and her sister, Joyce, became involved early with the civil rights movement, working with Medgar Evers, Vernon Dahmer, Clyde Kennard and others. 
She and her sister were kicked out of Jackson State University for their support of the Tougaloo Nine, who integrated the all-white library in downtown Jackson. They became even more active at Tougaloo College. They worked with the Freedom Riders, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped with the 1963 March on Washington. 
Dorie escorted Fannie Lou Hamer to register to vote. Joyce pursued graduate school, earning a doctorate in sociology, becoming the first female president of Howard University. Dorie continued her civil rights work, participating in every major civil rights march through 1968. In Washington, D.C., she earned her master’s in social work, counseling emergency room patients, visiting schools and working with the Rape Crisis Center. 
The sisters were honored at the Kennedy Center, and Dorie received the Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy Humanitarian Award. A decade before her death in 2024, she received an honorary doctorate from Tougaloo.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat.
While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February.
Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year.
PSC Chair Fred Hoover said the commission spoke with utilities — which will actually dole out the rebates to customers — as well as ratepayer advocates and its own staff, to come up with the best plan for handing out the money.
The commission “has selected a plan that will allow for the most equitable, efficient and timely distribution of refunds to provide relief to customers, particularly those most affected by bill increases this past winter,” Hoover wrote.
The refund payments will show up as credits on ratepayers’ bills and will be based on a customer’s usage over a year, with those who use more energy getting a larger rebate. But the PSC also directed utilities to disburse 25% of the money evenly across all ratepayers, to ensure all customers get a baseline amount.
The PSC also advised utilities to advertise ways for customers to donate their rebate to others if they choose, including to the Fuel Fund of Maryland or SMECO’s Members Helping Members program. For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

The rebates were authorized by legislators as part of the Next Generation Energy Act, a wide-ranging bill that also included a regulatory fast-track for new power plants and other energy infrastructure in the state.
Lawmakers tapped $200 million to pay the rebates from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities if they do not purchase a specified amount of renewable energy for their portfolios. The fund has ballooned in recent years.
During a news conference Wednesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) referenced this week’s high temperatures, which flirted with 100, and their impact on already soaring bills.
“I have an HVAC repair person coming tomorrow,” Ferguson said. “So we are personally dealing with the challenges of what I know a number of Maryland families are, which is unbelievably hot weather, and then the resultant impact on people’s bills, which feels like a double hit. I am as frustrated as anyone.”
High utility bills were a major topic of conversation for the 2025 legislature, following high costs during a cold winter, thanks in large part to higher natural gas distribution rates. But now, electricity rates are poised to increase as well for the delivery year that began in June.
The increases will hit different customers at different times: June 1 for SMECO customers, August for Pepco and Delmarva Power customers, and October for Potomac Edison. BGE, which will have the highest increases, was ordered by the PSC to spread them over three months this fall and again next spring, in order to dull the impact in the high-use summer and winter periods.
Moore signed the Next Generation bill and one other energy bill, but vetoed the Energy Resource Planning Act, which would have set up an in-house energy planning office for state government. He recently critiqued the Next Generation law, saying it did not go far enough to attract power generators to build in Maryland.
“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”
Ferguson pushed back this week.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I don’t know what the governor was talking about when he said that. I genuinely have no idea what he was referencing,” Ferguson said during his news conference. “I think that we did incredibly important work to make it easier for all sorts of cleaner energy, from natural gas to wind to solar to geothermal to batteries.”
He said Moore’s nuclear bill would have increased costs for ratepayers, which “was not something that we were going to tolerate. So, what we did was incorporate components of the governor’s bill into the Next Generation Act.”
The bill directs state agencies to pursue nuclear cost-sharing agreements with neighboring states and agreements with federal agencies about nuclear siting, including for small modular reactors.
The fiscal note for Moore’s bill said that “in the short term, the bill appears likely to increase electricity rates,” because it increased the amount utilities would have to pay the state to comply with a solar energy goal. It also established a nuclear energy procurement mechanism that would be funded by ratepayers.
But legislative analysts said the governor’s bill had “the potential to provide other benefits to the broader energy market and eventually reduce associated electricity rates paid by customers in the State.”
Ferguson was also quick to note that increasing power generation in the state isn’t a cure-all. Maryland is part of a 13-state region whose electrical grid is controlled by PJM Interconnection, which has been criticized for policies that make it difficult for new power sources — particularly renewable — to come online at a time of surging demand.
“Generation is a problem within the PJM territory, for all 13 states, and even in states that are net exporters, that generally are sending their energy to other states,” Ferguson said. “This, sadly, is not a problem that we can fix in a day, a week or a month.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 08:04:05.007854
