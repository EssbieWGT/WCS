Lauren Boebert speaks to supporters during an election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024 in Windsor, Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican, is one of just four Republicans in Congress supporting efforts to force a floor vote on releasing U.S. Department of Justice case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
Legislators leading the effort have said a petition that would force a vote on a resolution requiring the full release of the Epstein case files has enough signatures to pass, but allies of President Donald Trump continue to oppose a floor vote on the issue.

The resolution, led by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was introduced before Congress went into recess, but House Speaker Mike Johnson let the members go early to avoid a vote on the resolution. 
Boebert, the only Colorado Republican to sign the petition, has long sought an aggressive Epstein investigation and called for a special counsel to take the case this summer. The four Republicans who signed the discharge petition are Boebert, Massie, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.  
All four Colorado Democrats in the House — U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood — signed the petition.
The government’s investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse has dogged and splintered House Republicans since July, when Trump’s administration declared it would not share any further information on the powerful and well-connected financier, with whom Trump was friends. Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. 
Boebert’s office did not respond to a Newsline request for comment.

Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, in an opinion letter dated Thursday, recommended Hoskins reject the petition because the law describing the form says the petition must refer to “laws” passed by the General Assembly.
In the opinion letter, which has not yet been published on the attorney general’s website, Hanaway wrote: “A bill passed by the Missouri House of Representatives and Senate does not become ‘a law’ until it is either ‘approved by the governor’ or until the bill is not ‘returned by the governor within the time limits prescribed by this section.’” 
The redistricting plan, she wrote, “has not been signed by Governor Kehoe.”
In a statement to The Independent, Hanaway’s office said proponents should have waited.
“State law only allows a referendum on measures that have been enacted into law,” the statement provided by spokeswoman Abigail Bergmann read. “The referendum petition was thus premature.”
The redistricting plan seeks to flip the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, to Republicans. President Donald Trump began pushing for Missouri to redistrict in late July.
Richard von Glahn, leading the committee People Not Politicians in its quest to put the plan on a ballot, immediately called shenanigans and his attorney, Chuck Hatfield, wrote a letter demanding a revision.
“It is a matter of public record that the governor has announced his assent to the bill and intends to sign it on Sunday of this week,” Hatfield wrote in a footnote to his legal analysis. “Delaying review of the referendum forms on that basis is simply silly. Nothing allows you to do so.”
To be successful, a referendum petition must have signatures equal to 5% of the vote for governor in six of the state’s eight congressional districts. The petitions must be submitted within 90 days of the adjournment of the legislative session that passed the new law.
Lawmakers concluded the special session on Sept. 12, giving von Glahn’s group until Dec. 11 to submit the signatures.
“People Not Politicians has continued to face obstinance from politicians who refuse to perform their administrative duties and adhere to legal deadlines around processing the legally submitted referendum petition,” a news release from the campaign stated. “The group continues to gather signatures to put the issue before Missouri voters.”
If the decision is not reversed, the issue will go to the courts, von Glahn said.
“We are confident the courts will side with Missourians constitutional right to a referendum, as they always have,” he said in the news release.
In his letter challenging Hanaway’s legal analysis, Hatfield wrote that her constitutional references are inaccurate and she missed important sections that control the referendum process.
“Your letter ignores (the referendum clause), which guarantees to the people the ‘power to approve or reject by referendum any act of the general assembly,’” Hatfield wrote. “That is exactly what Mr. von Glahn seeks to do and the constitution is extremely clear.” 
In 2022, the Missouri Supreme Court found two laws that impeded the referendum process were unconstitutional. In that decision, the court found that signatures gathered before the ballot language for the petition had been written were valid.
In that case, administrative delays by the attorney general and the secretary of state were found to be improper barriers when opponents of a law banning abortions attempted an initiative in 2019.
“This is the same stuff we went through on the abortion case,” Hatfield said, “and the courts of appeals told them you can’t do that.”
This story was updated at 6 p.m. Friday with a comment from the attorney general’s office.

(iStock photo/ Getty Images Plus)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Friday she has joined attorneys general from 22 states in urging the Trump administration to oppose environmental policy from the European Union. 
The letter points to two elements of the European Union’s corporate sustainability directive and says they impose “sweeping” requirements tied to diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social, and governance practices, also known as DEI and ESG, that would place “severe burdens” on American businesses. 
Led by Florida and West Virginia attorneys general, the letter says the reporting requirements would cost American companies financially, create disincentives for American companies that use or invest in fossil fuels, “and worse, it creates potential liability for companies who do not wish to partake in this climate radicalism.” 
Bird, in a news release about the letter said the EU directives would be “bad for Iowa” and for the country. 
“I’m thankful we can bring this very urgent concern to the Trump Administration and know they have our country’s best economic interests at heart,” Bird said in the release. “The EU’s radical green agenda attempts to gut our energy industry and all the industries that rely on them, including agriculture, trucking, and manufacturing.”
The European Union is set to implement the “Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive” and the “Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive” both of which require companies that do a certain amount of business in the EU or globally to file reports on their environmental and social impacts. 
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, according to the EU, requires companies to publish reports detailing the “social and environmental risks they face, and on how their activities impact people and  the environment.” 
“This helps investors, civil society organisations, consumers and other stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability performance of companies, as part of the European green deal,” the EU stated on its website explaining the directive. 
The letter from the Republican attorneys general says these reports would require an “inordinate amount of time and expense” to create and would put “conflicting pressure” on companies that have changed their environmental, social, and governance practices “in response to (President Donald Trump’s) electoral landslide.” 
The letter says these reports would also make companies susceptible to “green-washing lawsuits.” 
According to the EU the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive’s core elements are “identifying and addressing potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts” from business operations, subsidiaries and through the value chain. This directive also requires companies to adopt a climate mitigation strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2050 climate neutrality objective. 
The letter calls this directive “a demand that ESG and DEI be incorporated into companies.” The letter also objects to the “aggressive” enforcement mechanisms of the “unconstitutional and immoral requirements.”
The attorneys general end the letter asking Trump to sdirect U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to oppose the EU’s directives.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza at a commercial turkey facility in Sanpete County, leading health agencies to quarantine all commercial facilities in the area. 
The highly pathogenic form of bird flu is contagious and may cause high mortality in poultry and wild birds. 
“Commercial turkey facilities in the northern U.S. and here in Utah have been the most impacted by HPAI this fall. With migratory bird season just beginning, we may see a greater impact as the season progresses,” State Veterinarian Amanda Price said in a statement, urging poultry producers to maintain strong biosecurity measures. 
The reported case involved a single round of birds from a facility in Sanpete County. The birds on that site will be “depopulated to prevent further spread,” the department of agriculture said in a news release. 
The state agency is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the response to the outbreak and will conduct additional surveillance and testing in neighboring areas.

“The loss of this flock is a significant hardship for the producer and their community,” Utah Department of Agriculture and Food Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said in the release.
However, he said the case “is not expected to cause a notable impact on the availability of turkeys in Utah or across the country leading up to Thanksgiving.”
“Consumers should feel confident that turkey and poultry products remain safe and readily available,” Pehrson said.
While the virus is a serious disease for birds, it currently doesn’t present an immediate risk to public health, the department said. 
Domestic flocks can get the disease from direct contact with wild birds, contaminated equipment or people moving between flocks. Signs of highly pathogenic avian influenza include frequent death in flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption and lack of coordination in birds. 
“Owners of birds experiencing any of these signs should immediately contact the State Veterinarian’s Office at statevet@utah.gov,” the release advised. Resources to protect flocks can also be found on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website.

Martin Heinrich on Friday discussed the impact the loss of Affordable Care Act health insurance rebates would have on NM.,"U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich on Sept. 26, 2025 in Las Cruces discussed the impact the loss of Affordable Care Act health insurance rebates would have on NM. (Leah Romero for Source NM)As a possible federal government shutdown looms, so does the chance that thousands of New Mexicans will see significant increases to their health insurance premiums.
The health insurance credits have become a sticking point in negotiations over a spending bill Congress needs to pass to avoid a government shut-down at the end of the month.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) spoke in Las Cruces Friday alongside representatives of BeWell, the state’s health insurance marketplace; La Clinica de Familia, a private, federally qualified health center; and New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, a social justice advocacy organization.
Heinrich explained that if passed, the GOP-led government funding bill will mean the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits will expire at the end of the plan year, and people insured under the ACA will see their monthly insurance premiums increase between $300 and $500.
Democratic governors rally Congressional Republicans to extend health care tax credits

“I don’t know about you, but after the last few years of increased costs, when you think about how inflation and tariffs have impacted everything from beef to coffee to what you buy at the hardware store, I don’t know New Mexicans who can afford another $300 or $400 a month in their health care premiums,” Heinrich said during the news conference. “This is going to be absolutely dire for the state of New Mexico… In addition, the president has basically directed his leadership in the Congress not to negotiate.” 
Victoria Hernandez, outreach and eligibility specialist for BeWell, explained that BeWell currently provides assistance to more than 75,000 New Mexicans to pay monthly premiums — about double the enrollment from several years before. With premiums increasing, “We’re going to have our families, our individuals, our fellow New Mexicans making some tough decisions,” she said. “Do I pay for health care, do I pay for rent, do I pay utility bills and my car payment?
NM Center on Law and Poverty Policy Director Arika Sánchez explained that the state has made significant progress in reducing the number of uninsured residents over the last decade – from 22% in 2013 to 12% in 2023.
“With nearly 810,000 New Mexicans currently accessing Medicaid and enrollment of about 75,000 on BeWell, the impact of coverage losses will be devastating, especially for our rural communities, low-wage workers, caregivers, hospitals and clinics,” Sanchez said. “And we know that when people don’t have health insurance, they’re forced to skip checkups and testing and the care they need. They wait until things get really bad before going to the doctor, and they often end up in the emergency room where services are the most expensive.”
She added that six to eight hospitals will be at risk for closing their doors within the next two years, if assistance is discontinued.
John Andazola, chief medical officer for La Clinica de Familia, said while his clinic will continue seeing patients regardless of their ability to pay, the loss of assistance will mean patients may not be able to pay for tests, X-rays, vaccines and other preventative care. It also could mean that the clinic will have to reduce its staff, cut services or close completely.
“Health care costs will rise due to delayed care, but also access to basic services will diminish if we are forced to reduce programs or worse, cut care and again, close our doors,” he said. “These cuts will not only threaten the physical health of our patients, it’ll threaten our patients’ financial stability.”
The New Mexico Legislature is slated to convene for a special session beginning next week, where health care coverage is included in the agenda. Fernandez said BeWell will be asking for  additional funds to support people in paying their increased premiums. 
“Our concern is that the state can’t sustain this forever,” she said. 
Heinrich added that while he appreciates the state’s willingness to step up and fill the need left by the federal government, it doesn’t have the financial capability to take on the large scale of need by New Mexicans.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heinrich-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118
,DC,2025-09-26 22:11:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Supreme Court allows Trump to cancel $4B in foreign aid already approved by Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-allows-trump-cancel-4b-foreign-aid-already-approved-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday reaffirmed its ruling from earlier this month that the Trump administration can withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, though the order notes the decision “should not be read as a final determination on the merits” of the case.White House budget director Russ Vought wrote on social media shortly after the order from the emergency docket was released that it represented a “Major victory.”The new nine-page order doesn’t provide any additional details about why a majority of the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to rescind the funding without congressional approval. But it does include a dissent written by Justice Elena Kagan that was supported by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighting the stakes in the case. “This emergency application raises novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress,” Kagan wrote. “It arises from the refusal of the President and his officers to obligate and spend billions of dollars that Congress appropriated for foreign aid.”The case, she wrote, brings up an issue the Supreme Court has never addressed.“Deciding the question presented thus requires the Court to work in uncharted territory,” Kagan wrote. “And, to repeat, the stakes are high: At issue is the allocation of power between the Executive and Congress over the expenditure of public monies.”Kagan noted that since the case came to the justices on the emergency docket, they had less than three weeks to consider it. “In a few weeks’ time—when we turn to our regular docket—we will decide cases of far less import with far more process and reflection,” Kagan wrote.She goes on to disagree with the majority of the justices, saying the Supreme Court “should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves.”Trump administration actions found illegal by watchdogThe ruling the Supreme Court posted Friday is similar to the one it released in mid-September when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. overturned a district court ruling that would have required the Trump administration to spend the money. The case now largely revolves around whether the White House budget office has the authority to send Congress a rescissions request during the last 45 days of the fiscal year, a maneuver the Government Accountability Office has called illegal. When the White House asks Congress to cancel previously approved spending through a rescission, lawmakers are supposed to have 45 days to approve, modify, or ignore the request. But Vought believes that any rescissions request sent up during those 45 days allows the White House to unilaterally cancel the funding, regardless of whether lawmakers agree or not. The Trump administration asked lawmakers to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs this summer through a rescissions request.Lawmakers mostly approved that proposal after preserving full funding for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.The White House budget office then sent lawmakers a second rescissions request in late August, proposing they claw back billions of additional foreign aid dollars. Neither the House nor the Senate has yet to vote on that proposal. But the Supreme Court’s ruling allows the White House budget office to withhold the funding anyway. Democratic members of Congress reactHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., issued a joint statement after the court’s ruling calling on their GOP colleagues to protect the institution’s power over spending decisions. “Congress can—and absolutely should—promptly reject President Trump and Russ Vought’s illegal effort to do an end run around the people’s elected representatives by passing a bill like the one we introduced last week,” they wrote. “Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse, rather than allow a president and an unelected bureaucrat who do not respect Congress or the Constitution to continue attacking our power to fight for the people back home that we represent.”",,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Jeanette Mullinax/Released)The U.S. Department of Defense has quietly extended the timeline to clean up “forever chemicals” at more than 100 military sites around the country, including Montana’s largest military outpost. 
Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls is among 140 military sites with a delayed investigations and remediation timeline for chemicals known as PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — which can take thousands of years to break down and can be present in water, soil and even food. 
The chemicals are found in waterproofing material, food packaging and in fire-fighting foam. The last source, used in emergency response training at airports and military bases, makes the Department of Defense one of the most prolific users of the chemicals. 
Studies have linked exposure to the chemicals with increased risks of cancer, immune disorders, problems with child development, and other adverse health effects, according to an EPA health advisory.
A Government Accountability Office figure showing the cleanup status of current and former DOD military installations, as of June 30, 2024.
The Defense Department has identified more than 700 military installations where PFAS was used or may have been released. Since 2017, the Department has spent $2.6 billion investigating and cleaning up the substances, according to a recent report to Congress. 
A spokesperson for Malmstrom could not immediately address Friday the extent of the cleanup that’s needed at the base. He estimated the population at the base to be from 4,000 to 5,000 people based on residential units and dorms.
The delays to cleanup timelines were first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday. The Times cross-checked a list of contaminated sites, only publicly released by the Pentagon in recent weeks, with a timetable released in December 2024, in the final days of the Biden administration. Roughly 140 sites have listed dates to complete preparatory work and begin cleanup pushed back several years. 
The Daily Montanan’s analysis of a progress report from Sept. 30, 2024, found that Malmstrom was slated to have its remedial investigation and feasibility study completed by September 2026. That date has now shifted to June 2032, according to the departments’s new progress report.
Estimated dates for two U.S. Army locations — Helena’s Fort William Henry Harrison and Helena Aviation Readiness Center — to investigate and complete feasibility studies for cleanup have not changed, with investigation and feasibility studies estimated to end in March of 2026 and September of 2028 respectively.
Nolan Lister, a spokesperson for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, said work on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process at Malmstrom is currently in the remedial investigation phase, and confirmed that the process has been extended for five more years, a decision that is “supported by DEQ.”
Lister said that the  report is expected to be submitted to DEQ in Spring  2026, and that data will then be incorporated into a feasibility study to determine the best actions for remediation. 
While no clean-up has yet been completed at the base, Lister said “best management practices” have been implemented to reduce PFAS in stormwater discharges and a “sundown” of aqueous film-forming foam in fire suppression systems. Fire and emergency vehicles are also in the process of switching to a fluorine-free foam, Lister added. 
“The Air Force has contracts in place to properly dispose of all (aqueous film-forming foam) collected from hangars and vehicles by end of 2025,” Lister wrote in an email. “In addition, at known (foam) release sites, any construction projects are required to coordinate with remedial project managers, and PFAS-contaminated soil is managed to minimize runoff. Any PFAS-impacted groundwater from dewatering is required to be treated or disposed appropriately as well.”
The New York Times reported that while the delays in site-specific cleanup operations were announced quietly, it comes amid debates about the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which in its current form would undo a ban on purchasing and using firefighting foam made with PFAS and shrink funding for toxic site cleanups. 
However, the NDAA also contains provisions to “accelerate remediation” of PFAS-contaminated sites, and provides for the department to create a publicly available online dashboard to track response efforts at each military installation. 
According to a 2025 Government Accountability Office report to congress on PFAS cleanup, the Department of Defense, referred to by the Trump administration as the “Department of War,” says that costs for investigation and cleanup have skyrocketed. 
“The department’s estimated future PFAS investigation costs more than tripled since 2022, while estimates for future pFAS cleanup costs have increased 15-fold,” the report states.
Lister, with Montana DEQ, said the department is “not aware of any funding delays regarding our PFAS investigations at Malmstrom or the Great Falls National Guard site,” but that if funds were shifted away from remediation efforts it could “slow progress along the CECRLA path, resulting in additional time passing before implementation of cleanup.”
“The Department of War has not communicated any potential funding delay,” Lister said. 
A Department of Defense PFAS progress update from March, 2025.
At the Montana Air National Guard Base in Great Falls, also listed on the DOD list of contaminated sites, remedial investigation work was expected to begin in September. Lister said that the remedial investigation is planned and “will be sequenced for funding alongside other ANG and Air Force enterprise-wide locations.”
The state’s cleanup efforts are funded through the Defense and State Memorandum of Agreement program on a two-year funding cycle. 
“DEQ is currently working through the process of generating work plans known as Joint Execution Plans with our federal partners for work that will be conducted 2027 to 2032,” Lister added.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 released new drinking water standards for certain PFAS compounds. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says they are still reviewing the new information and will look to adopt the standards into rule during a two-year process. 
According to EPA’s new recently released standards, public water supplies have three years to meet the PFAS sampling requirements and then two additional years to implement a remedy if the water quality results exceed the new standards.
The Department of Environmental Quality has sampled public water systems in Montana for PFAS contamination in recent years. Only one location, in Kalispell, was found to exceed EPA advisory levels.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/30564504860_7b53442c15_k-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)There are many closed doors at the state Capitol in Olympia. 
Sometimes it’s understandable. Confidentiality can be necessary in politics and policymaking. There are also meetings and conversations among public officials where it is not. Where the doors should remain open.
Meetings we’ve pressed for information about and access to in recent days provide examples of this latter category. 
One was on nuclear energy. The other Gov. Bob Ferguson called with fellow statewide elected officials. 
Both are reminders of the reflexive lack of transparency and inclination to tightly control the flow of information, that are now deeply ingrained in today’s politics and reflected frequently in Ferguson’s administration.
Exhibit 1
On Thursday and Friday this week, the National Governors Association convened a two-day Nuclear Energy Policy Retreat in the Washington state Capitol building. The association’s description of the program indicated the meetings would conclude “with a state strategic plan to pursue their Governor designated objectives” around nuclear policy.
There were panels on nuclear waste and the economics of nuclear power, among other topics. Representatives from the nuclear industry, utilities, companies like Amazon and Microsoft (which both have an interest in nuclear power for their data centers), and state agencies were all set to attend, according to the agenda.
A Friday session was moderated by Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, who is a Ferguson appointee, and featured state legislators and others.
State officials discussing the future of nuclear energy at the state Capitol. It seems like a matter of public interest. We inquired with Commerce and the governor’s office to see if the event would be open to press. And so began the runaround.
A Commerce spokesperson told us it was not and that she had no information about who at the state level helped organize the event where the agency’s leader was speaking. 
The spokesperson referred us to the governor’s office — not unexpected given Ferguson’s efforts to ensure responses from agencies to the press are routed through his staff.
The governor’s office deferred questions about press access to the National Governors Association, offered no assistance with gaining access, and ignored queries about who’d organized the event. Though they said the governor would not attend.
The National Governors Association, which gets money from taxpayer-funded dues that states pay, then denied us access. The group’s press secretary described the event — featuring an agency director, lawmakers, and more than 100 attendees, including some from the nation’s most powerful companies — as “a small group of state staff and specialists.”
Exhibit 2
When Ferguson’s office sent out its last schedule update for the governor, on Sept. 17, it showed a meeting this past Monday between him and the other eight statewide elected officials. We asked for information last week about what would be discussed and who would attend.
The governor’s office didn’t provide any, even though an agenda had been sent to those invited. After further follow-up, we got a short statement late Wednesday from the governor’s office summarizing the meeting.
It largely mirrored social media posts Ferguson made the next morning, complete with a glossy-looking photo of him speaking. He said the group discussed litigation, a new report “showing the devastation of Trump’s tariffs,” and protecting Washingtonians’ data from federal overreach.
“All of your statewide elected officials are working very hard to be extremely coordinated in dealing with what’s coming at us from Washington D.C.,” he wrote on X and Facebook.
Not mentioned in Ferguson’s recap are mounting state budget troubles that are not directly related to anything the federal government is doing.
We’d like to ask the governor about his views on the state’s fiscal health, like his positions on approving more tax increases in 2026, and some of the significant budget requests that have emerged this month from state agencies.
But he continues to shun interviews. So we’re stuck prying written statements from his communications staff — like the one he issued this week on the state’s weakening revenues, where he again focused on Trump.
As for the Monday meeting and Ferguson’s subsequent social media posts, it seems more like spectacle than governing, with the governor framing the sitdown in a way that underscores a core tenet of his political platform: He’s standing up to the president.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s 2026 Teacher of the Year said she’s excited to advocate for her profession and shine a light on challenges educators are facing.
“Sometimes we have the people who are the furthest away from the classroom making those classroom decisions with policy,” said Frannie Tunseth, a reading and math teacher from Mayville. “I think sometimes it’s on us educators to make sure we’re giving them better information as to what’s actually happening so they can make some better choices.”
Tunseth, who teaches at Mayville-Portland-Clifford-Galesburg Public School, was recognized Friday during a ceremony at the North Dakota Capitol. She was selected for the annual award out of 48 county Teacher of the Year candidates, which were narrowed down to four finalists.
“It feels so surreal to be honest,” Tunseth said after the ceremony. “Being up with all of these amazing educators is so inspiring. I’m almost awestruck.”

Tunseth works as a math and reading interventionist for grades 4-8, helping students struggling to keep up with their peers in those areas.
She said she hopes to promote more sustained professional development for teachers and wants to ensure that teachers have the ability to control their own classrooms without being constrained.
During the ceremony, North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler said Tunseth’s love for teaching was evident in her award application. She added the application included numerous letters of support and examples of how she supports students who struggle with learning. 
“Teachers have the opportunity to change the world by lifting up the next generation, and Mrs. Tunseth understands this as well as anyone,” Baesler said. “Mrs. Tunseth’s teaching is truly inspirational.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong called teaching “the most noble profession we have in North Dakota.”
“Nobody affects the future of North Dakota more than our teachers,” said Armstrong, who presented Tunseth with a personalized North Dakota license plate that reads “NDTOY26.” 
He added teachers like Tunseth are inspiring the next generation of law enforcement, doctors, accountants and other professions each community in the state relies on.
Tunseth previously taught in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, Grand Forks and Hillsboro and served as principal for three years at Griggs County Central School in Cooperstown.
She holds both bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of North Dakota and is expected to receive a doctorate in teaching in 2027, according to a Department of Public Instruction news release.

The companies suspended the program over remarks the comedian made in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing. 
The move means “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return to local TV on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates, including WTNH in Connecticut, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show. 
[RELATED: Protesters target WTNH over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension]
Disney-owned ABC suspended Kimmel on Sept. 17, following threats of potential repercussions from the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission. Sinclair also condemned the host — confirming that it would stop airing the show the same day.
The Maryland-based broadcast giant, which is known for conservative political content, called on Kimmel at the time to apologize to Kirk’s family — and taking it a step further, asked him to “make a meaningful personal donation” to Turning Point USA, the nonprofit that Kirk founded.
On the day Kirk was killed, Kimmel shared a message of support for Kirk’s family and other victims of gun violence on social media, which he reiterated during his Tuesday return to ABC. He had also called the conservative activist’s assassination a “senseless murder” prior to being taken off air.
Kimmel’s original comments didn’t otherwise focus on Kirk. He instead lambasted President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the killing. The comedian did not apologize on Tuesday, but did say “it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man” and acknowledged that to some, his comments “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”
He also used a blend of humor and pointed messages to emphasize the importance of free speech.
Even after Disney brought Kimmel back to its national airways, both Sinclair and Nexstar continued to preempt the show.
New episodes of the show air Monday through Thursday. Friday night’s rerun will be of Tuesday’s show — so viewers of Sinclair stations can see Kimmel’s emotional return to the air.
In its statement Friday, Sinclair pointed to its “responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming.”
The company, which operates 38 ABC-affiliated stations, added that it had received “thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,” and noticed “troubling acts of violence,” referencing the shooting into the lobby of a Sacramento station.
“These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important,” Sinclair added.
As a result of Sinclair and Nexstar’s boycott, viewers in cities representing roughly a quarter of ABC’s local TV affiliates had been left without the late-night program on local TV. The blackouts escalated nationwide uproar around First Amendment protections — particularly as the Trump administration and other conservatives police speech after Kirk’s killing. They also cast a spotlight on political influence in the media landscape, with critics lambasting companies that they accuse of censoring content.
Ahead of his suspension, Kimmel took aim at the president and his “MAGA gang” of supporters for their response to Kirk’s killing, which Kimmel said included “finger-pointing” and attempts to characterize the alleged shooter as “anything other than one of them.”
These remarks angered many supporters of Kirk — as well as FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who accused Kimmel of appearing to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about the man accused of the killing. Ahead of Kimmel’s suspension, Carr warned that Disney and ABC’s local affiliates could face repercussions if the comedian was not punished.
He later applauded Sinclair, as well as Nexstar, for their decisions to preempt the show.
On Sept. 17, Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith called Kimmel’s comments “inappropriate and deeply insensitive” and said that ABC’s suspension wasn’t enough. Smith added that Sinclair appreciated Carr’s comments — and called for “immediate regulatory action” from the FCC “to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”
Still, in Friday’s announcement, Sinclair maintained that its decision to preempt Kimmel’s show was “independent of any government interaction or influence,” Sinclair’s statement Friday read, adding that broadcasters had the right to exercise their own judgment.
While local TV affiliates broadcast their own programming, such as local news, they also contract with larger national broadcasters — and pay them to air their national content, splitting advertising revenue and fees from cable companies.
Sinclair said “constructive” discussions with ABC were ongoing, and said its proposals to the network to strengthen accountability, feedback and dialogue and appoint an ombudsman had not yet been adopted.
Representatives for ABC declined to comment on Friday.
Matthew Dolgin, senior equity analyst at research firm Morningstar, said he wasn’t surprised by Sinclair’s decision.
“The relationship with Disney is far too important for these firms to risk,” Dolgin said. And setting aside legal rights from either side, he added, “Disney would’ve been free to take its affiliate agreements elsewhere in 2026 if these relationships were too difficult. That scenario would be devastating to Nexstar and Sinclair.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267236103074-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

And any agreement, they said, is likely weeks away.
Lawyers for a Calhoun County voter appeared before Judge Daniel Coble in a downtown Columbia courthouse Friday, asking the judge to temporarily block the South Carolina Election Commission from sharing the personal data of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters.

The U.S. Department of Justice last month asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
South Carolina voter Anne Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
“I’ll tell you what people are worried about,” Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing Crook, told the judge.
“They’re worried the DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to give it to DOGE. They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to create a national database,” said the Orangeburg Democrat. “They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and give it to Homeland Security.”
Lawyers for the Election Commission argued there was no need for a temporary injunction blocking the information’s release because state law bars the agency from sharing it without an agreement in place.
Lawyers for Gov. Henry McMaster went further, asking the judge to throw the suit out altogether.
SC elections agency faces ongoing legal challenges over voter rolls amid directors’ firings

South Carolina already swaps voter information with other states, though that does not include driver’s license numbers, said Elizabeth Crum, an attorney for the Election Commission.
In all, the state shares its information with 32 states and Washington, D.C., election agency spokesman John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette.
Most of that goes through a partnership organization known as Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). The ERIC partners include both Democratic and Republican leaning states.
South Carolina also has freestanding agreements with Virginia, Ohio, and most recently, a nine-state agreement led by Texas.
And it has previously shared information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Crum said in response to a question from the judge.

That information was used by DHS as part of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, which is related to immigration. The Election Commission did not immediately provide details about when and what data was shared as part of that program.
Crum pointed to those agreements as examples of how the state plans to approach any agreement with the federal Justice Department.
“They say what the purpose is that they’re used for. It also says who has access to them. It says how they’re transmitted,” she said. “And there are several other security requirements in each of them.”
“There is no reason to believe and every reason to be assured that the Election Commission is not going to share anyone’s data unless and until they have a (memorandum of understanding) that protects the security of confidential information,” Crum added.

Acting agency director Jennifer Wooten testified the Election Commission expects the Justice Department to send a draft of the agreement in the next few weeks. The two agencies will then negotiate further on what the final document includes.
Crum also told the judge the Election Commission will hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed agreement before voting on whether to approve it.
In arguing that the case should be thrown out altogether, Grayson Lambert, the governor’s lawyer, said it’s the constitutional right of the federal government to regulate federal elections.
Because the state does not maintain separate state and federal voter rolls, he said, the federal government has a legitimate reason for wanting access to the information.
Hutto commended the Election Commission for making its assurances.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

“We all want safe elections,” he said. “We all want fair elections. We don’t want any fraud in elections.
If DOJ has the purest intention of using this information only for the security of the voter database, I don’t know that anybody objects to that,” he continued. “They have failed to say that. They will not answer that question.”
For that reason, Hutto said his client asked the judge to “maintain the status quo until such time as these assurances are in place, so that she can have the comfort and everybody in South Carolina can have comfort that their personal identifying information is protected from misuse and abuse.”
Judge Coble said he will rule on the matter at a later date.

(Photo via Google Earth)A second group of Keokuk residents have filed a potential class-action lawsuit against a corn-processing plant in the city, claiming noxious odors from the plant have created a public nuisance.
The lawsuit, filed this week in federal court, is the second of its type to be filed against Roquette America, a corn syrup and corn starch producer.
In June, two individuals who own property within 1,000 feet the plant, David M. Dye and Steve L. Andrews, sued the company and claimed they’ve been damaged by a “significant” increase in odors emanating from the site. That lawsuit is still pending.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The new lawsuit, based on similar claims, has been filed on behalf of two other Keokuk residents, Anne-Marie Helenthal and Debra Hunter.
The two lawsuits allege the plant features a wastewater treatment system to treat corn-processing byproducts and industrial waste, and that the company has failed to install, maintain and operate adequate odor mitigating strategies.
“The foul odors emitted from the defendant’s facility are offensive, would be offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary health and sensibilities, and have caused property damage,” the newly filed lawsuit claims.
The lawsuits have yet to be granted class-action status, but the most recent filing quotes putative class members Lana and John Jefferson as saying the smell “sometimes gets so thick in the air you almost puke,” and that despite building a new porch to sit outside they sometimes “just go back in ’cause of the smell and noise,” leaving them feeling trapped in their own home.
Court records indicate the plant was built about 122 years ago. However, the wastewater treatment facility on the site wasn’t constructed until 1977. In 1991, Roquette purchased the plant, and in 2013, Roquette allegedly began expanding its wastewater treatment system. According to court records, Roquette created an “overflow tank” in 2023 that resulted in a near-constant “foul and offensive odor” once it became operational.
The lawsuits allege the plant’s wastewater treatment is subject to separation-distance requirements that legally restrict its operations if there are habitable structures within 1,000 feet of the plant, unless a waiver has been signed by the nearby landowners.
Dye and Andrews claim they don’t recall signing any such waiver. “The odor far exceeds any typical normal operating procedural smells,” their lawsuit claims, adding that the smell is so severe that Dye and Andrews have had to leave their homes and stay in hotels, avoid using air conditioning or heating in order to prevent outside air from entering their homes, and avoid outdoor activities at home.
The odor, they allege, “contains harmful gases” that endanger their physical and mental health.
Federal records show that in October 2024, Roquette agreed to pay $207,488 in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Keokuk plant. The company also agreed to donate emergency response vehicles to the Keokuk Fire Department as part of the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the EPA, the company stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, on site and failed to comply with regulations intended to protect the surrounding community from accidental releases.
In addition, the lawsuits claim, Roquette previously entered into a consent decree with the EPA over alleged violations at the plant.
The lawsuits allege negligence in the construction and use of the plant; the creation of a nuisance that has deposited silt upon homes and vehicles and destroyed vegetation; and trespassing in the form of air contaminants that have “physically invaded” the plaintiffs’ property.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as an injunction permanently barring Roquette from diverting odor onto the plaintiffs’ property or interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their property.
An attorney for Roquette America has declined to comment on the litigation, but in response to the lawsuit filed in June, the company denied any wrongdoing and asserted that it “operates as a reasonable corn milling plant” that is “currently in compliance with all applicable permits.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — Kansas hospital leaders sent a letter to the state’s congressional delegation urging members to extend premium tax credits for those who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.
Republicans in Congress, including the state’s two senators and three of the four House members, stripped the tax credits from low-income families as part of a tax and spending bill earlier this year. As the federal government approaches a possible shutdown next week, Democrats are refusing to support a short-term spending plan unless Republicans make the tax credits permanent.
Health care providers say the loss of tax credits will especially hurt families and hospitals in rural parts of the state.
“The reality is that for a rural hospital like ours, every dollar counts,” said Preston Sayers, CEO of Kingman Healthcare Center. “A failure to extend the tax credits will cause Kansans to lose their coverage, and they often won’t qualify for Medicaid. This will lead to a surge in uncompensated care and make it even more difficult to keep our doors open and provide the care our communities depend on.”
More than 160,000 Kansans benefit from the tax credits that are expected to expire. They can expect to see a 77% increase in premiums.
That means a hike of $2,500 per year for a family earning $64,000 per year, or $18,000 for a 60-year-old couple making $82,800 per year, according to a news release from Ascension Via Christi, which operates hospitals in Wichita.
“As health care providers on the front lines of patient care, we know firsthand the devastating impact that a loss of affordable coverage would have on our communities,” said Kevin Strecker, CEO of Ascension Via Christi. “This is a direct threat to the financial well-being of Kansas families and the stability of our health care system, particularly our rural hospitals, which serve as a lifeline for their communities.”
In the letter sent Thursday to all six members of the state’s congressional delegation, the hospital leaders said as Kansans lose coverage, hospitals will face rising costs from uncompensated care. The letter was sent to Republican Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, and Republican Reps. Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Tracey Mann.
It was signed by leaders of Ascension Via Christi, Caldwell Regional Medical Center, Children’s Mercy Kansas City, Greenwood County Hospital, Hillsboro Community Hospital, Kingman Healthcare Center, NMC Health in Newton, Patterson Health Center in Anthony, Salina Regional Health Center and Wesley Healthcare.
“Allowing the premium tax cuts to expire will directly affect our ability as a rural health care provider to care for the community where we live, work and serve,” said Vallerie Gleason, President and CEO of NMC Health. “I urge our Kansas congressional delegation, who care deeply about rural Kansas and rural hospitals, to support extensions of the premium tax cuts.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Ron DeSantis holds a 287(g) check alongside Attorney General James Uthmeier, FHP director Dave Kerner and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan on Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has begun to reimburse Florida law enforcement for acting as federal immigration enforcement by arresting and detaining undocumented immigrants.
And though they presented Gov. Ron DeSantis Friday with hefty checks signed by President Donald Trump totaling more than $38.4 million for transportation and equipment costs, the federal government has yet to cover the at-minimum $245 million price tag for the Everglades detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The clock is ticking. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it will award the grant Florida requested weeks ago by Tuesday, Sept. 30 — now just five days away.
But DeSantis isn’t worried.
“What I said from the beginning on this is we will get reimbursed eventually,” he said at a press conference Friday afternoon, standing alongside ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. 
“I saw [White House Border Czar] Tom Homan the other day and he’s just like, ‘Send us your reimbursements. We got a lot of money now, we want to help you guys.’ So that’ll happen,” the governor continued.
He added that the only people detained at the site are “military-aged males,” and that the “cadence” of deportation flights out of the “Deportation Depot” center in Baker County is going so well, the state will be up to five flights per week starting next week. 
The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) applied to be federally reimbursed for the Everglades site sometime in mid-September. The timing is iffy, although the Florida Phoenix confirmed it happened shortly after a federal appeals court ruled that a federal environmental law did not apply to the facility — keeping it open — because it hadn’t received federal dollars.
Less than eight days later, FDEM asked for federal reimbursement. The money, if approved, would come from FEMA’s new Detention Support Grant Program, which has roughly $608.4 million in its coffers. 
ICE’s $1.7B state partnership push
On Friday, DeSantis spoke from the Florida Sheriffs Association building alongside law enforcement, ICE officials, and Uthmeier, who brainstormed Everglades site in mid-June alongside the Department of Homeland Security.
ICE announced that $1.7 billion will go to various states with ICE partnerships, called 287(g) agreements. This money will fund the costs of equipment needed to transport undocumented migrants. Florida accounts for $38.4 million of that total, or roughly 2.26%.
$28.4 million will go to state law enforcement and $10 million to local law enforcement. The overall breakdown is $2.7 million in transportation funding for local agencies, $7.3 million in equipment funding for 974 local officers, $1 million in transportation funding for state agencies, and $27.5 million for 3,676 state officers.
These are all officers or agencies that have entered into a 287(g) agreement, which deputizes state and local law enforcement as federal immigration actors and empowers them to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.
Florida mandated all counties and all county sheriffs to sign 287(g) agreements through a controversial new law in February. Lawsuits immediately began to crop up, one of which included a federal judge blocking officers from making these arrests. Uthmeier, who instructed law enforcement to do so anyways, was held in civil contempt (though it was later overturned).
That case has ping-ponged to a federal appellate court, to the Florida Supreme Court, and is now back in the appellate court pending oral arguments in October. Other cases included the city of South Miami questioning whether cities must enter into 287(g) agreements, Democrats arguing humanitarian violations at the Everglades site, and environmental groups trying to shut down that facility over concerns of harming the Everglades.
“Our state agencies are going to be reimbursed,” DeSantis assured Friday. “Some people tried to say that wasn’t gonna happen, and I think today with these checks, this is just the beginning.”

In a ruling earlier this week, the panel of three appellate judges said that Gabriel Metcalf’s conviction should be overturned because he offered a plausible interpretation and understanding of federal gun law, even while acknowledging that federal district court judge Susan Watters had a more straightforward and traditional definition of the law.
The majority opinion, written by Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, a former Montana Solicitor General, noted that Metcalf appears to be the only person to test whether Montana’s open carry gun law complied with the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. In his appeal, Metcalf also raised concerns that his conviction also violated his Second Amendment rights, but the appellate court stopped short of deciding that issue, ruling instead that Metcalf’s interpretation of the law was plausible, and therefore he could not have known he was violating federal law.
Judge Mary M. Schroeder issued a dissenting opinion in the case, saying that VanDyke and Judge John B. Owens had reached their conclusion “by means of a tortured application” of judicial principles, even while acknowledging that Watters had the better and more traditional interpretation of state and federal law.
VanDyke was appointed by President Donald J. Trump to the appellate court during Trump’s first term, and before that served as Assistant Solicitor General for Texas, Solicitor General of Montana and Solicitor General of Nevada. Owens was appointed by President Barack Obama.
However, VanDyke, writing the majority opinion, said that because Metcalf had provided a “plausible” reading of the law, and that there was no case law that could have possibly helped him understand the nuances of Montana’s gun laws and how they interact with federal law, the court was obligated to overturn the conviction.
“Our decision is a narrow one,” the ruling said. “Metcalf was the first, and to our knowledge, only person in Montana to have raised the license exception in response to a charge for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.”
  Scaring kids vs. verifying eligibility 

Metcalf lived across the street from Broadwater Elementary, which sits on the busy thoroughfare of Broadwater Avenue in the heart of Billings.
Residents and school leaders, as well as local law enforcement, had become alarmed when they saw Metcalf “patrolling” the neighborhood with guns, just across the street from the school’s playground.
Billings Police officers had been dispatched many times to talk with Metcalf, but concluded that state law offered no remedy. Still, school officials for a time abandoned part of the playground, moving students to the back side of the building and putting a black tarp up that blocked the view of the elementary students as a precaution.
Meanwhile, Metcalf claimed that a former neighbor, since convicted of felony, had been harassing he and his mother with whom he lived, and that he was simply patrolling his property, defending himself and protecting his mother whom he walked to work and back. Metcalf’s mother had a restraining order in place against this former neighbor, and court records confirm that the man had indeed been actively bothering Metcalf and his mother.
Metcalf had grown so weary of visits by local law enforcement that he called federal authorities to report that his Second Amendment Rights had been violated. However, officers with the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agency instead found that he was violating federal law by carrying a gun in a gun-free school zone.

But the appeals court in its review noted that Montana’s gun law was unique and ambiguous. While state law allows a person who has not been convicted of violent felony to carry a gun in a gun-free school zone, the state law also says that the person must be “verified.” However, Montana doesn’t specify a verification process or a special licensing process; instead, the Legislature has granted broad gun rights to all citizens who haven’t been convicted of a violent felony.
“The Montana Legislature has made clear that it enacted its state license to comply with federal law, and it did so by directly licensing individuals by statute, rather than by delegating authority to separate state or local agencies,” the ruling said. “Because Congress did not make a clear statement prohibiting Montana’s decision to act, the legislature, rather than through delegated authority other than state officials, Metcalf’s proffered interpretation finds support.”
However, the appeals court also noted that Watters may have correctly determined that Montana’s gun carrying laws may not comport with the federal gun-free zone act. It also said that there was no way — no case law — that Metcalf could have relied upon to make that determination.
“Per the district court, ‘Montana Individual Licensure does not meet this requirement because it automatically considers every person in the state to be licensed then claws back licensure from those who have committed violent felonies or are disqualified by the Montana Constitution,’” the decision said.
But because of the law’s ambiguity, the appellate court found Metcalf could not have known what was lawful.
“Both the government and the district court seemed to equate the act of ‘verifying’ with conducting an individualized background (or qualifications) check,” the court’s opinion said. “A background check is certainly one way of verifying that an individual is qualified to hold a license. But, it is not the only way of doing it.”
While the district court judge found that Metcalf had not been verified to carry a gun in the area, Metcalf’s belief that he didn’t need to go through a formal process was “plausible.”
“Metcalf lacked the appropriate notice to be convicted of violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act. Affirming Metcalf’s conviction would be inconsistent with the principles of fair notice and of not punishing innocent conduct,” the appeals court ruled.
Schroeder, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, balked at the other two judge’s conclusions, saying they adopted the judge’s reasoning as a correct and the more credible interpretation, but twisted the law to favor Metcalf.
“The majority stretches these principles in Metcalf’s case because it apparently views him to be a sympathetic person who has been unjustly treated,” she said. The result leaves him free to pick up arms and continue to frighten the neighbors, that include the school across the street.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-7188-scaled-e1733786147380-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY —  Oklahoma’s mental health department hasn’t met the required benchmarks of a consent decree settling a 2023 lawsuit, according to a report published Friday. 
The agency has produced “incomplete and internally conflicting” data, submitted plans missing essential information, and has not demonstrated “true urgency” in dealing with the consent decree, the report found.
While the leadership of recently appointed Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic has led to a “new approach” to the consent decree, “hard work and good efforts do not necessarily equate to best efforts,” the report written by a team of court-appointed consultants found. 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has made improvements in its communication with consultants, workplace culture, leadership and on some of the benchmarks, according to the report. 
The landmark consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. 
It’s expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. Failure to comply could result in financial penalties. 
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said the agency continues to work closely with the court-appointed consultants and values their guidance. 
“We appreciate the consultant’s recognition of our progress,” she said in a statement Friday. “Change of this scale doesn’t happen overnight, but the court consultants’ advice has been crucial to our progress. (The Mental Health Department) is working to implement all recommendations and is committed to satisfying the best efforts requirement of the consent decree.”
The report revealed inconsistencies in data and a lack of a carefully considered plan to carry out the consent decree. For example, the consultants wrote they received conflicting reports of how many people are currently awaiting competency restoration services and the average time spent on a waitlist. 
The consultants said the agency failed to meet benchmarks across multiple categories, which could result in either financial or injunctive remedies. 
They offered guidance for the issues throughout the report and said financial penalties will only be incurred in this instance if other “recommendations and deliverables are not first satisfied.”
“While we offer no excuses for (the Mental Health Department), we also believe that the Department’s administrative forensic service continues to operate with a shoestring staff and limited funding,” the consultants writing the report wrote. “Important changes have occurred, but the Department needs more resources, including a senior official in charge of the Decree with exclusive responsibility for its implementation, as well as the infusion of additional funding for staff salaries, new hires, and additional resources.” 
Slavonic’s leadership has created a new “tone” within the agency that allows for staff to work more freely with the consultants and steps have been taken to change critical leadership, the report found. But the Mental Health Department is still far behind in its efforts to comply with the consent decree, the report said. 
Allie Friesen, the former commissioner, was originally tasked with carrying out the terms of the consent decree and was named in the lawsuit. Friesen was fired by state lawmakers in May following weeks of uncertainty about the agency’s finances. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the report was “alarming” and it will take “tremendous effort” to get the agency on track with the consent decree’s required timeline. 
“The consent decree that my office helped broker will save the state untold millions of dollars, but it is critical that the Department of Mental Health actually comply with the plan,” he said in a statement.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state heath insurance plan is going to help members who use Duke doctors find alternative medical providers, as protracted negotiations over payments drag on. 
Duke Health and Aetna, the health plan’s third-party administrator, have been locked in negotiations for months. The contract between Aetna and Duke Health expires Oct. 20. State Health Plan trustees approved a resolution Friday that will have offer “white-glove service” to beneficiaries who use Duke in helping them find new doctors.
Aetna insures about 1.5 million North Carolina residents, including about 750,000 through the state employee health plan. If there’s no agreement by Oct. 20, Duke Health will no longer be part of Aetna’s provider network, and most patients who continue to see its doctors will pay higher costs. That means thousands of state employees and teachers would pay higher medical bills if they remain Duke patients. 
Adopting a contingency plan is unprecedented move, and state Treasurer Brad Briner said he is holding out hope for an agreement by the contract deadline. 
“If we end up out of network, Duke is the one who made that choice,” he said. “They will have made that choice that their financial goals are more important than their mission to serve.”
He criticized what he called Duke’s “aggressive tactics” – radio ads and letters to beneficiaries – which he said were meant to scare them and convince them to argue on the health system’s behalf. 
Briner said the public pressure campaign was beneath one of the state’s preeminent non-profit hospitals. 
In a prepared statement, Duke Health said it is continuing good-faith negotiations with Aetna to ensure patients covered under the insurer’s plans can continue uninterrupted access to Duke primary care doctors and specialists. 
“We have a responsibility to our patients to communicate about potential impacts to Duke Health care access,” said the statement attributed to Duke Health officials.  “They may need more time than the required notice period allows. We’ve sent communications to our patients to provide them with context on the negotiations, continuity of care and how they can provide feedback to both negotiating parties, Duke Health and Aetna.”
Despite rising costs, Duke Health has not received a rate adjustment from Aetna in four years, the statement said, adding that the increases it is requesting are below the rate of inflation. 
“We recognize and understand the pressures facing the State Health Plan,” the statement said. ”Less than 6% of State Health Plan members receive care at Duke Health and the modest increases we’re seeking from Aetna would have minimal to no effect on premiums.”
The 22,000 people on the state health plan and who have a Duke primary care doctor, and about 40,000 members who have filed a claim through Duke this year will be contacted about finding new medical providers. 
About 2,800 people on state health insurance who use Duke Health for treatments are protected under the continuity of care law. They will be able to continue to use Duke Health as an in-network provider after the contract expires, but need to fill out paperwork. These are mostly patients receiving maternity care or cancer treatments.
Duke Health came under blistering criticism from Dr. Brian Miller, a health plan trustee, who recited figures from Duke Health’s financial audits, and noted its $4.3 billion in investments. 
“This does not sound like a health system that is in financial distress,” he said. “Duke is choosing to prioritize its investment portfolio instead of the heath of local citizens who work as custodians, help take care of parks, local teachers. They would rather pad their investment portfolio off the backs of these workers. I find that a fundamental moral failure, and I am sincerely disappointed.”
Health Plan Executive Director Tom Friedman said after the trustees meeting that the plan asked every provider to either hold the line on costs or even take less next year as the plan moved to close its financial hole. It cannot now give one provider a lot more after asking others to sacrifice, he said. 
“How are we going to look them straight in the eye and say ‘Yes, this was fair,” Friedman said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4769-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Wyoming’s public records ombudsman is trying to get the word out about a task force that seeks to improve the law that gives citizens access to government work.
The post Little public notice of Monday’s critical public meeting regarding Public Records Act appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s public records ombudsman says there’s been little public notice of a public meeting regarding the Public Records Act scheduled for Monday, and she’s trying to get the word out.
An appointee in Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, Darlena Potter, agreed to chair a legislative committee’s working group on Monday to hash out changes to the law. The goal is to make improvements sought by the public, state and local agencies and governments — changes that could be adopted by the Legislature in early 2026.
But lacking the official status that would allow her working group the public-notice resources and reach of the Legislative Service Office, Potter is scrambling to let policy wonks, reporters and even the odd town-council gadfly a chance to weigh in.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used.” Darlena Potter
Public records requests have increased significantly in recent years, Potter said.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used,” she said. Citizens are “trying to get a grasp on the transparency issue of what sort of items their taxpayer dollars are going towards.”
She called the increase in public records requests “a huge shift, which is kind of encouraging.”
Citizens are trying to educate themselves, she said, but “they’ve run into a few hurdles.”
The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions that considered two draft bills at its Aug. 14 meeting also encountered bumps. Scheduled for an hour and 45 minutes of discussion, the public records deliberation lasted more than five hours before lawmakers assigned Potter the task of shaking things out through a working group.
The group will meet for the first time at 10 a.m. Monday in Room W-113 of the Wyoming Capitol. People can participate remotely through this Zoom link.
‘Any information…’
A public record is “any information in a physical form created, accepted, or obtained by a governmental entity in furtherance of its official function and transaction of public business,” according to the law. Wyoming Statute 16-4-201 through 205 requires that “all public records shall be open for inspection by any person,” with some obvious exceptions for privacy reasons. Records custodians can charge a reasonable fee for copies.
Three topics are foremost among Potter’s worries. One is the timeline for responding to and delivering public records sought through a request.
“Currently, the statute mandates a seven business-day acknowledgment of a public records request and production of documents within 30 calendar days,” Potter wrote in a memo. One proposal suggests a three-day acknowledgment and 10 calendar day production of documents, but that framework remains under debate.
Another issue is the cost of obtaining copies of public records. Because laws prevent some private information from being released, some requests require costly review by lawyers.
“There was some discussion of standardizing these,” Potter said of the August committee meeting discussion. “Some areas of the state are more expensive than others to produce the same types of documentation and, in the state statute, it just says ‘reasonable’ [fees].”
Finally, there’s the issue of data mining. Potter said she’s seeing lots of requests from out-of-state entities for a large volume of information.
Consider, for example, all the gear companies and outfitters who might want a list of addresses of the holders of Wyoming elk licenses. Imagine an entrepreneur’s 2025 pitch: “Want to buy a corner-crossing ladder?”People who want to learn more about the corporations committee’s struggles and draft legislation can access meeting materials and a recording of the August session on the LSO website.

In addition to sunsetting a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Sept. 25, 2025.
This week, Catamount Solar technicians are expected to power up Randolph’s Community Solar 2 project, a recently completed, net-metering array on Beanville Road that may be the last of its kind in Vermont, at least for a while.
The future of such arrays, wherein community members buy shares and reap a reduced electric bill for years to come, has taken a hit from the state. Vermont no longer allows new group net-metering projects.
“We had to really hustle because after December 31, just passed, there were going to be no more permits approved,” said Jerry Ward, a retired physician who serves as the lead community organizer on CS2. “So we, in December, got that permit filed. And as of now, there will be nothing like this again until the law changes again.”
Still, during a visit to the CS2 site last Friday, the mood was celebratory.
“It’s definitely an exciting moment,” said Kevin McCollister, co-founder of Catamount Solar, as he walked down to the array, checking to make sure Green Mountain Power had delivered a meter.
GMP had, “so now we’ll get our guys back here to commission it.”

McCollister explained the basics of what’s next: the array will be turned on and start making power, and the credits from the power will be shared among the project’s subscribers according to the number of shares that they purchased.
CS2, a member-owned LLC, has 22 subscribers from the greater Randolph area. Typically an array of this size — it consists of 324 solar panels — benefits about 25 average households, Ward explained, but a few of CS2’s members are “pretty big.”
Ward and McCollister noted two more entities who will benefit from the array. Thanks to two anonymous shareholders, one in Brookfield and one in Royalton, the food shelves in Randolph and South Royalton will receive renewable energy credits on their utility bills.
The cost of buying into CS2, for an average household — about 4% of the array — is about $25,000, said Ward.
“It’d be about like buying it (for) your roof, a little bit cheaper.”
Over the first year, shareholders can expect to save about $172 per kilowatt; a 5-kW share would amount to savings of about $860 a year.
CS2 takes up about three-quarters of an acre on a 1.5-acre patch of land owned by Matt and Sarah Murawski on Beanville Road. CS1, Randolph’s first community solar project, on South Randolph Road, was developed about 10 years ago.
Completion of CS2 comes at a time when the federal government is darkening the future of solar, with energy policies that push costs higher for consumers.
In addition to a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners going away at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies — with various effective dates — and ordered the Internal Revenue Service to revise a safe-harbor provision that would have protected some project timelines for clean energy developers.
“What we’re seeing on the federal level is atrocious,” said McCollister, who is set to retire later this year. “It’s terrible, for so many reasons and on so many levels. And for whatever reason, this administration really doesn’t like renewables, especially wind and solar, and they’re really trying to do everything they can to stop it.”
While expressing his dismay over federal actions, McCollister noted that solar is not going away, “especially in Vermont,” where “people understand that it’s important.
“We need to do something. People want to do something to address climate change. It’s something that’s very practical that individuals and homeowners can do to make a difference. And on top of it, our electricity rates are only going up,” he said, noting that, historically, GMP had about 3 to 3.5% rate increases annually.
This year, the rate increase is 7.4%.
“There’s a clear trend (that) rates are going up faster than we’re used to. The national policies are only going to increase that trend, I believe, which makes solar a really viable option. It’s going to remain being a good investment for people.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Air National Guard/Master Sgt. Megan Floyd)COLUMBIA — The state is under a state of emergency as a so far-unnamed tropical disturbance potentially heads toward the coast, Gov. Henry McMaster declared Friday.
A state of emergency frees up the resources and state employees to prepare for the possibility of landfall, along with allowing state and local authorities to apply for federal emergency reimbursements if needed, according to a news release.
It also triggered the state’s anti-price-gouging law.
Meteorologists are predicting a 90% chance the disturbance, designated Friday as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, will become a tropical storm over the weekend. If that happens, the disturbance will be named Imelda.
South Carolina residents, especially along the coast, should prepare for high winds, potentially causing power outages, along with heavy rainfall and storm surge early next week, according to the National Weather Service.
“While the storm’s arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,” McMaster said in a news release. “We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations.”
The disturbance’s path remains uncertain, according to a mid-day National Weather Service briefing. The system could strike the Carolinas early next week or linger just over the ocean near South Carolina, dumping rain on coastal cities, meteorologists wrote.
Or, the disturbance could approach the coast before veering back out to sea, like Hurricane Humberto, another approaching storm, is expected to do.
The proximity of the two storms is part of the reason for uncertainty.
Meteorologists are unsure whether the two might collide, forming another system, or send each other spinning off onto different courses, according to the briefing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/8574450-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(File photo NC Newsline)  Former North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse will oversee county boards of elections in a new role with the State Auditor’s Office, Auditor Dave Boliek announced in an email to county board chairs.
“To assist in your efforts to ensure election integrity while encouraging maximum participation in our elections, I have appointed Dallas Woodhouse as my liaison to the local and state board of elections,” Boliek wrote. “Mr. Woodhouse will serve as my eyes and ears on the ground in our elections process.”
Woodhouse’s responsibilities as election liaison, a new role in the auditor’s office, will include shaping early voting plans, election policy, and oversight, according to the email. He declined to comment, referring the request to a spokesperson for Boliek.
He served as executive director for the state GOP from 2015 to 2019, after which he held roles in the John Locke Foundation and the Civitas Institute, prominent right-leaning think tanks in the state. Woodhouse has served as North Carolina executive director of American Majority, a conservative training nonprofit, since 2023.
Randy Brechbiel, a spokesperson for the state auditor, wrote in a statement that “election liaison is his current and only role,” indicating he would not continue to work for the nonprofit. He wrote that Woodhouse will focus on efforts to “ensure election integrity” and support “maximum participation in elections.”
Gerry Cohen, a member of the Wake County Board of Elections, said he spoke with Woodhouse soon after the announcement and believes he is “serious about it” and “has the knowledge base to perform the role,” though added that “doesn’t mean I agree with everything.”
“I’ve known Dallas for like 15 years or so and had a good working relationship with him, and I think it’s good to have somebody who knows something about elections in the process,” he said.
In his role with the state GOP, Woodhouse pushed GOP county board members to limit early voting to deter same-day registration, eliminate Sunday voting and block early voting sites on college campuses.
“We believe same-day registration is ripe with voter fraud, or the opportunity to commit it,” Woodhouse wrote in a 2016 memo. “Same-day registration is only available during early voting. We are under no obligation to offer more opportunities for voter fraud.”
Ahead of the 2024 election, Woodhouse voiced greater openness for early voting, urging conservatives to “vote as soon as possible or be prepared to lose” in a column for The Carolina Journal. He said he planned to complete his own mail-in ballot at the earliest opportunity.
Cohen cautioned against reading into statements Woodhouse made as a party official.
“I just wouldn’t assume that positions that Dallas took 10 years ago when he was executive director of the state Republican Party, I would not assume that has anything to do with how he will handle this job working for the state government assisting in administration of elections,” he said.

Thanks to a federal judge’s order, the 27-year-old DACA recipient was released Wednesday from the Otero County Processing Center in New Mexico. (Courtesy ACLU-NM)A federal judge in New Mexico this week ordered the release of a 27-year-old man held in federal immigration detention in Chaparral for 42 days, a detention that occurred even though he had previously received a federal promise of deferred deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira at his home in Horizon City, Texas on Aug. 13, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. Agents then took Gamez Lira to the Otero County Processing Center in Southern New Mexico, where he was held until Wednesday.
Gamez Lira has lived in the United States since infancy, according to the ACLU, and he successfully secured Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status after President Barack Obama signed an executive order granting deportation protections in 2012. Gamez Lira, a father of four who works as a forklift driver, had valid DACA status when ICE agents detained him, according to the ACLU.

The civil rights group and private law-firm Singleton Schreiber, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence, sued Sept. 3 in federal court, alleging Gamez Lira’s constitutional rights were being violated. 
In response, acting United States Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison said the government did not oppose Gamez Lira’s release, according to a Wednesday court filing, though he wrote that the government’s lack of opposition to his release does mean it accepts factual or legal allegations his lawyers made in the lawsuit. 
Shortly after Ellison’s filing, federal judge William P. Johnson ordered Gamez Lira’s immediate release Wednesday. 
“This has been the most difficult time of our lives, but we never lost hope that justice would prevail,” said Alejandra Gamez Lira, the detainee’s wife, in a statement provided by the ACLU. 
ICE previously declined to comment about the lawsuit in a statement to Source New Mexico, citing the federal litigation. 
Gamez Lira’s lawyers celebrated his release and criticized ICE for arresting a DACA recipient. 
“This case shows that the government absolutely should refrain from detaining DACA recipients, and we are grateful that swift legal action here has resulted in Paulo being reunited with his loved ones,” said Becca Sheff, a lawyer with the ACLU-NM, in a statement.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp_image_2025-09-02_at_5.27.41_pm_5-e1758921002646.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Ron DeSantis (right), Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees (at the podium), then-Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, (left) and then-Deputy Secretary for Health Shamarial Roberson (far left). (Photo by Issac Morgan/Florida Phoenix)Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo has dismissed concerns that not enough research was done before he and Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last month that they intend to dismantle school vaccine mandates, saying this is an issue of “parents’ rights.”
But his predecessor — Dr. Scott Rivkees — says the matter has “nothing” to do with parental rights.
“This is part of an organized strategy to undermine vaccinations in Florida,” said Rivkees, who was Florida’s surgeon general from 2019-2021.
“This is a string of different policies and different statements that [Dr. Ladapo] has made to undermine vaccination. As far as this notion about personal freedom, I get that. But on the other hand, we can talk about personal freedom for one group of individuals who actually will impinge on the personal freedom of other individuals,” he continued.
“If we don’t have enough population protection, which means vaccinating children, individuals who may be immunocompromised, people who have been treated for cancer, people who are older, they’re actually going to have their rights and liberties trampled on by not being able to go out in public when outbreaks occur.”
Speaking on WMNF 88.5 FM radio to a Phoenix reporter on Friday, Rivkees, now a professor of medicine at Brown University, said the proposal offered by Ladapo and DeSantis to make Florida the first state in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements “is a predetermined ideology that is not based on science.”
“Vaccines have prevented hundreds of millions of deaths. For vaccinations to work, you need two things to happen: Parents need to vaccinate their children. But also, because some individuals vaccines are not 100% effective — you know, people are immunocompromised — people [who] have cancer are also dependent upon other people being vaccinated for their children so that we have population safety.”
mRNA vaccines
Speaking on a podcast called “On Call” with Houston physician Dr. Mary Talley Bowden earlier this month, Dr. Ladapo said he didn’t want mRNA Covid-19 vaccines available in the state. “The goal with the mRNA is for that not to be available to anyone, because no one should be using that one,” he said.
If Ladapo wants to rid the state of mRNA vaccines, he should provide other options, Rivkees said.
“Last year, Dr. Ladapo said no one should have mRNA vaccines but did not propose any alternatives for people. What are they going to do instead?” he asked, adding that the opposition to mRNA vaccines makes no sense.
“This is something that has been looked at extensively,” he said. “There’ve been just under a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines that have been given in the U.S. They’ve been incredibly effective. … The notion that they get into the human genome [and] affect our genes is absolutely not true. So, these are vaccines that are safe. They’re effective. During the pandemic they are estimated to have saved anywhere between two and three million lives.”
Ladapo already has the power to remove some vaccine requirements by simple rule changes. That means that starting in early December (taking effect 90 days after the Sept. 3 announcement) school vaccinations will no longer be required for hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type b (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate virus. That’s according to a statement sent by the Florida Department of Health that was reported by ABC News.
Others, however, including poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella are still in place and won’t be removed unless the Legislature opts to do so when it convenes for its 2026 session in January.
Rivkees was a practicing pediatric endocrinologist and working as a professor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine when the governor picked him to lead the Florida Department of Health and serve as surgeon general in April 2021. He had also served as associate chair of pediatrics for research at the Yale University School of Medicine and was on the faculty at Harvard Medical School.
In his first year as surgeon general, Rivkees declared a public health emergency and encouraged vaccinations in Florida after more than 2,000 cases of Hepatitis A were registered in the state. He then led the efforts to vaccinate more than 200,000 people against the virus.
DeSantis ‘pivot’ on vaccines
When COVID-19 emerged early in 2020, Rivkees led the effort once the mRNA vaccine was available to administer. Florida had one of highest vaccination rates against the novel coronavirus and lowest death rates per capita in the country because the governor “embraced Covid vaccines,” he said.
“There was a major pivot by Gov. DeSantis about halfway through the pandemic,” he now says.
“We went to a situation where all of a sudden he stopped supporting vaccines. Vaccination rates fell and then, when the Delta wave hit in the summer of 2021, Florida went from having among the best vaccination rates and lowest mortality rates to among the worst. We see the painful consequences of changes in these policies.
“Being a pediatrician, having seen severe cases of childhood meningitis, chicken pox, hepatitis B, it breaks my heart that again we can be relieving these horrible diseases that cause so much harm to children and are vaccine preventable. “
A survey of 631 registered Florida voters conducted by Bendixen & Amandi International taken Sept. 7-9 found that 60% opposed ending vaccine mandates and just 37% supporting it.

A new report ranks states on extreme weather and air quality risks.
(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine have the best combination of relatively low environmental risks and robust environmental policies, according to a report released this week.
West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi ranked lowest on the 50-state scorecard produced by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that advocates for health care improvements.
Researchers at Northeastern and Yale universities ranked states based on risks from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, natural hazard risks to health care facilities and greenhouse gas emissions by the health care sector. The authors of the report also analyzed states’ clean energy policies and climate change mitigation efforts.
Climate change poses a severe threat to public health, leading health organizations have warned. Poor air quality, for example, contributes to between 100,000 and 200,000 excess U.S. deaths per year. Communities of color, low-income people, outdoor workers, people  with disabilities and homeless people are  more vulnerable to health harms associated with climate change.

In Florida, for example, nearly 15% of hospital beds are in high-hazard flood zones, according to the report — the highest share of any state. Coastal states Louisiana and Mississippi, where around 10% of hospital beds are in flood zones, also fared poorly.
West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota had the highest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from the health care sector in 2020. That year, West Virginia’s health care sector emitted 2,570 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent —- a measure of greenhouse gases’ warming effects —- per capita.
The report comes two days after President Donald Trump rebuffed the scientific consensus on climate change in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. “This ‘climate change’ – it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said in his Tuesday speech. The assembly included leaders from highly vulnerable nations and islands around the world that are suffering drought, threats to water security and increased flooding that scientists tie to climate change.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

The Trump administration has fired numerous officials and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and has rescinded environmental justice grants awarded to states, nonprofits and universities. The administration also shut down the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
In July, the EPA announced a proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards. These are based on scientific findings over decades that tie greenhouse gas emissions to public health dangers and serve as the basis for regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called the proposal “negligence” that will “cause great harm to the American people.”
Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona faced the greatest extreme heat-driven health risks, according to the scorecard. These states have significant Indigenous and Latino populations. Previous reports have shown American Indian and Alaska Natives have seen the greatest per-year average increase of heat-related deaths, and outdoor workers are disproportionately Black and Latino.
Arizona and California had the poorest air quality, most likely driven by ground-level ozone, wildfire smoke and dust, the researchers said. They used the federal air quality index, which estimates levels of five main air pollutants, to score the states on air quality.
Alaska and Hawaii ranked highest in air quality. Alaska’s low population density contributed to its score, while Hawaii, situated in the Pacific Ocean, benefits from winds that disperse air pollutants, the authors wrote.

(Logos)The union representing workers at Rhode Island’s ABC affiliate is urging a boycott of the station and its NBC counterpart to pressure new operator Sinclair Inc. to keep the two channels separate after it recently acquired ABC6’s non-license operations.
Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which already owns NBC 10 (WJAR), took over the infrastructure and operations for ABC6 (WLNE) on Sept. 12, putting the Maryland-based media company known for its conservative political content in control of two of the three TV stations covering Rhode Island and parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. CBS affiliate WPRI-12 is owned by Nexstar Media Group.
WLNE’s acquisition by Sinclair came as 20 unionized station employees organized under the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians of the Communications Workers of America in March 2024 were negotiating their first contract with Standard Media Group.
The union is calling on Sinclair to invest more in the station, rather than make cuts as it has done in other markets. 
“Viewers deserve journalism that is supported and invested in, not stripped for parts,” the union said in a press release. 
The union also demands Sinclair offer those it has laid off the ability to return, such as fan-favorite meteorologist Kelly Bates. Bates, who previously worked for NBC10, said ABC6 staff were alerted about the local market share agreement between Sinclair and Standard Meida during a staff meeting Sept. 11.
“I asked if everyone was going to walk out of here with a job and they said no,” she said in an interview Friday with Rhode Island Current. “Then they ended the meeting and told me I needed to come upstairs.”
Bates said she was told her position was redundant, which she said was puzzling as the initial statement from Sinclair “committed to producing distinctive content.”
“If you’re maintaining two distinct voices as they claim, then how am I redundant?” she said.
Jessica Bellucci, a spokesperson for Sinclair, did not respond to request for comment Friday.
Bates also worries what market consolidation will mean for the quality of news Rhode Island TV viewers receive.
“When you drop a source of information, it makes you less informed,” she said. “When these large corporations are buying these small stations, they lose their sense of community.”
Also off the job at ABC6 following the acquisition is sports reporter Nick Coit, who announced his departure from the station on Facebook Sept. 12. Daytime meteorologist Tyler Hughes, who joined the station in June, confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday he is no longer at the station.
The Boston Globe has reported that WJAR eliminated nine jobs from its master control department, the final point before a station’s signal is transmitted over the air. 
To show support for workers across both stations, the union is asking viewers to call NBC 10 General Manager Vic Vetters and support workers and local programming. Public figures are being asked to decline interview requests from Channel 10 or Channel 6, and for advertisers to shun the stations. 
Vetters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sinclair owns and operates 182 television stations nationwide, including 25 NBC and 39 ABC affiliates. It entered the Providence-New Bedford market in 2014 when it bought WJAR after the station’s former owners, Media General, merged with another company.

Lindell has been accused of domestic violence; admitted to filing a “fake bankruptcy”; has made and lost fortunes; claimed to have spent 14 days awake on cocaine before his drug dealers staged an intervention; and once made a $5 million challenge to anyone who could disprove his claim that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump, only to have a computer programmer meet the challenge, leading to years of litigation.
Lindell’s current financial status is mostly opaque because his companies are private. He’s acknowledged financial struggles, both personal and corporate. He’s blamed the money issues on being “canceled” by mainstream media and retailers for his close ties to Trump.
The Strib reports that “Lindell is on the hook for $2.3 million, pending appeal, following a defamation verdict related to his election-fraud claims. He said in testimony during that case he is $10 million in debt.”
If the second Trump presidency has brought him financial relief and he can put up money for the campaign, he could become a top-tier contender for the Republican nomination for governor given his name recognition and daily production of media content selling himself and his products.

During the Idaho Legislature’s Legislative Council meeting Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, legislative leaders said they will convene the 2026 legislative session Jan. 12 and hope to adjourn for the year March 27, though there is no official deadline to end the session.
If they hit the nonbinding adjournment target, the legislative session would run 74 for days, which would be the shortest session since 2014.
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said he expects the session to be short because of budget cuts and the 2026 election, where all 105 seats in the Idaho Legislature will be up for election. 
“Generally, when we have years like this where the budgets are tight we’ll get things done faster because we don’t fight amongst ourselves as much,” Moyle said. “There’s nothing to fight over. So hopefully we can move that date up. This is an election year, and I assume that everybody around this table is going to be a target of somebody.”
High-stakes party primary elections take place in May, and legislators generally look to wrap up legislative sessions early in election years so they can return to their districts and campaign.

 Revenues are lagging behind projections in the state budget

State budget and revenues are also likely to be a major issue during Idaho’s 2026 legislative session. 
Through the first two months of the current fiscal year 2026, state revenues have come in $22.6 million, or 2.8%, below the state’s revised forecast.
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Idaho Legislature cut state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money state officials have to spend in the state budget, and the Idaho Constitution prohibits expenses exceeding revenues. 
Taxes are the largest source of state revenue in Idaho. 
Idaho state revenues continue to lag behind budget projections

To prevent a budget deficit, Gov. Brad Little announced that all state agencies – other than public schools – must cut 3% from their budgets in the current fiscal year. Little then made the 3% budget cuts permanent moving forward. 
Aside from the revenue shortfall and budget holdbacks, there are still other unresolved budget questions. 
There are about $109 million in general fund supplemental funding requests for the state of Idaho’s current fiscal year 2026 budget, said Keith Bybee, division manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office’s budget and policy division. 
The Idaho Legislature gets the final say on supplemental budget requests, which will be discussed during next year’s session.
Additionally, Idaho’s latest revenue and budget projections do not take into account the cost of conforming to the tax changes made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. 
“This is going to be an interesting year, because we’re going to be in a year where we’re going to be reducing budgets, and probably will be reducing taxes too because of some of the federal implications with the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Moyle said.
The nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated it could cost Idaho $167 million to conform to tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those tax changes include no tax on workers’ tips and no tax on workers’ overtime.
Because of the cost of revenue shortfalls, the supplemental funding requests and the cost of implementing the federal tax changes, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said the state could be facing a potential budget deficit of $200 million or more.
“This is not a disaster on the horizon; this is a disaster right now,” Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month.

PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillett announced her resignation last Friday after facing several legal challenges to her leadership from utility companies along with calls for her removal from Republican state lawmakers. Her departure leaves the authority with just two sitting members — Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — less than half of its statutory size of five.
Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to name Gillett’s successor as chair of PURA, and his promise to lawmakers to fill the remaining vacancies at the authority by the end of this year now faces even more urgency.
“I need some folks with really strong analytical capabilities,” Lamont said earlier this week, adding that recent headlines and turmoil swirling around the agency had complicated his recruiting effort. “People are worried about lawsuits and impeachment, so there’s some hesitancy. But we’re going to get it done as soon as we can.”
“It’s not for lack of will, it’s just trying to get the right person there,” he added.
The shakeup also opened new questions about whether PURA, with just two members, can vote and issue final decisions on rate cases or other pending matters. Currently, the authority is scheduled to issue final decisions later this year in three major cases: requests to raise utility rates by United Illuminating and Yankee Gas, as well as a proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
While Gillett initially announced that her resignation will take effect on Oct. 10, she later agreed to recuse herself from those pending cases after facing pressure from utility officials to do so.
A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to requests for comment this week.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor’s office, called the issue “a bit of a gray area.” Lamont’s staff have sought additional clarification on the law from the Attorney General’s office, he said, but are operating under the presumption that three members are needed for a quorum and that the governor will have to appoint at least one new member by Oct. 10. 
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong’s office said Thursday it has yet to weigh in on the matter. 
Representatives of both of the major utility companies with cases before PURA, meanwhile, urged the authority’s remaining members to resolve those matters through negotiated settlements that could make the questions around the quorum issue moot.
“The conduct of agency leaders, including the chair, remain significant issues in Connecticut state courts,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in statement. “The circumstances of the past few days are unique and are unfolding as critical decisions affecting gas, water, and electric customers are being adjudicated before the agency. It is important that this work continues. We are ready to collaborate and discuss resolutions to these matters, including negotiated resolutions, in order to avoid additional litigation and to move the state forward.” 
In addition to its electric utility, Eversource owns both the Yankee Gas Company and Aquarion Water Company. 
Cheryl Kimball, an attorney representing United Illuminating, made a similar plea during oral arguments in the company’s pending rate case on Thursday. The arguments were heard by the two remaining commissioners, Arconti and Caron.
“This is a significant factor counseling toward a consensus resolution,” Kimball said. “If there is a consensus resolution, there is no appeal and the questions on quorum are avoided.”
UI’s request for a $105 million rate increase is currently at the front of PURA’s pending docket. Before Gillett’s resignation, the authority released a draft final decision on UI’s request that would instead increase the company’s revenues by $28.6 million.
In response, UI’s Chief Executive Frank Reynolds publicly warned that PURA’s proposal could force the company to cut its investments in the local electric grid, resulting in worse reliability and longer outages during storms. In a filing with PURA, the company also said it would have to lay off 71 employees due to the loss of revenues.
During arguments on Thursday, Kimball went even further to attack the authority’s proposal, which she said was “fully compromised” by Gillett’s leadership. “Signing off on any part of this decision will simply buy PURA more new litigation,” Kimball said.
In order to avoid such an outcome, Kimball said the company was willing to negotiate a one-month extension to PURA’s Nov. 1 deadline to issue a final decision on the rate case to allow for more time to reach a settlement. A UI spokeswoman said Friday the company planned to file a motion for such an extension as soon as next week that would allow the utility to collect any new rates retroactively.
If no extension is agreed to or PURA does not issue a final decision in the rate case, then UI’s original request for a $105 million increase would take effect on Nov. 1, according to the spokeswoman, Sarah Wall Fliotsos.
Such an increase would raise utility bills for UI customers by almost 10%, according to estimates from the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which represents utility customers before PURA. 
The head of that office, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman, said on Thursday that she was open to having discussions with UI and other interested parties — which include the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and cable companies that utilize UI’s utility poles — about a possible extension. Absent such an agreement, however, she said the remaining two commissioners still have the power to render their own decision. 
“In the face of all then noise around this decision, we’re hoping that the authority is able to focus on the legal standards and the evidence,” Coleman said. 
In additional to the UI rate case, PURA is also considering Yankee Gas’ request to increase revenues by $192 million, or more than 26%. That is the largest such request by any gas company in the state over the last two decades, according to PURA.
In a draft decision released days after Gillett announced her plans to step down, the authority instead proposed a more modest increase of $41.5 million, or about 5.7%.
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said in statement that the company is continuing to evaluate the proposed decision. 
“It’s our obligation and responsibility to make sure that the system remains safe and reliable, and in order for that quality of service to continue, we must be able to make the necessary investments,” she said. “Certain aspects of this rate decision hinder our ability to continue to provide the same level of service.”
PURA has yet to issue a draft decision on the third major pending utility case involving the proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company. Critics of the sale, including Tong and the Office of Consumer Counsel, argue that the sale could result in higher water rates for the utility’s 685,000 customers in Connecticut.
Those cases included thousands of pages of briefs, public comments and financial documents submitted by the utilities and other interested groups.
Gillett’s departure has also renewed criticism of Lamont’s decision to avoid making additional appointments to PURA during her tenure.
Lamont appointed Gillett in 2019 and since then has made one additional appointment, Arconti, to fill the seat left by the retirement of former Democratic Commissioner Jack Betkoski. Caron, the board’s only Republican, is serving out a term that formally expired in 2022.
“We’ve reached a point where that authority can no longer operate, and electric rates are no lower, and in fact they are higher than they’ve ever been,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. “And I think a lot of this is by the governor’s own doing.”
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, who co-chairs the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, said he was unsure whether the law would allow PURA to operate with just two appointed commissioners.
But Steinberg was also an ardent support of Gillett’s leadership, and he said that her loss had “effectively hobbled” the authority. 
“I don’t like the look of it,” Steinberg said. “With decisions that are as important as the ones before them, I don’t think with only two commissioners we are looking at the kind of accountability that Connecticut residents are counting on.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GILLETT-HEARING-0220-01-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Last Friday, Green ordered Hoskins […]","Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins speaks to reporters in May 2024 during his time as a state senator (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Secretary of State Denny Hoskins on Friday pitched his first revision of ballot language for a Missouri constitutional amendment that would ban abortion — without mentioning the ban — at the Cole County Circuit Court. 
Next week, Judge Daniel Green will decide if it is a ball or a strike.
Last Friday, Green ordered Hoskins to rewrite the ballot language approved by lawmakers after finding it was “insufficient and unfair” because it failed to mention the amendment would repeal abortion rights. 
In his ruling, Green wrote that the original ballot title “fails to adequately alert voters that it would eliminate” the constitutional right to reproductive health care that Missourians approved last fall.
Under a law passed this year and upheld this week by Green, Hoskins had seven days to submit his revisions. Now, the two sides in the case have three days to submit analysis.
If Green rules Hoskins failed, he will have five days to try again.
The new ballot language written by Hoskins states in full: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and
miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Amend Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allowing abortions for
medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; and
Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

The reproductive rights amendment that Missourians narrowly approved last fall legalized all abortions up until the point of fetal viability. Access to the procedure remains limited as Planned Parenthood affiliates have sued the state over a series of abortion regulations that remain on the books. 
“My main focus has been protecting Missouri’s families and the Constitution,” Hoskins said in a statement Friday. “This ballot title and language reflects my commitment to upholding the values Missourians hold dear. My office remains dedicated to ensuring voters are presented with clear and accurate information as they consider this important measure.”
The ACLU of Missouri, which is leading the case challenging the ballot language, did not respond to a request for comment.

Green also told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.
Hoskins’ new summary states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors. 
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
After the Republican supermajority of legislators voted in May to put the amendment on next year’s ballot, the ACLU of Missouri sued, arguing that the ballot language was unfair and that the amendment illegally included unrelated subjects to be used as “ballot candy.”
Green in his ruling last week concluded that lawmakers did not err in combining bans on gender-affirming health care for minors with reproductive rights.

Scanlan, shown here on Oct. 29, 2024, said New Hampshire state law does not allow the voter registration list to be shared with a federal department. (File photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is suing New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, arguing he is illegally withholding the state’s voter file from federal officials. 
In a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, federal attorneys say Scanlan is violating the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by not turning the voter file over to the federal government. The department argues it needs the file to ensure that New Hampshire is carrying out necessary maintenance of the list to prevent voter fraud. 
The department is also suing California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania over the same request for the voter file. 
Scanlan has refused to hand over the state’s voter registration list. In a letter to the federal Department of Justice in June, Scanlan said New Hampshire state law does not allow the list to be shared with a federal department.
“New Hampshire law authorizes the Secretary of State to release the statewide voter registration list in limited circumstances not applicable here,” Scanlan wrote in the June letter.
He referred to RSA 654:31, the state law that allows the list to be given out to political parties, political committees, or candidates for elected office, upon request.
“That said,” Scanlan continued, “each municipality’s public checklist can be obtained from their respective supervisors or clerks.”
After federal officials again asked for the list, Scanlan sent a second letter on Aug. 28 that reiterated the arguments of the first.
In the lawsuit, Trump administration lawyers note that HAVA requires each state to have provisions in its election system “to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are updated regularly.” The Department of Justice is empowered to enforce that, which can include requesting the voter file, they argue. 
They also point to an unusually low percentage of duplicate registrations in New Hampshire, according to the “Election Administration and Voting Survey 2024 Comprehensive Report.” New Hampshire identified 0.1% of registrations as duplicates, and the national average was 12.7%, the lawsuit notes. 
The lawsuit asks the federal court to “declare that any state law that prohibits Secretary Scanlan from providing the requested statewide voter registration list is preempted by federal law,” and to order Scanlan to comply.
“The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is tasked with ensuring that states conduct voter registration list maintenance to prevent the inclusion of ineligible voters on any state’s voter registration list for federal elections,” the lawsuit states. “This action seeks to remedy the State of New Hampshire’s violations of federal voting laws.”
Neither Scanlan nor the New Hampshire Department of Justice commented on the lawsuit Friday. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State’s Office, Anna Sventek, confirmed that the office had received the lawsuit but said Scanlan would not comment further. 
Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, had a similar message. “We have received the complaint and are reviewing it,” he said Friday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5328-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Weston County voters want more exclusive representation in the Legislature, but several court cases have said otherwise. 
The post Lawmakers hear pitch on redrawing Wyoming’s legislative districts to give rural counties more say in the statehouse appeared first on WyoFile .","NEWCASTLE—Last year, Weston County attempted to send additional lawmakers to the Wyoming Legislature under the theory that one of the state’s least populated counties was underrepresented in the statehouse.
That effort didn’t succeed directly, but it did spur more discussions on the issue of rural representation, culminating Thursday in a group of Weston County voters making their pitch to lawmakers for redrawing the state’s legislative maps to adhere to county lines. 
County residents offered a variety of solutions, from weighted votes to dramatically expanding the number of lawmakers. But their message was similar: the state’s most rural communities need a bigger voice.
“It makes all the difference in the world to have someone from your county that knows your school boards, knows your sanitation issues, knows your local hospital district issues,” local resident William Curley told the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Reapportionment Committee. 
Since Wyoming’s legislative districts were redrawn in 2022 following the last census, Curley, an attorney, has led the charge for Weston County, with a population of fewer than 7,000 residents, to have its own senator and representative. Right now, Weston County’s four legislators also represent varying portions of Campbell, Crook, Goshen and Niobrara counties. 
“It’s got to be a hard job for a senator to represent more than one community of interest in Wyoming at the same time, equally on all things,” Curley told the committee. 
Curley and other supporters point to the Wyoming Constitution, which states, “each county shall constitute a senatorial and representative district” and each “county shall have at least one senator and one representative.” 
A legal challenge, however, upended that requirement in 1991 when a federal court ruled that Wyoming’s legislative maps violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution — also known as “one person, one vote.”
Since then, the Legislature has shifted away from strict adherence to county boundaries and toward population. While the approach has held up — including against a 2012 legal challenge — supporters of county-aligned legislative districts contend it’s costing rural voters their say.
They presented several proposals to the committee Thursday to shift back to county maps, including weighted voting in the Legislature as well as both reducing and expanding the number of lawmakers. 
While several proposals attempted to take the Equal Protection Clause into account, some residents actively pushed back on the legal rule that one person’s voting power ought to be roughly equivalent to another person’s within the same state. 
“Why should somebody that lives in an apartment in Cheyenne be able to run just as much as this state as a rancher out here that’s got 5,000 acres that’s paying probably 10 times the property tax that that person in there is?” Danny Bau asked the committee. “Where’s his representation?”
How we got here 
Weston County commissioners passed a resolution in April 2024 declaring two legislative vacancies in an attempt to redress their concerns regarding the absence of lawmakers representing their county alone. 
At the time, supporters of that movement said they expected other rural counties to follow their lead, including those that also lack exclusive representation in the statehouse. That includes Big Horn, Carbon, Crook, Hot Springs, Johnson, Niobrara, Sublette and Washakie counties. None ultimately did so. 
Following the resolution, the Weston County commissioners voted in October to select Curley and Karl Lacey to fill the seats they’d declared vacant, according to Newcastle’s News Letter Journal. 
The Wyoming Republican Party backed the process, but without a corresponding legal challenge, it failed to go any further. Meantime, the Wyoming Legislature passed Senate File 174, “Constitutional apportionment of legislators.” 
The new law created the subcommittee and requires lawmakers to study the topic of county-aligned legislative districts. It calls on the committee “to conduct meetings around Wyoming to take input on apportionment options from members of the public and other interested stakeholders.”

Newcastle meeting
Thursday marked the committee’s first meeting.
“I would like to thank you for providing this nice, calm venue to discuss this and not being right after a census and taking the time to do research and talk to us,” Tricia Baumann, another local resident, told the committee. “It’s really appreciated.”  
Baumann presented lawmakers with what she called a “population-adjusted legislative apportionment” that would rely on lawmakers using a weighted voting system in Cheyenne. 
Under the proposal, the state’s least populated county, Niobrara County, would have one representative in the House with a quarter vote on the floor. 
“Our point is the Niobrara citizens now have a person from their county sitting in Cheyenne speaking for the commissioners, speaking for the courthouse of Niobrara, speaking for the citizens of Niobrara, but understandably can’t put a lot of weight into the floor vote because their population is so small,” Baumann said. 
In all other aspects of the Legislature — including in committee meetings where bills must get approval to move forward — all lawmakers would have equal footing despite the size of the population they represent.  
More populated counties would elect more than one lawmaker in at-large races, meaning voters in places like Laramie and Natrona County would elect several lawmakers to represent the same area. 
That raised a concern for Torrington Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz. More specifically, Steinmetz worried what it would mean for voters living in the rural areas just outside the more populated areas. Such voters tend to vote more conservatively than voters in the nearby cities. 
“If they’re all at-large in Natrona County, what is to prevent Casper, the urban center, from electing all of the senators or representatives? Is there something in the proposal to address that?”
The proposal does not address that possibility, said Curley, who drafted the plan with Baumann. 
Curley pointed to another potential shortcoming of the proposal. 
“If you follow county lines, maybe it’ll be an issue with tribes under federal law,” Curley said. 
Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, represents the Wind River Indian Reservation. The district in Fremont County includes Lander, Ethete, Fort Washakie and parts of Riverton. 
“It captures all the places on the reservation and elsewhere where Native American people live,” Case said. “And so that was done very, very deliberately. Now, if all of a sudden that representation were based on the county line … there’s a potential for that Native American strength in their voting to be diluted.”
Case also pushed back more generally on the weighted-vote proposal. 
“Let’s go back to that example of Niobrara County,” Case said. If the county ends up with a representative with a fraction of a vote, “Are they really better off that way?”
Local resident Sue Mareles presented a second proposal to lawmakers called “The Founders’ Plan” that used a “formula” to determine the number of representatives and senators per county. 
“It is a nice hybrid plan that you don’t have a huge legislature and you also don’t have weighted voting,” Mareles said. “You have an individual — a whole person with a whole vote.”
Using Mareles’ formula, Niobrara County would have one representative, while the state’s most populous county, Laramie County, would have 11 representatives. 
The formula’s findings differed quite greatly from the legal memo and math completed by the Legislative Service Office ahead of the meeting. 
“If the smallest county—Niobrara with 2,467 residents at the 2020 census—was apportioned one senator, and each Senate district represented no more than 10 percent over 2,467 residents, the Wyoming Senate would need at least 213 members to meet the proportional requirements. The Wyoming House would then need at least 426 members,” the memo states. Currently, the Wyoming Senate has 31 lawmakers. The House has 62.
Mareles’ formula didn’t square for Case. 
“How is that fair in any sense of the way and how would that conform with the United States Constitution about having equal representation?” he said. 
Mareles pointed to a sentence on the last page of the proposal — “larger deviations require justification by legitimate state interests (e.g., preserving political subdivisions, avoiding gerrymandering).”
What now?
While the committee heard out voters, no lawmaker committed to any one proposal.
“I just want to thank all of you guys for how much hard work you’ve put into this and giving us so much to think about,” Steinmetz said. “And we may not come up with an exact solution tonight, but getting this discussion in depth is really good. And maybe it’s making you rethink some ideas, too.”
Steinmetz floated the idea of amending the Wyoming Constitution while Douglas Republican Sen. Brian Boner pointed to New Hampshire as a possible model for Wyoming to consider. Its chamber consists of 400 members. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, who attended the meeting, asked lawmakers to take the issue seriously. 
“Those are the real concerns that the people that I talk to every day are worried about, is the fact that our voice is diminishing quickly,” Neiman said. 
“So we’ve got to be wise about how we do this and how we respect those lines,” Neiman said. “Does the state of Wyoming have the guts to say we’re going to challenge the federal government on this because it’s hurting us the way we’re doing this? The way you want us to do this, ladies and gentlemen, is harming our state’s ability to be able to even function.”
The committee will hold another meeting sometime before its Dec. 1 deadline to provide a report to the Legislature. It had not been scheduled by publishing time.

Richard Blumenthal, who reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act, called on Meta to release its research about youth safety risks on the site.","A U.S. Senate hearing earlier this month — featuring whistleblower testimony from former researchers at Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta — offered an opportunity for Sen. Richard Blumenthal to reactivate his campaign for the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill that would require social platforms to do more to mitigate harms attributed to the ways children use their technology. 
Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford Friday, where he called for Meta to release its internal research about risks to youth safety and its parental safety tools. The remarks came two weeks after former Meta safety researchers testified to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law that the company covered up internal research that would have raised concerns about harmful effects on children of Meta’s virtual reality products.
“We are in the midst of a mental health crisis among young people that is aggravated and exacerbated relentlessly by social media,” he said, speaking outside The Village for Families & Children, which provides behavioral health services for children. 
Blumenthal has said his online safety bill, known as KOSA, would hold companies like Meta accountable and make more safety settings available on social platforms. “The research and the facts so far from these whistleblowers provide powerful documentation to the need for stronger measures for kids’ online safety,” he said.
While Congress is in the midst of a standoff over funding, Blumenthal said he’s hopeful for KOSA’s prospects once the funding issues are worked out.
But it’s already been a long road for the proposed bill. 
Blumenthal was first drawn to this issue in 2021 by another whistleblower — former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, who leaked documents showing Instagram’s effect on the mental health of teenage girls in 2021.
He first drafted the legislation, with Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, in 2022.
Last year’s version of the bill, which Blumenthal and Blackburn cosponsored, passed the Senate handily in a 91-3 vote. A reworked version passed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, but Congress adjourned before the full House could vote, requiring the process to start over again. 
Blumenthal and Blackburn reintroduced the bill this May. 
The bill would allow addictive features and algorithmic recommendations to be disabled by users. It would establish what’s referred to as a “duty of care” requirement for tech companies to prevent harms to minors on their sites, and require annual independent audits of these risks. It would also create an 11-member bipartisan council of academics, researchers, parents, and young people to provide recommendations.
Opponents have argued the bill could lead to censorship and free speech violations. Some groups focusing on privacy and LGBTQ+ rights voiced concerns that kids would be cut off from support resources only accessible to them via social media.
The bill has been revised several times and has picked up support along the way from a range of tech industry leaders including Apple and Elon Musk.
Some initial critics turned around to support a rewritten version of the bill that tweaked who could enforce its “duty of care” provision.
NetChoice — a trade association that represents Meta and dozens of other technology companies — has called KOSA unconstitutional, stating in handout materials that the bill is “compelling companies to restrict protected speech” and arguing that “parents will be replaced by a council of big government bureaucrats.” The group did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Others remain unconvinced, such as Fight for the Future, a digital rights group led by queer and transgender women. The group hired a billboard truck in June to criticize how KOSA could limit access to resources about reproductive health and gender-affirming care for kids.
Blumenthal said he expects the Senate to vote on the bill before the end of this year.
But pushing House leaders to hold a vote remains a challenge. Blumenthal said that he and Blackburn have meetings with House members planned in D.C. this week to discuss the bill. He said Blackburn is leading those meetings because her party holds the House.
He said he also hopes “allies in the White House” will press House leadership to hold a vote.
Speaking alongside Blumenthal on Friday, Laine Taylor, chief medical officer, said she supports the bill because she sees the negative effects of social media use in children she works with.
“There are lots of discussions around limitations being put on social media,” Taylor said. “So much of it is put on parents, and there’s only so much you can know.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9598-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges that on Sept. 4 and Sept. 6 of last year, registered nurse Brycen  Allen Meyer of Fairfax arrived for work at University of Iowa Health Care’s Urology Clinic while impaired by alcohol and/or “substances not prescribed” to him. The board also alleges Meyer engaged in “unwelcomed physical contact with another staff member” when he grabbed a co-worker’s wrist.

The board has charged Meyer with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
To resolve the case, Meyer recently agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists individuals with substance abuse or alcohol issues.
Other Iowa nurses recently sanctioned by the board include:
— Licensed practical nurse Ecco Schwartz of Shell Rock, who was issued a warning and ordered to complete 30 hours of educational training on nursing documentation after being charged with failure to assess or evaluate the status of a patient. The board alleged that while working at an unspecified rehabilitation center, Schwartz improperly documented that she had administered medication to a patient that was actually administered by another nurse, that she “left treatments in two residents’ rooms,” and that she left a medication cart unlocked and unattended.
— Licensed practical nurse Kayla Waskow of Decorah, who was charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient, and engaging in behavior that was contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that in April 2024, Waskow’s employer, whom the board has not publicly identified, conducted a random audit of staff access to the electronic health records. As a result of the audit, the employer allegedly found that Waskow had accessed multiple patients’ records for no job-related purpose. Waskow allegedly admitted she had done so in an effort to track the patient census at her place of employment. The board issued Waskow a warning.
— Registered nurse Shawn Dale Friedrich of Peosta, who was recently charged with misappropriating medications or property belonging to a patient or clinic. The board alleges that in January 2025, Friedrich was found to have a variety of medications in his backpack, including lidocaine, bupivacaine, and other substances — some of which, the board alleges, had not been prescribed to him. According to the board, Friedrich stated he had taken the medications from kits in the emergency department that would have otherwise been discarded, and that any medications he ingested were limited to those prescribed to him. To resolve the case, Friedrich agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program.
— Registered nurse Regan Lind Cairney of West Des Moines, who was recently charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that on Jan. 2, 2024, three individuals were transported to and cared for in the emergency department and intensive care unit at the Des Moines hospital where Cairney worked. The hospital later ran an audit to find out who accessed medical records for the patients after their arrival and found that Cairney had accessed records for two of them for no legitimate purpose. According to the board, she was fired from the hospital. To resolve the licensing board charges, Cairney agreed to a settlement that calls for her to accept a warning and complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.

Kay Ivey announced Friday afternoon that she will not call a special session to redraw Alabama’s State Senate map following a federal court ruling that the current map violates the Voting Rights Act.
“As the law currently stands, states like Alabama are put to the virtually impossible task of protecting some voters based on race without discriminating against any other voters based on race,” Ivey said in a statement released Friday. “I remain hopeful that we will somehow find the ‘magic map’ that will both satisfy the federal court and also be fair to all Alabamians. But as of today, I cannot justify the time and expense of calling a special session.”
The move could set up another confrontation over redistricting with the federal courts, two years after judges ordered the drawing of new congressional maps after finding the Legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act and later failed to come up with an adequate map to allow Black Alabamians to meaningfully participate in the political process. 
The ruling came out of a lawsuit challenging the state’s redistricting decisions in 2021. Messages seeking comment were left with the plaintiffs’ attorneys Friday afternoon.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, ruled last month that the state could draw another majority-minority or near-majority minority Senate district in the Montgomery area. She outlined two possible scenarios earlier this week for her order to be upheld: a special session, or a court ordered map. 
Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the case, appealed Manasco’s ruling, citing the Supreme Court’s expected ruling in Callais v. Louisiana,  which challenges the constitutionality of majority-minority district.  Ivey also mentioned the case in her statement.
“In the meantime, I call on the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify the law in this area as soon as possible and relieve states like Alabama from this no-win situation,” the statement from Ivey said.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 upheld a lower court ruling — in which Manasco played a part — ordering Alabama to draw at least one additional congressional district that was majority-minority or close to it. The state Legislature that July approved a map that the panel called unresponsive. The state appealed but lost again at the U.S. Supreme Court, which led to a court-appointed special master drawing new congressional maps.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board will commit to reviewing cannabis advertisements within a five-day timeframe and give retailers more leeway to advertise on social media, among other changes, as part of the deal.

Vermont’s cannabis regulator will ease some of its restrictions on how retailers can market their products as part of a settlement announced this week with a cannabis dispensary in Middlebury and a statewide group that lobbies for the cannabis industry.
The deal resolves a lawsuit that FLŌRA Cannabis and the Vermont Cannabis Action Fund brought against the state’s Cannabis Control Board last December. The civil case, filed in Addison County Superior Court, argued that Vermont’s cannabis advertising rules infringed on retailers’ constitutionally protected rights to free expression.
A judge still needs to sign off on the settlement, which is expected to happen within the next several days, Dave Silberman, co-founder of FLŌRA Cannabis, said Friday.
The settlement “provides immediate, meaningful relief to an industry that has earned the right to be treated with respect rather than contempt, and avoids a lengthy and expensive trial,” Silberman said in a Thursday press release announcing the deal.
Existing Vermont law requires the Cannabis Control Board to approve advertisements that retailers have designed before those ads can run. That generally won’t change under the settlement, though the board now has a limited time window to do its review. If regulators don’t make a decision on whether an ad is permissible within five business days, the ads will automatically be granted approval.
The settlement also gives cannabis retailers more leeway to market on social media. They’ll now be allowed to advertise specific products on their feeds, provided the ads do not use images of those products. As part of the deal, retailers will also have to give the board a list of all of their feeds so that regulators can keep an eye on those posts.
Another measure in the settlement will reduce the frequency with which retailers have to get state approval for recurring ad campaigns, such as a weekly newsletter. Now, once the board signs off on a basic template for recurring ads, that approval will be valid for a year. That limits the possibility of a retailer needing to get each individual installment of an ad campaign approved by state regulators.
The control board has also agreed to develop a shorter version of a warning describing potential health risks from consuming cannabis that’s required to be part of retailers’ TV and radio ads. James Pepper, the board’s chair, said the current warning takes about 30 seconds to read, but the board is working on a new version, in conjunction with the state Department of Health, that could be read in five seconds or less.

Pepper said Friday that, overall, the control board is happy with the settlement and noted the changes would reduce some of the workload for his staff, too. 
“What we agreed to is actually, I think, a really common sense approach — a pathway forward that maintains the intent of what the (Vermont Legislature) wanted with respect to cannabis advertising, while reducing administrative burden, both internally and for the cannabis industry,” he said.
Pepper and Silberman said they expect to continue discussing changes to the state’s cannabis regulations with lawmakers when Vermont’s 2026 legislative session starts in January. All of the changes included in this week’s settlement impact how the control board enforces the state’s laws, not the underlying legal language itself.
Silberman said Friday that he and others in the retail cannabis industry are eager to eliminate the requirement that they submit their ads for regulators’ review entirely, a process they see as “blatantly unconstitutional.” He said he wants cannabis to be regulated like other similar industries, such as alcohol production.
“This is a top priority for the industry,” he said. “We do good for this state — and it’s time for the Legislature to recognize that, and stop treating us like we are a threat to society.”

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin) New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and the New Mexico State Bar say immigrant communities in New Mexico should be wary of a recent scam: Fraudsters who pretend to be immigration attorneys and contact people online. 
Torrez, in a news release Friday morning, said the office is seeing “rising numbers” of online scammers posing as legitimate lawyers. The scammers directly message people online via social media and may use the names and license numbers of real attorneys. 
“These scammers go to great lengths to deceive people, targeting immigrant communities seeking legal help,” Torrez said in a statement. “They use sophisticated schemes to gain trust and steal money.”

The fake lawyers are not only scamming people out of money, according to Torrez’s office. They have also reportedly given bad legal advice, causing some of their clients to miss appointments or hearings, according to the news release. 
Torrez’s office offered tips to consumers about detecting these scams. For one: Contacting individuals directly to offer legal services in exchange for money violates the state’s Rules of Professional Conduct. So any supposed lawyer reaching out directly to someone via social media “is likely a scam,” according to the news release. 
Consumers should also be skeptical of purported immigration attorneys who:

ask for money via gift cars, Bitcoin or apps like Venmo;
make an offer that sounds too good to be true; or
rush consumers to sign contracts or threaten them with deportation

Because the scammers sometimes use the names or license numbers of actual lawyers, the AG also recommends consumers contact the State Bar for help assessing the attorney’s legitimacy, or contact the named attorney directly. 
The office also released fact sheets about the scam in English and Spanish.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

(Screenshot from campaign ad)Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien is dropping his bid for governor after a turbulent week for his campaign, saying he doesn’t see a way for him to win the Republican nomination. 
Berrien, the owner and chief executive officer of Pindel Global Precision Inc. and Liberty Precision New Berlin and a former Navy SEAL, entered the race about three months ago, saying the state needed a businessman in charge and trying to compare himself with President Donald Trump as a way of appealing to people. 
His exit leaves two Republicans in the race: U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the highest-profile candidate, launched his campaign this week, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann launched in May. 
Berrien cited two reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week as his reason for leaving the race, saying they were “clearly targeted to force me out of the race.” 
“As a result of our politics today, I cannot focus on the issues I know will turn Wisconsin around. I have come to the conclusion I do not have a path to the nomination,” Berrien said in a statement.
The Journal Sentinel articles found that Berrien had scrubbed his activity on the online publishing platform Medium.com where he followed Jiz Lee, a queer, trans nonbinary adult film performer, along with other authors of sexually explicit essays. Berrien had entered the race boasting of his conservative values, including saying he’d “keep boys out of our daughters’ sports and locker rooms,” a reference to the issue of transgender girls participating on girls’ sports teams. 
The Berrien campaign attempted to downplay the news this week, but it quickly traveled across the internet, even garnering the attention of Jiz Lee, the Journal Sentinel reported in a follow-up article. They wrote in a post on Bluesky it is “okay to follow trans porn stars” and “to read articles about sex and relationships,” but that “what’s not okay is the hypocrisy of backing forceful legislation that restricts what people, trans and otherwise, can do with their own bodies.” 
“That is shameful,” they said. 
Berrien downplayed his online activity in his statement, saying he followed over 5,000 people across various platforms, subscribed to over 100 newsletters and has hit the ‘like’ button on 20,000 posts.  
“It was a major attack piece and we confirmed opposition research started in January of this year, if not earlier,” Berrien said. “And for what? For reading! Nothing illegal, nothing unethical and nothing immoral. Just reading. Wouldn’t you want your political and business leaders (and all of society, frankly) to be widely read and thoughtful and aware of different perspectives and ideas? Yet, when a supposedly major metropolitan newspaper condemns someone for reading, we have ourselves a problem.” 
The primary for the open governor’s race, scheduled for August 2026, is still about a year out. 
Ahead of the news on his online activity this week, Berrien had already found pushback to his candidacy from Trump-aligned conservatives because he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, including donating over $30,000 to her campaign.
Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman highlighted Trump’s influence  in the Republican primary in a statement about Berrien’s exit, saying it is a “lesson” for GOP candidates. 
“If you don’t show complete and total loyalty to Trump — past or present — then you better pack your bags and head for the door,” Shulman said. “His failure, despite his resume, financial investment, and doing somersaults to earn Trump’s love, shows just how far the other GOP candidates are going to have to go to win the nomination.” 
While the Republican field is shrinking, the Democratic field for governor is still growing with at least eight candidates in the race. 
Announced Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former state Rep. Brett Hulsey and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.

Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves, and Democratic businessman Darden Copeland each made six-figure loans to their U.S. Congressional campaigns, financial disclosure reports filed on Sept. 25 show. 
The trio’’ self-funding accounts for just under half of the $2.5 million raised by the eight major candidates from both parties ahead of the October 7 primary. 
The primary winners will face off in a December 2 special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who stepped down from his seat in July after winning reelection in November. The 7th district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. 
In the GOP primary 12 candidates are running, but Bulso, Reeves — both of Williamson County — state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps are considered the frontrunners. 
Throughout the campaign, the four Republican candidates have made clear that they plan to back President Donald Trump’s agenda. The four have collectively raised around $1.7 million.
Candidates for the Democratic nomination in Tennessee’s Congressional District 7 special election participated in a Nashville forum on Sept. 9. From left, Rep. Vincent Dixie, Rep. Aftyn Behn, businessman Darden Copeland and Rep. Bo Mitchell.
The Democratic primary includes Copeland and Nashville state Reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. The Democrats all want to serve as a check to the Trump administration and have been primarily debating who is best equipped to win the general election in a district rated as solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report, which provides independent, nonpartisan analysis of congressional elections.
Green won the past two elections for the 7th District by the same margin of roughly 20 percent. 
Collectively, the four Democratic candidates raised about $825,000.
As of Sept. 25, around 16,500 voters had cast a ballot in the primary election as part of early voting, which ends on Oct. 2. 
How the Republican candidates compare
The four GOP candidates can be broken down into two groups. Reeves, Barrett and Van Epps have each raised a significant portion of their campaign from individuals, while most of Bulso’s campaign is self-funded.
Van Epps has raised around $360,000, the most of any Republican candidate when personal funds are excluded. Reeves brought in around $270,000, Barrett $235,000 and Bulso $55,000.
Reeves and Bulso are neck and neck in terms of overall funds raised, with a total of over $550,000 each. Bulso has put almost $500,000 of his own money into the campaign, and Reeves loaned himself $300,000. 
How the Democrats compare
Copeland leads Democrats in total money raised at around $435,000. About $125,000 comes from personal loans, and the remaining $300,000 is from individual contributions. He has raised the most in non-self funds, but about a third of his money has come from out-of-state donors. 
Mitchell has raised around $200,000, putting in $10,000 of his own money. Behn raised around $150,000 and Dixie brought in $140,000.

The move will “bring financial stability” to the publication, which loses about $160,000 per year, the office said in the news release.
“Goldenseal is one of the state’s most prized publications, and we are excited to see it evolve into a publication that is free and accessible to all,” Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said in a news release. “For 51 years, the magazine has told stories of West Virginia’s people and heritage, and, as of this week, those stories — going back to its first edition published in the 1970s — are available online at no cost. This new platform also gives us the ability to add multimedia content and begin working with students around the state who are eager to contribute stories about our history and culture.”
She added that the new site will remove the paywall, giving readers free unlimited access to some of the state’s most prized traditions.  
“We look forward to sharing these treasured stories with a larger audience for years to come,” Ruby said. 
Ruby previously told West Virginia Watch the magazine, which was first published in 1975, had lost $640,000 in taxpayer money over the past five years because of declining subscriptions and rising postage and printing costs. 
The number of subscriptions has declined from its peak of more than 30,000 to fewer than 4,000 today, she said. 
Besides the new format, the magazine will also partner with universities and schools — beginning with West Virginia University at Parkersburg and Glenville State University — to increase content on the site. The student-written articles highlighting the youth of Appalachia will appear alongside pieces from the paid contributors who have worked with Goldenseal for years, the news release said.
Each year, a commemorative book will be published with print versions of the magazine’s content and sold at a price that will cover production costs, the news release said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced Thursday that Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. soldiers for their role in the Wounded Knee Massacre will not be rescinded.
The massacre occurred on Dec. 29, 1890. Lakota people were camped near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and chaotic shooting ensued.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
Hegseth used the word “battle” to describe the massacre.
“Under my direction, we’re making it clear, without hesitation, that the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 will keep their medals,” Hegseth said in a video posted to social media. “And we’re making it clear that they deserve those medals. This decision is now final, and their place in our nation’s history is no longer up for debate.”
Defense secretary orders review of Wounded Knee Massacre medals

Hegseth’s predecessor during the Biden administration, Lloyd Austin, created a panel last year to review the medals. At the time, the Defense Department said “approximately 20” soldiers had received a Medal of Honor for participating in the massacre. Historians have noted that the records associated with some of the medals are incomplete or unclear.
There was no public report from the panel and no public action on the matter by the Biden administration before Biden left office. Hegseth held up a report in his social media video that he said was generated by that panel in October, but the Defense Department has not published it. A request from South Dakota Searchlight for the report is pending with the department.
“Upon deliberation, that panel concluded that these brave soldiers should, in fact, rightfully keep their medals from actions in 1890,” Hegseth said.
Hegseth alleged the prior administration was too concerned with being “politically correct” to share a final decision. 
Oliver “OJ” Semans, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member who advocates for the revocation of the medals, said he wasn’t surprised by Hegseth’s statements. Semans said he felt the review panel’s makeup was skewed toward protecting the military’s image.
“I think it’s a shame that Secretary Hegseth was misled by his predecessor’s report,” Semans said.
Past efforts to rescind the medals through congressional action have failed. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, introduced another bill to do so this year.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, was at a public event Friday in Rapid City, about 90 miles from Wounded Knee. Thune said the decision was Hegseth’s to make and that the decision was supported by an “independent review.”
South Dakota Searchlight asked Thune if he agreed with Hegseth’s use of the word “battle” and Hegseth’s statement that the soldiers “deserve those medals.”
“Whenever you’re talking about those types of events in our nation’s history, you need to do it in a respectful way,” Thune said. “I didn’t watch what he said, but like I said, I think the decision that he issued is the one that everybody will end up having to adhere to.”

Warnock and several other lawmakers commissioned a Government Accountability Office report which found that Georgia spent $54.2 million in less than five years to administer the country’s only Medicaid program with work requirements (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Georgia spent $54.2 million in less than five years to administer the country’s only Medicaid program with work requirements – more than twice as much as it spent to provide health care to enrollees, according to an analysis released earlier this month by the Government Accountability Office.
The report suggests it will be expensive to implement the Medicaid work requirements included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
Under that law, the 40 states plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act must require the expansion population – low-income adults under 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level – to either work or engage in other activities such as job training or higher education for at least 80 hours per month.
The law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $911 billion over the next decade, largely because the new work requirements will push people off the rolls. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
Supporters say the work requirements will encourage people to get jobs that offer health care coverage. But critics argue that most Medicaid recipients already work, and that most people who lose coverage will be dropped because they fail to meet the reporting requirements.
In October 2020, Georgia received federal approval to test Medicaid work requirements for an initial 5-year period. Its program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, is available to people between the ages of 19 and 64, with incomes at or below the federal poverty level, who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaid. Georgia originally planned to begin enrollment in July 2021, but legal challenges delayed implementation until July 2023.
As of May 2025, Georgia reported that 7,463 people were enrolled, far fewer than the 25,000 the state had expected to enroll during the first year of the program.
Between 2021 and June 2025, Georgia spent $54.2 million on administrative costs, compared with $26.1 million on providing medical care, according to GAO. About $50.8 of the administrative spending went toward changing the state’s system for determining people’s eligibility and enrolling them. In addition, the state used $20 million it received under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to advertise the program.
Georgia officials told GAO that the pause in implementation forced them to do some things twice, raising administrative costs by between 20% and 30%. This included IT system changes, coordination with other agencies, and staff training.
“Every state Medicaid program is different, and so the amount or proportion of administrative costs that states may have to upgrade their systems and implement the new work requirements can vary by state,” Michelle Rosenberg, the GAO health care director, said in an interview.
“I suspect some states may require less administrative spending, and other states may require more. But I do think this is the best information we have available on what states’ experiences may be like.”
The Georgia Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia Pathways to Coverage, did not respond to multiple Stateline requests for comment.
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the lawmakers who requested the GAO report, said it proves that Medicaid work requirements are a waste of taxpayer dollars.
“This report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,” the Democrat said in a news release. “If Republican politicians were serious about getting people to work, they would have closed the coverage gap nationwide and cut out the government bureaucracy.”

More than $1 million dollars of the water development funds had been designated for religious-specific education and enrollment of students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker, a college based in Steubenville, Ohio. 
“Said distributions are unconstitutional as they violate the establishment clause of the West Virginia and U.S. Constitutions,” Kanawha County Circuit Richard Lindsay wrote in the order Thursday.
Lindsay granted a motion for summary judgment to the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and the American Humanist Association, who filed suit in January against the Water Development Authority to stop it from issuing the grant to Catholic school.
The state’s Water Development Authority had approved giving $5 million to the Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college in 2024 to expand into West Virginia and to create a conservative think tank without a required recommendation from one of three state officials. The grant was first reported by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and the News and Sentinel. 
In the lawsuit, the organizations argued that in granting the money to the Ohio-based school, the Water Development Authority abdicated its duties of providing financial assistance to West Virginia communities to protect water quality and public health and encourage economic growth. The move also violated the guarantee of freedom of religion codified in the state constitution, they said.
In July, Lindsay sided with the ACLU and American Humanist Association, saying the Water Development Authority had violated the state constitution by giving the public money to the Catholic school.
The judge gave the Water Development Authority 30 days to show evidence of its compliance with the constitution, the ACLU said.  
The Water Development Authority has complied with his order, Lindsay said in a new order, prompting him to grant plaintiffs’ request for summary judgment in the case.
According to the order, the Water Development Authority grant money in question will now be used for “real estate acquisition, site development, construction, infrastructure improvements, supplies and equipment for workforce training.” 
In his order, Lindsay wrote that, “… as long as a state-approved grant is used for non religious purposes and is a benefit available to the public, said grant is constitutional.” 
In a press release, American Humanist Association Executive Director Fish Stark said the group still questioned the decision to offer state subsidies to religious schools.
“We’re satisfied that the court found the original grant unconstitutional and maintained that  state funds cannot be spent on religious instruction or sectarian advocacy in the future, even if the funding restrictions could have cut deeper,” Stark said. “This was always an affront to West Virginian taxpayers, which is why we took action when our members saw this blatant violation of church state separation happening in their community.”

Students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker earn a Bachelor of Arts in Catholic Studies while also receiving training in several trades, including carpentry, HVAC and plumbing. According to Lindsay’s order, a letter from the college acknowledged that the grant money wouldn’t be spent on religious advocacy of any kind or teacher salaries.
“No question of constitutional law or infirmity remains,” Lindsay wrote in the order.
The state’s Water Development Authority was created in 1977 by the state Legislature to provide grants and loans to local governments and public services districts for construction of water and wastewater infrastructure. The board also uses the funds for economic development projects across the state. 
Following Lindsay’s order, ACLU-WV Advocacy Director Rusty Williams said in a news release, “Tens of thousands of West Virginians lack access to clean drinking water, and it is  unconscionable that their tax dollars were intended to go to an out-of-state entity for purposes  that would have violated our constitution.”
“We call on the state to prioritize the needs of West Virginians, not the wants of religious institutions, in future decision-making,” he said.

LANL completed the venting of containers, releasing very little tritium according to state environmental officials. (Courtesy of LANL)Los Alamos National Laboratory and federal officials completed the depressurization of four containers that were potentially building up pressure, and released only a small amount of the radioactive gas tritium into the air, state environment officials said on Friday.
In 2016, LANL officials discovered the drums were building pressure, could potentially explode and, in a worst-case scenario, release tritium at a rate double the airborne radiation limit for the whole year. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear research. The EPA characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin, and is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water — a replacement of one of the hydrogen molecules with tritium.
Instead, officials found the containers were fully sealed and intact, according to reports from the National Nuclear Security Administration to the New Mexico Environment Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which monitored the release. Depressurization was delayed several times by rain, and started on Sept. 16 and ended on Sept. 23.
“From the data we collected, received and reviewed, we really just don’t have any belief that there was any concerns for public exposure to the tritium at levels above background in the area,” Hazardous Waste Bureau Chief, John-David Nance told Source NM.
The NNSA reported total emissions to be around 0.005 millirems — much lower than radiation exposure of 3.7 millirems from a cross-country flight.
Anti-nuclear and indigenous groups criticized LANL and federal officials for a lack of transparency around the  plan to depressurize the containers and said their safety concerns were ignored.
The state required LANL to have a stricter “hard stop limit” as a nod to the concerns for exposure limits for children and pregnant women.
New Mexico Environment Department approves LANL plan to vent radioactive gas

NMED posted daily updates on social media about the release,  as Nance said the state wasn’t “exactly satisfied with LANL’s communications,” in the days leading up to the releases.
The NNSA and laboratory are required by state officials to issue a report about the depressurization and hold a meeting within the 30 days as part of the requirements from the state.
Nance said additional samples collected off-site by the New Mexico Environment Department will be released to the public in three to five weeks, after being verified.
“Recorded emissions we have were very low, but we’re are working to verify that with a third-party,” Nance said.

A friend stepped in to help, letting the family use her garden tap, but the experience has raised concerns about how prepared the town is to support community members during a drought.

A family of five in Northfield has been without running water for 12 days.
When the spring water they rely on at their home trickled to a stop on Sept. 9 because of the state’s ongoing drought, Kelly Murch said she started to call around for options.
And with three children — ages 2, 7 and 11 — it’s been “a weird time,” she said. Like living in “Little House on the Prairie,” a TV series based on a book about a 19th-century homesteading family.
At first, their neighbor helped them out by lending a large tank and his truck. With permission from the town, they filled up four times at the spigot in the community garden and paid $5 per round. 
Murch and her husband ran a garden hose from the filled-up tank through a window to a big old water cistern in their basement, which is working well thanks to gravity, she said, even though it’s “not very elegant.” 
Then, on Wednesday, the town turned the water off in the garden, Murch said.
Town Manager Jeff Schulz said he regretted that the community garden spigot had to be shut down. The town needed to cut the access due to fears of tampering or unintended contamination, he said, something state regulators say is a real concern. 
“We need to protect the water system and should not allow for limited and unmonitored access to the system without a policy,” Schulz wrote in an email. “Thus far we have provided that resident with about 400 gallons of water and we do very much sympathize with the residents being without water.”
Luckily, Murch and her family were able to turn to a community member and friend for help. On Friday morning, they filled up the tank at a friend’s yard in town. 
“I was really concerned initially,” said the friend, Sarah Eath, “because we didn’t know where they were going to get water from. And I was worried they wouldn’t be able to stay in their house.” She is glad now it’s “more of a limited water than no water” situation.
Murch and her family have to be very mindful about their water use, Murch said. They are taking their wash to a laundromat, though it is time-consuming and expensive; saving gray water from dishes for reuse; and taking really short showers. All of it is particularly hard with a 2-year-old who is being potty trained, she added. While they were teaching her to flush before the water shortage, now they are telling her not to.

In Northfield for four years, Murch is grateful she has the support of friends and neighbors. But she is worried about others, particularly older residents, who may not be as lucky and are without water during what is being called a historic drought across Vermont and the Northeast. She’s also not happy the town hasn’t been more proactive about informing residents about the drought, water conservation and options for potable water. 
Murch, who worked as a disaster response instructor with the Red Cross in Washington state before she moved to Vermont, said she is shocked the town doesn’t have an emergency plan for drought in place and hasn’t better informed residents about the ongoing drought. 
“Water is just so essential, you know,” Murch said. “It boggles my mind the fact that there is not an organized effort to go door-to-door and check on residents, or out-of-town people who don’t have water and don’t know what to expect because they haven’t been notified that there’s anything going on.”
According to Northfield’s All-Hazards Mitigation Plan, updated in 2023, the town does have a municipal emergency response plan but flooding — not drought — is the major focus. The 2023 document does suggest the town “should consider what, if any, actions should be considered based off best practices related to drought, mitigation, state guidance, and risk.”

Montpelier and Barre are among communities that have issued water conservation alerts as a result of the drought conditions playing out across the state. As of Thursday, almost 70% of the state, including Washington County, remains in a severe drought, and 24% of the state is in extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
“So really being smart about reducing water use is a really big thing” for people in the drought affected areas, said Ben Montross, drinking water manager for Vermont. This applies to residents who are not having issues now because they could potentially be affected too, he said.
The state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Montross, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of these, 77% of the reports represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well and 20% represent drilled wells.
He urged residents on community water systems to pay attention to notifications and guidance posted online by municipalities. Those who don’t have running water could also let their state representatives know, he said.
The state’s drought database maps at least six water outages in Northfield affecting residents who have private wells, reported between Aug. 25 and Sept. 1. Four of them are fed by spring water, two are wells.
Schulz, the town manager, said he has only heard from one — Murch. He encouraged all residents to call the town if they are facing a water scarcity problem.
On the job for more than 11 years, Schulz said he has never faced a situation where residents in Northfield have run out of water. He posted a brief advisory Monday on the town’s Facebook page asking residents connected to the town water system to be “mindful and conservative” in their water use.
“Northfield is fortunate that its water source consists of three very high yielding ground water wells and the wells continue to produce at normal levels,” the post states.
The town will discuss a policy and procedure to sell municipal water to residents or businesses at the Oct. 6 utility commission meeting, Schulz said, and address measures to ensure the public water system, which is highly regulated by the state, is protected. They will also discuss an emergency plan.
For alternate options, Schulz pointed to “a well-known source of spring water on Route 12A that is accessible to anyone at no cost” and private water haulers, which cost money. 
That public source on Route 12A is hard to access with large containers, and it is also flowing low currently, according to Murch.
Fresh well water is also available from an outside spigot at the Capital City Grange, according to Merry Shernock, vice chair of the selectboard.
Meanwhile, residents facing water shortages have been stopping in to buy water jugs, 5 gallon buckets and larger water containers at a longtime hardware store in town.
“I happen to have a spring still going, but I’m hearing about (other) people having issues,”  said Ray Fernandez, owner of Fernandez Hardware.
“Some of the basic stuff you can solve your problem with at the hardware store. For the rest, you have to wait for Mother Nature or wait for the drill company,” Fernandez said.
That’s another hard-to-come-by option in Vermont, according to Murch. She said she called about a dozen different contractors that dig wells in Vermont and found they are booked out months, through next year. Many of them are in Massachusetts or New York.
When she was poking around to find the cause of the water stoppage, she came across the state’s drought resources page created by the Agency of Natural Resources. She found there was funding available for residents interested in drilling a well, but there was an application deadline.
“We missed it by six days,” she said. “But we didn’t even know there was a problem until there was a problem.”
State officials said the Healthy Homes program — which predates the drought — closed on Sept. 3. They pointed to the Department of Environmental Conservation’s On-Site Loan program that does not currently have a deadline, and some other options that could help Vermont residents with water supply repairs.

One of the cases involves Kristal Klaahsen, previously known as Kristal Lake, who worked as a substance abuse counselor at Manning Regional Healthcare Recovery from November 2014 through September 2020.
While working in Manning, Klaahsen was accused of engaging in several inappropriate actions, including pursuing a sexual relationship with a client, requesting a client to undress in front of her, and engaging in a relationship with a client’s husband.
A Board of Behavioral Health Professionals investigation allegedly revealed that Klaahsen had sent a client, identified in board records as B.C., several inappropriate and sexually explicit texts, photos and videos. The client alleged that toward the end of his inpatient treatment, Klaahsen began flirting with him and the two exchanged sexually oriented text messages and conversed on Snapchat. The client alleged that when he later learned that Klaahsen was in a relationship with someone else he became angry and relapsed.
On May 10, 2021, the board charged Klaahsen with making suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks or advances to a client. Klaahsen later agreed to voluntarily surrender her social work license and wait a minimum of one year prior to seeking reinstatement.
On Feb. 24, 2025, Klaahsen filed a reinstatement request with the board. On April 29, 2025, the board notified her it intended to deny that request. The board alleged she had not only engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, but also claimed, without elaborating, that she had engaged in a sexual relationship with a client’s spouse and had breached client confidentiality
On May 28, 2025, Klaahsen appealed the board’s notice of intent to deny her application for reinstatement and requested a hearing. She argued she had learned from her mistakes and was successful in her current employment as a hospital discharge planner and had received an award for efficiency, advocacy and excellence.
At a July 29, 2025, hearing on the matter, Klaahsen testified about the therapeutic process she has undergone and the progress that she had made since surrendering her license.
“However,” the board stated in its recent, written hearing decision, “when pressed, Klaahsen would not directly speak about her interactions with B.C. … Instead, Klaahsen placed blame on B.C., a vulnerable client, for her relationship with him, testifying that he was the instigator of their relationship and that she felt ‘obligated’ to send him inappropriate pictures.”
The board commended Klaahsen for her progress but added that it did not believe she had “adequately addressed the issues that led to the voluntary surrender of her social work license.”
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Giovanni Demezier of Dyersville, who agreed to voluntarily surrender his license after being charged with unethical conduct, failure to comply with the national association’s code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a former client. The agreement follows a board decision in May to issue an emergency order suspending his license.
The board alleged that in early 2024, Demezier, while working as a licensed mental health counselor “in and around eastern Iowa,” began providing counseling services to a patient identified by the board as “T.S.” The board alleges that the client-counseling relationship between T.S. and Demezier ended in May 2024, but before that professional relationship ended, the two communicated with each other on Snapchat, with T.S. indicating she wanted something “more” in the relationship.
Demezier allegedly responded that he would have to switch from being a counselor to T.S. to a “coach,” while indicating the two roles were “virtually the same.” The board alleges Demezier then had sex with T.S. in June 2024.
T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father, according to board records. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
Court records show that on May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination. No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also claims that in 2021, Demezier began providing counseling services to a different client, M.R., and made repeated suggestive and flirtatious comments to the client before transitioning from a counseling relationship to “coaching” relationship in August 2023. In October 2024, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual conversation with M.R. via text message.
Demezier is currently being sued for negligence by Michelle Ross, a California woman who alleges that during their therapy sessions, Demezier disclosed information about his past and present clients, sent her late-night text messages, told her he was in “open marriage,” detailed his sexual activities and isolated her by discouraging her from maintaining relationships with her friends and family.
Demezier has denied the allegations. A trial-setting conference is scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
— Amanda Brune, who was recently notified of a board decision to deny her request to have her license reinstated. Board records show that in 2005, Brune, formerly known as Amanda Zwack, was accused of having close, personal relationships with clients and having sexual intercourse with one client while working for New Beginnings in Maquoketa and Clinton. The Iowa Board of Substance Abuse Certification subsequently revoked Brune’s certification.
In 2012, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science issued Brune a license as a mental health counselor. In January 2014, Brune pled guilty to the criminal charge of tampering with records, a charge that the board says stemmed from allegations that she had billed Medicaid for services provided to a family member during periods she was seeing clients for her employer. Brune then agreed to have her counselor’s license placed on probation for two years.
In early 2015, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science says, the board staff received an anonymous call asking why the board had licensed Brune as a mental health counselor when her certification had been revoked years earlier by the Board of Substance Abuse Certification. The Board of Behavioral Science then checked the IBSAC website, confirmed Brune’s certification had been permanently revoked in May 2005, and then revoked Brune’s license as a mental health counselor.
In March 2025, Brune applied for reinstatement of her mental health counseling license. In June 2025, the board indicated it intended to deny the application, which led to Brune requesting a hearing on the matter. That hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 20, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mental-Health-Counselor-Therapist-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will “immediately” take on the role of interim superintendent “until further notice,” the message stated, and he has the board’s confidence in his leadership. Smith formerly served in the role during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the message, after which Roberts was hired.
“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” Norris said. “The appointment of Mr. Smith as Interim Superintendent ensures that our District continues to operate at the highest level.”
Norris stated in the message the board will provide updated information once they receive and have confirmed it.
Roberts is a former Olympic Track and Field athlete, according to his LinkedIn account, and started his career in education in 2000. He has served in leadership roles at school districts in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.

(Photo credit: EPA)More than a month after a major industrial fire in Tangipahoa Parish, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released an inventory list identifying the millions of gallons of motor oils, automotive fluids and other petrochemical products at the site. 
The information was made public Thursday, hours after the Illuminator reported the agency was waiting on permission from the executives of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. plant in Roseland that was destroyed in an Aug. 22 chemical fire that took two weeks to completely extinguish. The explosion and blaze sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and a school. Petroleum products also spilled into nearby waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that leads to Lake Pontchartrain.  
Detailed on a 305-page spreadsheet, the list includes a variety of flammable and otherwise hazardous products. Rough estimates indicate Smitty’s Supply stored several million gallons of motor oils, lubricants, antifreeze, coolants, hydraulic fluids, gas mixtures, transmission fluids, methanols, drilling oils, solvents, acids, bases and other petrochemical products. 
With four locations across the South, the company bottles, packages and distributes bulk products to retail stores nationwide on behalf of major brands such as Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State, Chevron and Castro. 
EPA withholds list of chemicals in Smitty’s Supply fire, citing ‘confidential business information’

Smitty’s Supply also makes and bottles its own Super S brand of petroleum products and, before the fire, had bulk storage tanks on site with 8.7 million gallons of capacity. 
Its Roseland facility, just north of Amite City, also housed a grease manufacturing plant, automated bottling lines, laboratory and testing facilities, three rail spurs, 36 rail cars, a fleet of 18-wheeler trucks and tankers, as well a printing, labeling and packaging line, and other operations across multiple warehouses, according to the company’s website.
The EPA had possession of the list for more than four weeks after obtaining it from Smitty’s Supply on Aug. 27 and initially refused to disclose it to the public. At the time and in response to a reporter’s subsequent requests, the federal agency said it needed to check with the company’s lawyers to ensure the list didn’t contain any “confidential business information” that would be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The law compels government agencies to share qualifying records with the public.
“Legal counsel for Smitty’s Supply provided EPA with an inventory list of the materials at the facility, which was used to inform response operations,” EPA Press Officer Edward Mekeel said Thursday. “The inventory contained off-the-shelf motor oil, antifreeze, degreasers, plasticizers, polymers, and paints. After confirming that the list does not contain Confidential Business Information, EPA is now making the list publicly available.” 
The agency did not immediately respond to follow-up questions sent Thursday afternoon.

DemasA budget framework for the 2025-26 fiscal year is in place, but now the tough work begins, with eyes on Tuesday to produce a final product.
Michigan’s Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday evening announced that they reached a deal to fund the government in a stunning turnaround after months of standoff and stalemate, signaling that the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate worked out their differences and could move forward to avoid a government shutdown.
But the clock is still ticking and, by the respective chamber leaders’ own admission in statements that flew across newsfeeds late last night, there is much work still to be done to hammer out that framework into a full fledged consensus budget plan.
The details of what might make the final plan were still elusive on Friday, even to some key legislators, as leadership on both sides of the aisle were keeping things close to the vest so as to not upset the agreement.

House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said as much in a news conference he held after session on Thursday, noting that he could not answer some important questions related to the deal because other key players were absent. Hall also noted that he didn’t want to say anything that might undo the progress made because it was still just a framework – which was atypical for the usually freewheeling speaker.
On the Senate side, details of the framework were also being closely held to vest, said state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor).
It was notable, too, that both the House and Senate held sessions on Friday but both were adjourned quickly without any clear new budget activity. A flurry of unrelated bills were introduced, instead, some with an appropriations focus but those were for supplemental funding to programs that already exist.
Still, the lack of a quorum in the House and Senate shouldn’t be perceived as an early exit.
Communications staff for the House GOP told Michigan Advance on Friday that legislators were still very much meeting on Friday to do additional work on the budget behind the scenes. That included conversations amongst themselves but also with their Democratic colleagues.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Democrats appeared to be fully engaged in those conversations, as well, working at the Capitol and in the respective chamber office buildings negotiating targets and what they might look like. That includes hammering out the details of the school aid budget funding K-12 schools, which is another piece of vital budget information being held closely behind closed doors.
It was a whirlwind of activity following a lot of sitting around for months, but the conversations were bearing fruit and moving along.
The buzz in Lansing was hopeful, and that legislators would have a final deal hammered out to present on Tuesday, Sept. 30, the last day of the current fiscal year.
Of all the twists and turns of Thursday evening, the emergence of a plan to create a wholesale tax on marijuana at 24%, expected to generate $420 million to go toward roads, was an unforeseen development. Proposals to use “pot for potholes” stretched as far back as 2013, and now the House GOP of the 2025 session appeared to be the ones ready to take that plunge.
The House GOP also celebrated its “waste, fraud and abuse” mantra making it into the final budget deal.

For the Democrats’ part, there was barely a whisper of their supposed wins in the budget deal aside from the decoupling of Michigan’s state and the federal government’s business taxes, a move that would stave off some of the tax cut effects of the congressional One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
But one thing that was missed in Thursday’s announcement was the Democrats successfully protecting the statewide Medicaid exchange in the face of cuts from the federal government. Democrats on Friday touted that as another area where they won in the budget deal.
Another piece of information that caught the attention of those following the budget saga was a report from Bridge Michigan that noted interesting action from the Senate Democrats. The upper chamber’s leaders put forward an amendment on Thursday that would eliminate $500 million in annual funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which was Whitmer’s hallmark economic development engine through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
Bridge also reported that the House GOP put forward a bill to cancel corporate income tax deposits to the fund, opting to use that money toward roads.
Spurring economic growth has been one area that both parties agreed on, even if they differed on the concept of offering state taxpayer dollars as incentives for business attraction that might not bear fruit. The move on Thursday regarding the reserve fund was a sign that both Democrats and Republicans saw a clear need to shift money away from past priorities, and that the use of those state incentives to garner new business activity might be falling out of vogue.

Irwin, in a brief interview with the Advance, said he was still concerned that funding for education, health care and environmental protection could be on the chopping block to cover road funding.
“I haven’t seen the final numbers yet, so I can’t say, but it looks like those things are all going to be subject to cuts as a result of the shift of revenue towards roads,” Irwin said. 
While there will be other forms of revenue brought in to compensate for the increase in funding for roads, the rest will need to come from priority areas, and perhaps local governments.
“That’s kind of where it’s got to come,” Irwin said. “From some of those places. I guess it could come from prisons. … And so that’s concerning.”

Irwin was also critical of House Republicans’ plan to increase revenue by raising the tax on marijuana, arguing the effort would deliver less revenue than projected and would drive individuals toward the illegal market.
“When you drive customers out of the legal market, those are customers who are already contributing to roads, already contributing to K-12 schools, and already contributing to host communities. All of that’s going to be diminished by this action,” Irwin said.
As lawmakers met to solidify their loose deal, constituent and special interest advocacy continued on Friday.
In a news release from the pro-democracy Promote the Vote, the organization applauded the Legislature for getting to a deal, but urged lawmakers to protect election functions as critical infrastructure. The initial House GOP proposal included cuts to the Michigan Department of State and election administration.
Melanie Macey, the group’s policy and government affairs director, said those cuts would potentially threaten the state’s ability to run accessible, secure and efficient elections.
“They weaken election infrastructure and voter confidence, shift costs onto local governments, and would ultimately result in higher long-term costs,” Macey said in a statement. “The cuts would reduce early voting and Election Day support, damage election officials’ ability to provide required services, weaken voter roll maintenance and cybersecurity, and would have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable voters.”

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders officially called a special election Friday to fill the seat of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died earlier this month.
The Republican from Branch represented Senate District 26, which encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian Counties.
The special primary and general elections for the seat will be held on March 3 and Nov. 3 of next year, coinciding with the state’s regular midterm election schedule. If a candidate does not earn enough votes to win their party’s nomination outright, a special runoff election will be held March 31, 2026, the proclamation said.
State law requires that a special primary election be held “not more than” 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
The candidacy filing period for the special election will begin on Nov. 3, 2025, and will close on Nov. 12 at noon. Following the primary, parties must certify their nominee for the general election by Aug. 5, 2026.
Three Republicans have announced their intentions to run as of Friday — businessmen Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both of Paris, and former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
Simon and Tritt originally planned to run for the seat of term-limited Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, who represents House District 46. Three Republicans and no Democrats remain in the race for Eubanks’ seat.

Tritt immediately criticized the decision to hold the general election next November — after the state’s fiscal session in April.
“District 26 deserves to have a voice in every decision that impacts our families, our jobs, and our future,” Tritt wrote on Facebook. “To go through a fiscal session without full representation is simply unacceptable.”
Both he and Simon said they oppose plans for a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, in line with Stubblefield, who was one of the most outspoken critics of the project since it was announced last year. Berry, a military veteran who declined to run again in 2024 after two terms in the House, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he felt it was possible to fund a prison while finding a more suitable location for it.
Both Tritt and Berry also stated their opposition to a potential immigration detention facility at the Franklin County site, after reports emerged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had visited the site Monday and were considering it as a place to hold migrants.
In addition to their positions on the prison, policy priorities for the three ranged from cutting taxes and protecting Second Amendment gun rights to helping rural hospitals, improving workforce development and education.

The case comes amid an outbreak nationwide. So far this year, more than 1,500 people have tested positive, the highest number since the disease was considered eliminated in 2000. Three people have died: two in Texas and one in New Mexico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
South Carolina’s four cases have all come from unvaccinated people in the Upstate who had no immunity from prior infections, according to the department. For privacy reasons, the state does not release how old patients are, where they live or their sex.

Two of the people who tested positive previously had recently been out of the country. One of the cases was a close contact infected by another.
Where the most recent case came from is unclear, the department said in a news release.
The person isolated during the infection to keep the virus from spreading.
This marks the most measles cases in South Carolina since 2018, when the state had an outbreak in which six people tested positive. Before that, the last measles case was in 1997, according to health department data.

The highly infectious disease can be fatal, especially in children. Symptoms include a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually lasts about a week. In severe cases, the virus can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, according to the health department.
Most children receive two doses of a vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella between the ages of 1 and 6, according to the health department. About 94% of South Carolina children began the 2024-2025 school year with all their vaccines, according to health department data.
That’s a decrease from recent years.
During the 2019-2020 school year, more than 96% of students started the year vaccinated. Still, the state remained on par with the level of kindergarteners who received at least one dose of the vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the CDC’s most recent data available.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

If you need help, you can access resources through the University of Utah’s website or by calling the 24-hour rape recovery center crisis line at 801-736-4356. If you’re in immediate danger, call 9-1-1.
The University of Utah’s annual campus safety report shows staggering on-campus rape statistics for a second year in a row. However, like last year’s survey, most of the allegations were reported during a single interview with a survivor.
The state’s flagship school accounted for 146 rape cases in 2024, with a former student reporting 110 incidents by a single partner during a “multiple-month relationship plagued by interpersonal violence,” according to a news release from the U.
“Because each is a distinct action, then each counts individually, so that we counted the full 110 which is what the survivor stated that they had,” said Todd Justesen, director of the U’s Clery program, a federally required initiative to disclose campus crime data.

According to the report released on Friday, the survivor didn’t wish to move the case forward, and both people in the relationship have graduated.
This year’s count nearly rivals the university’s 2023 report, which counted 175 rape cases. That year, a single victim also reported being raped 150 times by their intimate partner at the Salt Lake City campus. Both numbers are substantially higher than the 30 cases reported in 2022. 
Chris Linder, a professor and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the university, said that while the numbers may be alarming, they can also help other victims of interpersonal violence to report sexual assault from intimate partners. 
“But many survivors do not come forward and report it as sexual assault, because our culture has constructed the idea of sexual assault as a stranger jumping out of the bushes and snatching us,” Linder said. 
The university doesn’t have exact statistics of accountability in these cases, but a university spokesperson said the school will refer students to different offices depending on whether they’d like to press criminal charges or student discipline, like expelling or suspension while the investigation takes place. 
The report also shows a significant increase in fondling, or inappropriate touching of the groin, buttocks or breasts, including during medical examinations, Justesen said. Fondling instances grew from 55 in 2023 to 83 last year. That included 51 cases at the U of U Health Hospitals and Clinics. 
All reports are counted whether or not the allegation was substantiated and someone was found accountable, Justesen added.



Let us know what you think...


 


The report also showed an increase in other forms of violence. Cases of aggravated assault, which includes any attack to inflict severe bodily injury, tripled from seven in 2023 to 21 last year. That included 14 in health care settings.
The U. also released the results of a campus climate survey on Friday, which aims to understand trends, patterns and needs among students with a focus on sexual harassment and misconduct. The report shows high confidence in bystander intervention during emergencies and a strong understanding of consent in sexual encounters.
University officials saw a silver lining in those results. 
“As we compare our rates to national benchmarks across almost all categories, we’re seeing lower rates of incidents reported for our students,” said Lori McDonald, vice president for student affairs at the university, “the exception to that being among intimate partner violence, which helps us, again as a campus, know that we should continue investing and building on those resources.
The university offers a range of educational programs and events throughout the academic year to better understand healthy relationships and how to intervene in potentially harmful situations, McDonald said. 
There’s a peer wellbeing navigation program available for students, as well as sexual violence resources. Anyone needing help is encouraged to call the 24-hour rape recovery center crisis line at 801-736-4356.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Twenty minutes was all it took for state regulators to cement the seasonal electricity rates that will hike Rhode Island Energy customers’ bills by an average of $22.28 per month for the next six months.
But the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s swift decision Thursday does not preclude the prospect of more discounts on winter utility bills — proposals for up to $180 million in credits on winter gas and electric bills remain under review. In a nod to the rising utility costs — and frustrations of the customers who struggle to pay them — the three-member panel also kicked off a first-of-its-kind request for public comment on other ways to flatten the seasonal price spikes. 
Electric supply rates typically increase every winter, reflecting the regular, seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. But the cyclical rollercoaster has grown more dramatic in recent years because of global unrest and increasing demand for natural gas.
The 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price that starts Oct. 1 is 16.05% more than existing summer prices. But, it’s nearly 10% less than last winter, and below the record high during the 2022-2023 winter. Little comfort to customers struggling to afford rising bills and to their advocates, many of whom blame Rhode Island Energy for profiting in the face of residents’ financial struggles. 
A winter of discontent? Ratepayers, advocates urge regulators to reject proposed utility hikes

A 206-signature petition submitted to utility regulators earlier this month stressed the contrast between residents “pushed to the brink by unaffordable rates” and the utility supplier’s profits reaching “new highs.” 
PPL Corp, the parent company for Rhode Island Energy, which reported a $183 million profit for the three-month period that ended June 30, including an $8 million quarterly profit specific to its operations in Rhode Island. 
But the Pennsylvania-based corporation’s balance sheet received no boost from the prices it charges for electricity usage in Rhode Island. State law prevents the state utility supplier from boosting its bottom line through usage costs, which must directly reflect the price from third-party suppliers — a point explained in detail by Ron Gerwatowski, commission chairman, during the meeting Thursday. And, state regulators cannot reject proposed seasonal rate increases as long as there is no evidence of extra profits for the company.
“We don’t have the authority to deny the cost recovery because costs are straining affordability,” Gerwatowski said.
He later concluded, “I think the decision is really simple for us. Did they comply with the procurement plan and did they do the rates correctly?”

Finding balance
Less simple is how to soothe the pocketbook pain that will come from the newly approved seasonal electric prices. Rhode Island Energy executives, and later Gov. Dan McKee pitched $154 million in bill credits over the next two winters. The credits, mandated to protect customers from company tax payments tied to its 2022 acquisition of the state utility operations from National Grid, were originally set to be distributed over 40 years. But proponents say concentrating the credits over the first three months of 2026 and 2027 — when customers’ utility bills are highest — would provide more meaningful relief. The discounts, which would slash electric bills $20 to $30 per month while cutting $40 to $50 from monthly gas bills, await final approval from the commission.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue will result in a $45 million credit for eligible customers, according to McKee’s office.
McKee has also asked the commission to come with a scheme to yield another $25 million in discounts by adjusting some of the non-supply-side charges. Even before McKee’s public plea, utility regulators indicated they were open to some tweaks to minimize the “rate shock” that occurs each winter when supply prices rise. A July 21 notice sought public feedback on ways to reduce bill costs during “peak heating months.” The solicitation suggested condensing service charges that fund the company’s investments in energy efficiency,  storm recovery work and renewable energy into an eight-month period — excluding December to March — rather than the existing, 12 months. This would reduce customers’ bills during the period when prices are highest.  
In Massachusetts, state utility regulators and Gov. Maura Healey opted for similar workarounds, including cutting charges on energy efficiency programs to save $500 million for ratepayers. 
Environmental advocates criticized Healey’s decision as short-sighted, risking higher costs in the long-term as climate change worsens and natural gas becomes more unreliable and expensive. Rhode Island environmental and consumer protection groups were skeptical, too, of implementing similar tactics in the Ocean State.
“Rate and bill volatility are increasingly tied to the region’s overdependence upon natural gas for power generation, especially in the winter,” Tina Munter, a policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, wrote in an Aug. 6 letter to the commission. “Overdependence upon natural gas is a fact that can and must be addressed by a long-term, steady commitment to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and demand response.”
Jennifer Wood, executive director at the Rhode Island Center for Justice,  attorney representing the George Wiley Center,  strongly recommended in a separate letter against letting Rhode Island Energy tack on deferral fees to make up for temporarily suspended charges. 
Noting that customers rack up debt for unpaid bills in the winter, Margaret Hogan, legal services administrator for Division of Public Utilities and Carriers — the administrative arm of the state utility agency — expressed concern that shifting costs to the summer would “further exacerbate already difficult collections.”
State utility regulators have not made a decision on which, if any of these approaches to take, awaiting more data from Rhode Island Energy. 
Pandemic debt repayment to end
Debt from unpaid bills is a problem for Rhode Island Energy’s balance sheets — rising more than twofold to $254.9 million as of May 2025, according to written filings submitted by the company — prompting the company to push to suspend a pandemic-era requirement that gave customers more time to pay overdue bills with lower upfront payments. In a separate, unanimous vote Thursday, utility regulators agreed Thursday to the proposal to end its March 2020 order — though not as early as Rhode Island Energy wanted.
The flexible COVID-era debt repayment option will end on Jan. 1, rather than the Dec. 1 expiration the company proposed. The vote mandates that Rhode Island Energy work with the 5,000 customers on the existing pandemic repayment plans to transition to other, permanent repayment options rather than risking shutoff.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, said in an emailed response Friday that the company was “committed to delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy.”
“We recognize that affordability is a significant concern and offer various programs and services to help customers save energy, manage their bills, and access financial assistance,” Dalo said.
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates, which take effect Nov. 1, have not been announced. About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

,DC,2025-09-26 18:59:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here's a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-government-shutdown-nearing-heres-guide-what-expect,,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they're not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that's going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it's going to matter a lot to them. It's going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that's not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.“It's really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. What role does Congress have during a shutdown?The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn't expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” “Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”",,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).After a week of heated exchanges between the leaders of Boeing Defense in St. Louis and the union representing its machinists, the two sides have agreed to resume negotiations Monday.
“The bargaining committees for Boeing and IAM 837 have agreed to return to negotiations on Monday with the help of a federal mediator in an effort to find a path to end the strike,” said Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 in a joint statement Friday afternoon. 
The strike by more than 3,200 union members at Boeing Defense facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Illinois, reached 53 days on Friday. 
The union announced Friday morning it was aiming to ramp up support with a rally on Wednesday, as well as a meeting “soon” with union members and Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
Last week, workers voted to approve a union-proposed contract, after overwhelmingly rejecting Boeing’s previous two settlement offers.
The union’s four-year contract proposal includes a $10,000 ratification bonus instead of the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns of pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits, union leaders said.  
The union’s lead negotiator said the “ball’s in their court,” during a press conference Tuesday on Zoom.
“This union is prepared,” said Jody Bennett, IAM Union resident general vice president, said at a press briefing. “If they want to fly in tonight, I’ll stay up all night. We’ll work on weekends, but we’re here to get something that’s fair and equitable.”
Boeing fired back that their position hadn’t changed from the previous week, after they called the workers’ vote on the union’s proposed offer a “publicity stunt” and a “waste of time.” 
“It’s unfortunate the union led its members to vote on an offer that we didn’t extend or collectively bargain,” said Boeing in a statement Tuesday. 
The company accused Bennett of having “selective memory” on Boeing’s offers, pointing to his statement days before members voted down the company’s original offer in July that the agreement “meets the moment.” 
“We agree with him and remain open to constructive talks within the boundaries of our landmark offer for Midwest manufacturing,” according to the company’s Tuesday statement. 
The union’s proposed ratification bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, said Jonathan Battaglia, spokesman for the IAM Union. However, the 401(k) benefits are the same as those Seattle workers received, he said. 
The Northwest strike lasted 53 days, and the company ultimately conceded on some of the workers’ main requests. 
However, Dan Gillian, Boeing St. Louis vice president of air dominance, said in a statement last week that a contract in St. Louis has to “make sense in the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest.”
Missouri Democratic Congressmen Wesley Bell of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, along with members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, urged Boeing last week to return to the bargaining table. 
Soon after the joint statement was released Friday, Boeing posted a “mythbuster” video of Gillian talking about the wage growth in the company’s offer being “very real.”
During the press conference Tuesday, Bennett said Boeing has repeatedly expressed the company won’t veer from the parameters of its core offer, calling it a “sound offer.”
“However, our members are telling us that’s not the case,” Bennett said. “So we will meet Boeing, but without parameters. You know, the strike’s been going on now seven weeks. We may have to look at this as it’s a brand new negotiation. I would hope not.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 14:57:15.852469

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa state parks and state forests will host volunteers Saturday for clean up and maintenance projects in celebration of National Public Lands Day. 
Andy Bartlett, the manager at Ledges State Park near Madrid, said the volunteer events are a way to celebrate public lands in the state, and they help with park maintenance.
Volunteer projects are different at each participating park. Ledges, for example, will lead volunteers to areas of the park that have been taken over by invasive species such as honeysuckle or autumn olive. Volunteers will be given equipment and taught how to remove the plants that would otherwise choke out native species.

Bartlett said Ledges has hosted similar volunteer projects and said each time volunteers are able to see the “immediate impact” of their efforts in the park. 
“By the time we’re done with the project, you have this whole different view of the forest, or the forest edge where we’ve been clearing,” Bartlett said. “It’s kind of satisfying for them to be able to see progress in their work and results immediately with one event.” 
Bartlett said he’s hopeful the Saturday event at Ledges, which begins at 10 a.m. in the Lost Lake Trail parking lot, will draw a crowd of around 50 volunteers. Bartlett said the event is also a “cash in, trash out” or CITO event that allows folks involved in geocaching to earn a virtual souvenir for attending the event. 

Public land owned by the state and managed by Iowa DNR accounts for approximately 1% of Iowa’s 36 million acres. This land comprises the state parks, forests, preserves, recreation areas and lakes that are open to public use. 

While volunteers will be using loppers and other tools to cut down the woody shrubs, Bartlett said there are jobs at the volunteer events in which the whole family can participate. 
Prairie Rose State Park, Lake Darling State Park and Lake MacBride State Park will also host volunteer events geared toward removing invasive species. 
Other parks are asking volunteers to help refurbish picnic tables, pick up trash and debris and assist with other infrastructure maintenance projects. Volunteers at Yellow River State Forest will help to prepare firewood for the forest’s fundraiser firewood sales.  
Bartlett said even one day of volunteer work can help parks check off the projects they haven’t been able to complete on their own. “Any help all of us as managers can get at our areas through volunteers is truly appreciated,” he said.
Specific information on time and meeting location can be found at the state park websites, or on Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ statewide volunteer day page. 
National Public Lands Day has been celebrated on the fourth Saturday of September since 1994. National Parks offer free admission on the day and like Iowa, coordinate dozens of volunteer projects. 
According to the National Park Service, the holiday is a chance for citizens to assemble with a common goal of “stewarding America’s natural resources for future generations to enjoy.” 
Bartlett said the day helps volunteers feel connected to their public lands. Sometimes, he said that means they even get involved with other volunteer events or groups that help take care of the parks. 
“Eventually, we’re creating stewards that not only give back to our park through volunteer labor, but they’re advocates for our park as well,” Bartlett said.

The flight back to Jackson that night in June 2023 was full. I was then serving as an interim pastor in the city after a lifetime away.
I had already boarded the plane and was settled into my seat when a young Black man in sports coat and tie carrying a huge trophy over his head came down the aisle. The trophy was at least four feet tall. About the time he got to my row, a middle-aged white man wearing a cord coat turned around and took the trophy and placed it in an overhead bin. They looked like student and teacher. Or maybe debater and coach. I had been on the debate team in high school and college. It had been a long time ago. But the wardrobe looked the same. 
He took his seat opposite mine on the aisle. Due to plane noise on the small jet and a chatty neighbor next to him, I didn’t have a chance to speak to him until we landed and were standing in the aisle ready to deplane.  
“Nice trophy.”
He won it that morning at a national debate tournament in Phoenix. He was beaming. He should be. I asked where he went to school. He said Jackson Prep. Wow. 
I was part of the Jackson Prep class of 1973. I never went to a national debate tournament. No one from Prep did back then. In college I had teammates who did. But I never went.  There were no Black students at Prep in my days there. The only Black people on campus then were the maintenance and custodial staff. 
Through the years my mother and I talked about changes that happened in Mississippi and the world. She would often end the conversation by saying: “But look how far we have come.” 
My parents were always concerned that I get a “good education.” It was a mantra for them. I think they meant they wanted my brother and me to develop critical thinking and communication skills. But it was otherwise undefined. 
When I was a public Bailey Junior High School seventh grader in 1967, I assumed I’d eventually be at Jackson’s flagship Murrah High School. A Murrah Mustang.

My parents took me and my brother to Murrah football games. They had awesome teams in the late 1960s. A neighbor played for the Mustangs and went on to Georgia Tech to play, or so I was told. I attended the student musicals at Murrah. My parents were friends with the principal and his wife. We had cookouts at each other’s homes along with other friends from church. That was the way it was supposed to be. But it did not last.
Things changed in the 1969-1970 school year. I’m not sure when I first learned about Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court case that ruled “separate but equal” for schools was unconstitutional. There was another case, Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, decided in 1969 that ordered no further community stonewalling. But it was a long time before I knew the name of that case. While it charted my path away from public Murrah High School to private all-white Jackson Prep, it was not a foreordained path. 
Talk about “good education” was everywhere in my white world. I recall my parents sharing their concern with me. They and their friends were concerned that the “new” teachers would not have the necessary skills and attributes to provide the “good education” they wanted for my brother and me. But most of these “new” teachers came from “other” schools. Schools where the students were Black. The teachers were as well. 
As a ninth grader at Bailey, I did not know about these court cases. I heard my parents and other adults talk about the “Court” but did not know specifics. The talk was that schools would be closed after Christmas break (never “winter break” in those days) for three weeks while some plan was drawn up for school attendance in the spring of 1970 and into the next year. There was even a chance I would not finish the year at Bailey. But I did. 
But the high school arrangement would be different. Murrah was paired with Brinkley High School, one of the all-Black high schools in the Jackson Public Schools. On the street where I lived, we said there were five high schools: Murrah, Central, Provine, Wingfield and Callaway. Those were the historically white ones. We didn’t count the “others.” Didn’t compete against them. Didn’t know anyone who went to them. Couldn’t have gotten to them by ourselves. Didn’t know the names of these schools.  So they did not exist in our little bubble of the world. 
But they did exist. Brinkley, Jim Hill and Lanier, schools created for the purpose of segregating Black students, all existed. There were real students who attended, real teachers who taught, real parents concerned about their children’s “good education.” 
I know that growing up my parents taught me the importance of respecting individuals for who and what they were. My father made a medical mission trip to the Eku Hospital in Nigeria in 1968 during the civil war there. My mother was deeply involved in the Women’s Missionary Union at Woodland Hills Baptist Church. They received and entertained missionaries from around the world. It was always understood that racial epithets, slurs and characterizations were not accepted in our home. 
But one evening a group of their church friends came over. A comedian/evangelist had recently spoken at church and sold copies of his LP album: Laughin’ With ‘Em. There was a second album too. My parents bought them. After dinner the guests gathered around the new Fischer stereo console and played the albums. The comedian spoke in dialect. The punch line of each yarn made fun of the Black folk in each story. Just like Amos N’ Andy. Everyone in the room laughed. I was listening from the hallway. No doubt I laughed, too. This form of racism was in the air we breathed and the water we drank on my street in the “Closed Society.” 
My parents were “good people” and respected “all” people. But not accepting that a teacher was capable of providing a “good education” to me or my brother because that teacher was Black was racism. It still is. 
The search for a “good education” took me afield from Mississippi. My parents did not want to give in to the private school bonanza that spread like wildfire in 1970. My mother stopped us from visiting her brother and his family in the early 1960s. She was disturbed by the racist reading material from the John Birch Society that she found everywhere at their house. But they were not prepared in any way for the tidal wave of change that broke in the wake of the Alexander v. Holmes decision. Good intentions and family disagreements take on a different meaning in the eye of a hurricane landmark court case.
Together we found the Darlington School for Boys in Rome, Georgia, where I attended 10th grade as a boarding student. Isn’t it ironic that to avoid going to a segregation academy, I chose to go to an all-white school almost 400 miles away from home?
There were a number of boys from Mississippi whom I met that year. I don’t recall talking about why we were there, though I am sure we did. And I would hazard a guess that it would revolve around “good education.” Of course. There were no Black students at Darlington that year. Irony abounds.
Once I went to the hallway bathroom eager to relieve myself. Standing at the urinal, I looked down on a photo of Martin Luther King Jr. I just left it there. I knew this racist act was wrong. But I lacked the courage to remove it. And I knew the Black custodian could be counted on to clean it up.
Most of my psychic energy during 10th grade at Darlington was used to figure out how to return “home.” Would I attend Murrah as I had always planned? Another option presented itself: Jackson Prep had emerged from the primal slough of the segregation academies. Or at least that’s what those in prosperous, professional northeast Jackson told itself. The rationale was that this school would be different from an academy. A couple of founders were world renowned physicians on the University of Mississippi medical school faculty. This certainly impressed my father and mother. And me as well.
Many prominent businesspeople and professionals had organized the school. As I recall, each student family purchased “stock” which provided capital for the school. On top of that, tuition was paid for each student. As if to emphasize the distinction, the name of Prep did not include “academy.” It was as if the organizers were trying to create distance between Prep and the reality of the time.
“People” said that Jackson needed a “real” option that was a “college preparatory school.” And Jackson Prep was meant to deliver that. I believed it. At least, I wanted to believe it. 
But somehow it rang hollow. There was a gathering of student leaders from around Jackson at the Mississippi Fairgrounds my senior year. Public and private schools sent groups. Another Prep student made a speech that attempted to demonstrate that students, regardless of the school attended, had more similarities than differences. I was moved by his persuasiveness. But his argument was empty rhetoric.
The exodus to private schools I was part of had been prompted by fear of the “other.” The eloquent oratory of a classmate could not stave off the trauma we all were living with. That we all continue to live with.
Many of the “best” faculty from Murrah moved to Prep. The English and drama teacher I had in 11th and 12th grade was one of them. The football coach and most of the white players came to Prep. There was a sense that Prep was a continuation of pre-integration Murrah. I don’t recall talking about the why’s or how’s of that happening. It just was. 
I was glad to be back “home.” There were many students who would have been my classmates at Murrah had we not opted out. Did we talk about this obvious fact? I don’t remember if we did. But I do remember driving by Murrah often as it was on the way to my grandmother’s apartment in Belhaven. The question of what had happened hung in the air. Unspoken. But very real.
When I look back, I see how careful and intentional a lot of our silences were. We Prep transplants wanted to believe we were a cut above academy “rednecks.” In our DNA, though, Prep was as white and as new as the other estimated four thousand white-flight private schools that popped up in the South at the time of integration.
I joined the debate team and participated in dramatic productions; signed up for the Key Club; found a group who played the board game Risk; went to most football games; had my first rum and coke. I wanted to think of myself as an “academic.” Actually, I was a pseudo-intellectual. Or maybe, I was just an awkward teenage boy in a shifting white world. 
All of our parents were middle and upper class. I don’t know what the “stock” buy-in was, nor the amount of tuition, but the costs were considerable. I knew the cost kept some from attending. I heard somewhere that maybe, one day, there would be a Black student at Prep. Maybe. One day. When a Black student had the potential to be a star athlete or win a national debate tournament was found. Then.
There was something Prep offered that Murrah could not. Murrah drew from a set city attendance zone. As a private school, Prep took in white students from beyond northeast Jackson and even outlying towns. The sectional divisions of north, south and west Jackson were quite real. Even among the white population, there was economic and class messaging for each section. In more recent years, a couple of my non-north Jackson classmates told me how awkward they felt due to the weight of class and Jackson social strata. But all of us were white.  
My journey took me to college in Alabama before returning to Ole Miss for grad school. I don’t know when, or even if, I decided I’d become a Mississippi ex-pat. It just happened. There was an invitation to enroll in an Auburn Ph.D. program, a job in North Carolina and then seminary in Kentucky.
I honed an interest in church history, especially how what is said correlates with what is actually done. Unsurprisingly, I suppose, that’s what I’m examining in my own school history here. That focus also led to my book, Religion & Race: Southern Presbyterians 1946-1983 and some published articles on religion, race and faith. 
Along the way my father retired. My parents moved to North Carolina. I found my way back to North Carolina and then to Georgia, where I’ve resided longer than I lived in Mississippi. Yet it is Mississippi, not Georgia, that has always been on my mind.
I wondered if there was a “call” for me to serve as a pastor in Mississippi. There were some conversations and interviews when our sons were school age. No offers were made. Even so the topic my wife and I often turned to in those times was how to provide our children with a “good education.” 
As it happens, I did return to Jackson for a season. I served as the interim pastor of Fondren Presbyterian Church for 18 months. So much had changed. There I found white folk who had stood firm for public schools back in that day. They seem to have found the “good education” my parents sought.
As my mother would say: “Look how far we have come.” 
I would respond: “And look how far we have to go.”

So said New Mexico health officials on Friday, noting in a news release that the state logged its last case on Aug. 14 in Santa Fe County, meaning more than 42 days have passed without new cases, “a timeframe that represents twice the virus’s maximum incubation period.”
3 new measles cases pushes New Mexico’s total count of infections to 100

NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM the end of the outbreak means the risk of measles spread inside New Mexico is lower. However, “We do still have outbreaks ongoing in states surrounding us, so we will remain vigilant for folks in our state traveling to those areas or folks from those areas traveling to us and will work to detect any imported cases,” he said.
Smelser said vaccine recommendations remain the same: Two doses of the measles vaccine will be the most protective for most people.
New Mexico reported its first measles case on Feb. 11, a Lea County teenager, whose case followed an outbreak in the neighboring Gaines County in Texas. The state subsequently declared an outbreak three days later when two adults in the same county tested positive, meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threshold for constituting an outbreak.
In total, New Mexico’s 100 cases spread across nine counties, with one reported death. Of the cases, 53 were among people 18 years and older; 24 were among people 4-years-old and younger and 23 were among people ages 5 to 17. More than half the cases —57 — were among unvaccinated people. It was the largest outbreak of measles in New Mexico in the past four decades.
Since Feb. 1, more than 56,000 people have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, NMDOH says, which remains “widely available” in the state.
The number of people seeking a vaccine during the outbreak was 61% higher than the number of people who received shots over the same time last year, which Smelser credited for keeping the rate of spread low.
“Folks who came in and got themselves up to date really helped us stop this from getting even worse,” Smelser said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee National Guard troops will be deputized as part of an “accelerated” crime-fighting effort set to start next week in Memphis but will not make arrests or carry weapons unless requested by police, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday.
“Information from the police department … on what support they need will determine and drive whether or not a particular National Guardsman is armed,” he said. 
The governor announced the state will direct $100 million toward a state, federal and local partnership to crack down on crime. Some 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be assigned to the city along with an undetermined number of Guard personnel and more than a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The anti-crime task force will operate “as long as it takes” to make Memphians feel safe to go to a Grizzlies basketball game at the FedEx Forum or Beale Street without fear of being a victim of crime, the governor said.
Even though Lee told reporters a month ago that National Guard deployment wasn’t being considered, he said planning for the operation with Mayor Paul Young and the Trump administration has been taking place for months. 










I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city. 


– Memphis Mayor Paul Young 


National Guard troops are to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, which will oversee the operation, and will play a support role as a “force multiplier,” Lee said. He did not detail the tasks they would take up.
“Never before has a city in the country had access to these resources,” Lee said.
The crime-fighting effort is necessary, he said, to boost economic recruitment and to give relief to residents such as a mother who described to him the loss of her son to street violence.
The governor didn’t declare a state of emergency activating the National Guard but authorized the deployment at the request of the federal government. President Donald Trump recently signed a memorandum directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to approve the plan and use of Guard troops.
Asked about the potential for friction between troops and neighborhood residents, Lee said people will understand the support role troops will play when they see them “on the ground.” 
Young said he wants to sustain gains made in cutting crime such as a 13% reduction in overall crime in 2024, a 19% cut in violent crime and 29% reduction in murders, followed by similar figures in 2025.

“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the department has been asking for more federal help for several years and added that she wants to make sure “Memphians know the work being done is on their behalf.”
State lawmakers who represent inner-city Memphis have criticized the plan to deploy National Guard troops there.
Talks with FBI Director Kash Patel started this spring, and initially the FBI was to lead the effort in Memphis.
“It was never off the table that the National Guard would be used. But it wasn’t the plan at the time … that this would develop,” Lee said.
As talks unfolded with the Trump administration, the option for federal funding to bring in the National Guard and federal agencies to back local law enforcement made it “evident” that the plan should be put into place, Lee said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida law now requires educators to self-report to their employers within 48 hours an arrest for a felony or certain misdemeanors.
The list of offenses ranges from sexual misconduct with mental health patients, felony fraud, murder, aggravated assault, human trafficking, weapons on school grounds, prostitution, felony voyeurism, threats to kill, and more.
Educators also now have to self-report to their schools convictions, commitments to pretrial diversion programs, or findings of guilt for “any criminal offense other than a minor traffic violation within 48 hours after the final judgement.”
The change is a result of SB 1374, passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year. This week, the Florida Board of Education approved inserting language from that law in the Principles of Professional Conduct for the Education Profession in Florida. 
Previously, teachers were required to self-report within 48 hours arrests or charges related only to the abuse of a child or sale or possession of controlled substances. 
The law requires school boards to develop a policy for temporarily removing teachers from classrooms within 24 hours of notification of a felony or certain misdemeanor offenses. 
Violation of the principles of professional conduct for teachers is ground for suspension or revocation of a teaching license.
The measure passed the Senate and the House unanimously, although some lawmakers raised concerns about how the measure could compromise due process. 
Sen. Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville, sponsored the Senate version and Rep. Will Robinson, R-Bradenton, sponsored the House version.
The law acknowledges that teachers notifying of an arrest is not an admission of guilt.

A growing number of Americans believe that gender-affirming care will become less accessible in their lifetime, a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll finds — reflecting a political landscape that has become increasingly hostile toward transgender health care.
Nearly 4 in 10 Americans think gender-affirming care will become less accessible over the course of their lifetime. A year ago, The 19th and SurveyMonkey found only 20 percent of Americans felt that way. But since President Donald Trump returned to office, the federal government has subpoenaed doctors for trans patients’ private data and pressured hospitals in blue states to close their clinics that provided gender-affirming care to minors. The administration has pledged to investigate the care as medical fraud, despite the medical community’s broad endorsement of gender-affirming care as an effective treatment for gender dysphoria, which is persistent distress felt when one’s body is out of sync with their identity.
Thirty-one percent of Americans believe gender-affirming care will become more accessible in their lifetime, down from 48 percent in 2024. Women are generally more likely than men to think access will expand —  except for Gen Z.
The SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, provides a detailed window into what Americans believe about trans health care, after conservative groups have poured millions of dollars into anti-trans campaign ads. The survey had a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.

A majority of Americans (53 percent) believe transgender adults should have access to gender-affirming care, while 37 percent believe that trans minors should have that same access. But they’re divided on whether politicians should intervene: Half of Americans oppose lawmakers banning or restricting care for transgender youth.
Many Americans across the political spectrum would prefer that politicians avoid focusing on trans issues at all. Four in ten Americans — with an even split between Democrats and Republicans — think politicians should not focus on transgender issues. This alignment marks a notable difference from 2024, when 33 percent of Democrats agreed with this hands-off stance compared with 53 percent of Republicans.
The past year has seen significant hand-wringing within the Democratic Party on trans rights. Some have argued that Democrats let Republicans dominate the public’s perception of trans people during the 2024 election — and lost voters in the process.
The share of Republicans who believe politicians should focus on restricting gender-affirming care has risen since last year (49 percent versus 35 percent), while the share of Democrats who believe politicians should focus on protecting transgender people has dipped (52 percent versus 58 percent).
Among parents, only 31 percent of those with kids under 18 support gender-affirming care access for trans youth — compared with 47 percent of non-parents. Overall, mothers are more likely than fathers to be in favor of such care. LGBTQ+ parents are also more likely to be supportive of trans youth accessing the health care.
Trans minors and trans adults go through very different processes to receive gender-affirming care. Young kids socially transition, meaning they change their outward appearance to match their gender expression by getting a haircut or wearing masculine or feminine clothes. If they feel affirmed through that social transition, further options for care include puberty blockers or, for adolescents, hormone replacement therapy. Both of these options alleviate gender dysphoria and require ongoing doctor’s appointments to monitor treatment, as well as parental consent. The majority of trans youth do not undergo surgery.
The survey also indicates that one dynamic may be shifting, at least among Republicans. Past polling, including from The 19th and SurveyMonkey, showed that people who know trans people are less likely to oppose access to gender-affirming care. While this year’s data shows that is true for Democrats, among Republicans, knowing a trans person made no difference when it came to care for minors and a small one when it came to care for adults. Still, 48 percent of Republicans who know a trans person strongly oppose access to gender-affirming care for adults, versus 56 percent who do not know a trans person.
LGBTQ+ advocates have long relied on sharing the personal stories of transgender people as a tool to push for protective policies and to oppose discriminatory ones. But as conservative media outlets and politicians have amplified more misinformation about trans people and their health care, that strategy may not be as effective as it has been in the past.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19th-Poll-2025-Gender-Care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 13:57:22.176588

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas PBS Commission approved a $206,000 salary Friday for Rep. Carlton Wing as the agency’s new CEO and executive director starting Sept. 29. 
The commission nominated the North Little Rock Republican and House Speaker Pro Tempore to replace Courtney Pledger, who resigned in April after leading the public television network for eight years. If confirmed, Wing would be required to resign from the Arkansas Legislature, triggering a special election to finish his term through 2027. Wing announced in June that he would not run for reelection to a sixth term next year.
Commission Vice Chairman Woody Freeman told commissioners at Friday’s special-call meeting that the state allows a salary range of $155,000 to $211,000 for the executive director position. Arkansas PBS budgeted $211,000 for the role, and Freeman said he recommended $206,000 because of Wing’s “business background, his extensive media background and he’s a highly respected legislator.”
Wing is serving his fifth term in the House and is a former sports broadcaster for Little Rock’s KARK. He also co-founded the video production company Wing Media Group with his wife. 
Asked by commissioners about the proposed salary, Freeman said it was the lowest compared to neighboring states. Sanji Kumpuris, who has served as interim director, said Pledger’s salary was more than $190,000, though she couldn’t recall the exact amount. Kumpuris also noted Wing would not be eligible for a merit increase next June because he was hired after the July 1 deadline to be eligible for this cycle. 
Arkansas lawmakers approved merit pay raises for nearly 500 state employees in June 2024, including Pledger whose annual salary was expected to increase from $179,999.87 to $190,961.86, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. 
The Arkansas PBS Commission approved Wing’s proposed salary and a motion by Gary Newton to have Wing work with the governor to ensure the interim title was bestowed to Kumpuris and that she be retroactively paid at the agreed upon rate for the time she served in the position. Newton asked that Wing report back to the commission on these tasks at its next meeting.

(Screenshot/Office of the Special Counsel YouTube channel)Former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman’s license to practice law in Wisconsin has been suspended for three years after a third-party referee agreed with the state Office of Lawyer Regulation’s allegations that he violated standards for professional conduct during his much-maligned review of the 2020 presidential election. 
The suspension marks the conclusion of Gableman’s effort to fight attempts to hold him accountable for his conduct during the election investigation. The OLR found that while working on behalf of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos to look into alleged wrongdoing during the election, Gableman lied to a Waukesha County judge about conversations he had with other attorneys, lied to an Assembly committee, deliberately violated state open records laws, used his agreement with Vos to pursue his own political interests, violated his duty of confidentiality to his client and lied in an affidavit to the OLR as it was investigating him. 
Gableman’s investigation ultimately cost the state more than $2.3 million without finding any evidence to confirm President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of fraud during the 2020 election. 
The review also helped further fan the flames of election conspiracy theories in the state. Those beliefs have remained prominent among segments of the state Republican Party’s base nearly five years after the election. 
After fighting the allegations against him, Gableman ultimately reached an agreement with the OLR and stipulated that the allegations in the complaint against him were true. 
In his report the referee, James Winiarski, wrote that the consequences for Gableman’s actions must be severe. 
“A high level of discipline is needed to protect the public, the courts and the legal system from repetition of Attorney Gableman’s misconduct by Attorney Gableman or any other attorneys,” Winiarski wrote. “His misconduct was very public in nature and involved many members of the public and employees of several municipalities.”

Former Liquor Commission […]","Federal courthouse in downtown Lincoln. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The former director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and a co-owner of two Lincoln strip clubs both pleaded not guilty this week in a public corruption case alleging the director took money, lap dances and sexual favors at the clubs while working for the state board overseeing liquor licenses.
Former Liquor Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe faces seven felony charges, three counts of honest services fraud, a charge that a public official or employee deprived the people of their honest work or services, one count of conspiring to commit honest services fraud, two counts of wire fraud and a single count of extortion.
One of his alleged co-conspirators, Brent Zywiec, a part owner of Lincoln strip club The Office and a former co-owner of The Night Before Lounge, faces four felony charges, three counts of honest services fraud and one count of conspiring to commit such fraud. Each of the charges against both men could lead to prison sentences of up to 20 years. 
Both men joined their first federal court hearings in Lincoln by video conference from jails in Saunders and Saline Counties, and both successfully fought federal prosecutors’ efforts to detain them through trial. 
Ex-Nebraska Liquor Commission director charged with taking cash, sexual favors in strip club probe

U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline DeLuca released both after ruling in hearings on Thursday that the federal government had failed to make a compelling argument to hold them. 
Prosecutors had argued that Rupe was at risk of harming himself or obstructing the investigation, basing it on comments he had made after search warrants were served and after investigators alleged that he had shared information about police investigations of a competing Omaha strip club with the club co-owner. 
In a longer hearing, they argued Zywiec was a risk to influence or intimidate witnesses because of his alleged ties to the motorcycle gang Hell’s Angels, basing it on witness interviews with people who said they worried about speaking out against him.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Mruz based most of her arguments for continued detention on testimony from FBI Special Agent Alex Cross, who said either man might discuss the case with others and put witness statements or other information crucial to proving the case at risk. He pointed to efforts between them to share that they were being investigated and to shift communications from cellphones that could be wiretapped to a more secure encrypted app.
But the attorney for Rupe, Bill McGinn, and the attorney for Zywiec, Carlos Monzón, argued that their clients had already shown they were not risks. Monzón also argued that the government had offered no evidence that his client had attempted to contact, persuade or threaten anyone related to the case. 
The judge seemed to agree, letting both men go free Thursday night.
McGinn did not immediately return messages seeking comment about the case. Monzón, reached Friday, said his client is “totally innocent” and called the case an example of “government overreach.”
“I find it almost offensive that here is an individual that is helping law enforcement, and they’re claiming that he is trying to harm a competitor that is 50 or 60 miles away from his business,” Monzón said. “It makes no sense.”
U.S. Attorney Lesley Woods, in a statement Thursday and in a press conference earlier this week, argued that “public corruption undermines” public trust in public officials.
The federal indictment unsealed this week alleges that Rupe, who had served nearly a decade as an assistant Nebraska attorney general, accepted payments and services from the clubs from 2022-2025.
Among the gifts offered and accepted, it said, were free entry into bars that usually charge $20 cover fees, free drinks and cash to cover free lap dances, VIP dances and additional services that included oral sex.
Federal authorities say at least one surveillance video that investigators secured showed Rupe receiving sexual favors. Some videos of people in compromising positions were saved to the owner’s iCloud account, the indictment says. Rupe is also accused of looking the other way when he should have seen or known that potential liquor license violations were occurring.
“The citizens of Nebraska are the primary victims of this case,” Woods said. “The Executive Director of the Liquor Control Commission should be the official who polices establishments like the ones identified in the indictment for the benefit of public safety.”

All three names have been floated as possible replacements for Frank White Jr. if he is recalled next week. (Provided photos via KC Beacon)As voters cast ballots in the special Tuesday election to recall Jackson County Executive Frank White Jr., a question that’s rarely been openly discussed lingers.
If White is removed from office, who will be selected to replace him?
The Jackson County Legislature would be tasked with nominating and voting to confirm his replacement to serve out the rest of his term. That person would steer the county government for the next 14 months. If they choose to run for reelection in 2026, they would have a leg up as the incumbent to hold on to that position as long as they keep running.
It’s an important question. And it’s one that several elected members of the county Legislature are hoping that voters will ignore — at least for now.
Legislator Sean Smith, a Republican who represents southeastern Jackson County, wants voters to remain focused on White’s performance as the county executive.
“The vote is only about one thing. Is Frank doing a good enough job that he should stay in office?” Smith said.
Smith said it would also be disrespectful to White to name his replacement before he’s even been removed from office. He compared it to introducing someone to their replacement before they’ve even been fired.
“We’re not supposed to select somebody and then have them have a competition (against White),” Smith said. “We as legislators shouldn’t be manipulating the vote.”
White disagrees. He has called for the legislators to be more transparent about their intentions.
“I must speak plainly: what troubles me most is the Legislature’s refusal to answer the most basic question — if a vacancy were to occur, how will the next County Executive be chosen?” White said in a written statement. “That silence speaks volumes. It suggests there is no interest in a fair and open selection — only in backroom deals and political favors.”
Publicly, the legislators are tight-lipped about whom they might pick.
But behind the scenes, the campaign for the next county executive is already underway.
 The secret race to become county executive

Two candidates have publicly expressed their desire to replace White if he is recalled: Phil LeVota and Dan Tarwater.
LeVota is an attorney who worked in the county prosecutor’s office for a decade.
Tarwater served on the Jackson County Legislature for 28 years before running for Kansas City Council in 2023. He lost to KC Tenants organizer Johnathan Duncan.
County Legislator Manny Abarca IV also has been rumored to be in the running to replace White, but he told The Beacon that he is not seeking the position.
“I have no interest in seeking that role,” he said. “I’m usually looked at as the aggressive one of the bunch, and no one wants to put me in that seat, so I’ll gracefully step back from the opportunity there.”
DaRon McGee, who represents the 4th District and chairs the Legislature, wants voters to trust legislators to make the right decision if the recall is successful and they vote for White’s potential successor. The votes of at least five of nine legislators are needed to approve a replacement for White.
“We elect members of Congress to cast votes on our behalf,” he told The Beacon. “You trust these representatives to represent your best interests. And that’s all I can say. We have to trust the process.”
The Beacon asked McGee if he was willing to share any other candidates he was aware of aside from LeVota and Tarwater, and he responded, “No, not at this time.”
McGee didn’t say he also is a candidate to succeed White.
Abarca confirmed that McGee has joined Tarwater and LeVota as a third candidate to replace White. (This had already been shared with The Beacon by four other people involved in county politics who did not want the information attributed to them.)
Even some of McGee’s colleagues have been kept in the dark as to who is in the running to replace White.
If McGee is a candidate to be county executive, County Legislator Megan Smith said, that has never been communicated with her.
“No names have been presented to the legislature (that I am aware of) as nominees to consider seriously,” she told The Beacon in a text message.
She represents the 3rd At-Large District, which covers the southern third of the county.
 ‘No clearer violation of the ethics standards’

McGee didn’t address the possibility that he could vote for himself as county executive. In theory, though, he said he didn’t believe it would be a conflict of interest for a legislator to vote for themselves.
“We vote for appointments for ourselves all the time,” he said. “So for example, I’m on the Mid-American Regional Council board, I’m on the zoo board, I’m on the Starlight board, representing the Legislature, and I vote for those resolutions for myself.”
The difference is that those board appointments he listed are unpaid. The county executive, in contrast, made nearly $130,000 in 2023 — more than three times the salary of a county legislator.
At least one of McGee’s colleagues in the Legislature said that voting for yourself to succeed White would not only be inappropriate, but also a likely violation of the county’s code of ethics.
“As legislators, we make 36 grand a year, and as county executive, they make 140 or something,” Sean Smith said. “There could be no clearer violation of the ethics standards than to vote for yourself.”
Notably, White faced a similar situation in 2016 when he was nominated to replace former County Executive Mike Sanders.

White was a legislator at the time, representing the 1st At-Large District, and he abstained from the vote to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. He was confirmed by an 8-0 vote by his colleagues on the Legislature.
Chris Crawford, the director of Jackson County’s Ethics, Human Relations & Citizen Complaints Department, would not speculate on a hypothetical scenario in which McGee would cast a vote for himself.
“I definitely can see the justification of why it could be considered a violation,” he said. “But the ethics code does have some ambiguous language in it and interpretation in it as well.”
Abarca said he can also understand the opinion that voting for oneself could be considered a conflict of interest. But he said he has asked the county counselor to provide specific guidance as to whether it would be illegal.
The Beacon spoke with Tarwater and LeVota, who didn’t believe that it was a conflict of interest.
 An alternative method to select White’s replacement

The three main candidates for county executive are working with legislators to recruit the five votes needed to win confirmation.
That’s how the nominating process worked in 2016 when White was voted in to replace Sanders. But it’s not the only option.
In 2011, Jim Kanatzar was named a circuit judge and resigned from his position as Jackson County prosecutor. Sanders, who was county executive at the time, was tasked with naming his replacement.
He could have selected someone on his own. Instead, he created a five-member independent nominating committee, containing no members of the Legislature.
The committee kicked off with a community listening session with members of the public. Tony Miller, an attorney from Lee’s Summit, was one of the five committee members. Miller would later become a county legislator four years later.

At that listening session, he said, they had a blackboard and asked the audience to help brainstorm characteristics they were looking for in a future prosecutor.
The Mid-America Regional Council provided support to the county and helped oversee the entire process.
“Although not legally required, it seems to be the most democratic thing you could do,” Miller said. “To get community input through a nonpartisan outlet such as MARC, to convene something like this and include even members of the academic community … to give a different perspective than just self-interested politicians.”
The committee solicited a large pool of applications, then held public interviews with the top eight candidates.
They narrowed it down to three candidates, who met privately with Sanders for the final interview. Then he appointed Jean Peters Baker, who would be reelected in 2012, 2016 and 2020.
The county used a similar process in 2018, when then-Sheriff Mike Sharp resigned from office, to select Darryl Forte as the interim appointee.
 Could Jackson County do the same thing if White is recalled?

McGee, chair of the Jackson County Legislature, is not interested in following that process. He believes that the county should do what it did in 2016, when White was appointed without a formal application process.
He said that the people who are interested in running are circulating their resumes and talking with legislators, and he doesn’t think it would make a difference to solicit applications.
McGee also doesn’t want to deliberate on the merits of each nominee at a public meeting.
“What I’m going to do is provide a forum or a process that will allow members to nominate someone, and then we will cast a vote,” he said.
Tarwater and LeVota both said that they would be open to having a public interview during the selection process.
Under his preferred process, McGee said, the public won’t get a vote on the county executive, so the candidates only need to make their case to the legislators — not to the general public.
“The reality is, this election (to replace White), if he is recalled, is not an election of the public,” he said. “This is a vote of the Legislature. So the audience is much smaller, and so you’re speaking to nine individuals.”
At least two of the three potential candidates have political baggage that could come up in a public forum that may not come up otherwise.
In 2022, Tarwater made enemies with KC Tenants, the citywide tenant union, when they said he behaved disrespectfully towards tenants at a mobile home village who were displaced by the Jackson County Detention Center.
That grudge led the union’s political arm, KC Tenants Power, to ask Johnathan Duncan to run against him in the Kansas City Council’s 6th District race to prevent him from winning the seat.
Meanwhile, McGee resigned from the Missouri House of Representatives in 2018 amid allegations of sexual harassment.
McGee was accused of pursuing an unwanted relationship with an employee for 10 months. He was then accused of obstructing an ethics committee investigation related to the allegation. The ethics committee ultimately recommended stripping him of his committee assignments, and he resigned before it could come to a vote on the floor.
Sean Smith and Abarca disagree with McGee about how the nominating process should go. Abarca said he wasn’t sure the 2011 process should necessarily be the model, but he believes transparency is critical to restore trust in the county.
Smith told The Beacon that he had been unaware of the 2011 process, but having learned about it, he thought it was an interesting idea to consider.
“For one thing, you’d let people get familiar with someone,” he said. “After people have watched the video, they would have the opportunity to give us feedback. So as a legislator, I’d love that, because they might observe something that I didn’t notice.”

For months, the complaints have rolled in from parts of the country hit by natural disasters: The Federal Emergency Management Agency was moving far too slowly in sending aid to communities ravaged by floods and hurricanes, including in central Texas and North Carolina. Many officials were blaming Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, whose agency oversees FEMA.
“I can’t get phone calls back,” Ted Budd, the Republican senator from North Carolina, told a newspaper this month, describing his attempts to reach Noem’s office. “I can’t get them to initiate the money. It’s just a quagmire.” The delays were caused in part by a new policy announced by DHS that requires Noem’s personal sign-off on expenses over $100,000, several news outlets reported.
But records obtained by ProPublica show how one locality found a way to get FEMA aid more quickly: It asked one of Noem’s political donors for help.
The records show that Noem quickly expedited more than $11 million of federal money to rebuild a historic pier in Naples, Florida, after she was contacted by a major financial supporter last month. The pier is a tourist attraction in the wealthy Gulf Coast enclave and was badly damaged by Hurricane Ian in 2022.
Frustrated city officials had been laboring for months, without success, to get disaster assistance. But just two weeks after the donor stepped in, they were celebrating their sudden change of fortune. “We are now at warp speed with FEMA,” one city official wrote in an email. A FEMA representative wrote: “Per leadership instruction, pushing project immediately.”
Along with fast-tracking the money, Noem flew to Naples on a government plane to tour the pier herself. She then stayed for the weekend and got dinner with the donor, local cardiologist Sinan Gursoy, at the French restaurant Bleu Provence, according to records and an interview with the Naples mayor. This account is based on text messages and emails ProPublica obtained through public records requests.
Noem’s actions in Naples suggest the injection of political favoritism into an agency tasked with saving lives and rebuilding communities wiped out by disaster. It also heightens concerns about the discretion Noem has given herself by personally handling all six-figure expenses at the agency, consolidating her power over who wins and loses in the pursuit of federal relief dollars, experts said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said that politics has long been a factor in federal disaster relief — one study found that swing states are more likely to get federal help, for example. But “I’ve not heard of anything this egregious — a donor calling up and saying I need help and getting it,” he said, “while others may be getting denied assistance or otherwise waiting in line for help that may or may not come.”
In a statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, “This has nothing to do with politics: Secretary Noem also visited Ruidoso, NM” — where floods killed three people in July — “at the request of a Democrat governor and has been integral in supporting and speeding up their recovery efforts.”
“Your criticizing the Secretary’s visit to the Pier is bizarre as she works to fix this issue for more than 1 million visitors that used to visit the pier,” McLaughlin added. She did not answer questions about the donor’s role in expediting the funding or Noem’s relationship with him. Reached by phone, Gursoy said “get lost” and hung up. He did not respond to detailed follow up questions.

Noem has been criticized for creating a bottleneck at FEMA. When the floods hit Texas this summer — ultimately killing over 100 people — it took days to deploy critical search-and-rescue teams because Noem hadn’t signed off on them, according to CNN. Budd, the Republican senator, said this month: “Pretty much everything Helene-related is over $100,000. So they’re stacking up on her desk waiting for her signature.”
Noem has denied there were delays in the Texas flood response and has defended her expense policy, saying it has saved billions of dollars. “Every day I get up and I think, the American people are paying for this, should they?” she recently said. “And are these dollars doing what the law says they should be doing? I’m going to make sure that they go there.”
Once a sleepy fishing town, Naples is now home to CEOs and billionaires (a property listed for $295 million recently made headlines as the most expensive home in the U.S.). The city is known as an important stop for Republican politicians raising money, and Noem has held multiple fundraisers in the area. State credit card records suggest she visited Naples at least 10 times during her last four years as South Dakota governor.
Noem’s top adviser, Corey Lewandowski, also appears to own a home in Naples near the city’s pier, according to property tax records. Lewandowski is an unpaid staffer at DHS serving as Noem’s de facto chief of staff. (Media reports have alleged the two are romantically involved, which they have both denied.) Lewandowski told ProPublica that he was not involved in the pier decision and that he was not in Naples during Noem’s visit.


Let us know what you think...


 

For the first seven months of the Trump administration, the pier reconstruction was in bureaucratic purgatory. The city had long been struggling to secure the regulatory approvals it needed to start building, and emails suggest Trump’s wave of federal layoffs had made the process even slower. “These agencies are undergoing significant reorganizations and staff reductions,” a city official told a frustrated constituent in early August. That “sometimes means starting over with new reviewers — something we’ve faced more than once.”
McLaughlin said “both past FEMA and the City bear responsibility” for the delays. She listed “several failures” since the process started in 2023, including “FEMA staff changing up” and indecision by the city government.
By this summer, Naples officials were getting desperate. In June, one tried to enlist Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to press FEMA to move ahead. “We were told yesterday that Secretary Noem would have to ‘personally’ approve the Pier project before FEMA funding would be obligated,” the city official wrote to the senator’s staff. The Naples mayor, Teresa Heitmann, also personally wrote to FEMA. Heitmann said she was “perplexed” by the delays and begged the agency for guidance.
Heitmann had long been paying expensive Washington consultants to help her city navigate the process. But she was “feeling increasingly helpless,” she later said, until she had the idea that would finally put her project on the fast track. On July 18, the mayor emailed a Google search to herself: “Who is the head of Homeland security?” She was going to go straight to Noem.
Heitmann determined that her best bet for getting Noem’s attention was Gursoy. A Naples cardiologist, Gursoy has no obvious experience working with the federal government; much of his online footprint centers on his enthusiasm for pinball. But Gursoy gave Noem at least $25,000 to support her campaign for governor in 2022. That was enough to put him near the top of Noem’s disclosed donor list. (In South Dakota, campaign contributions remain relatively small.)
On planning documents for the 2024 Republican National Convention obtained by ProPublica, the Florida doctor is listed as an attendee affiliated with the delegation from South Dakota, a state he has no apparent connection to besides his support for Noem. Heitmann told ProPublica that Gursoy introduced her to Noem at a political event at a private home in Naples while Noem was governor.
“Hello it’s Teresa,” the mayor texted Gursoy in early August. “I really need your help.” She explained the tangle of bureaucracy she’d been contending with. “FEMA is holding us up,” Heitmann wrote. “Kristi Noem could put some fire under the FEMA employees slacking.”
Gursoy responded: “Okay. I will get on it.”
The next week, on Aug. 11, the doctor gave Heitmann an update. “Kristi was off for a few days for the first time in a long time, so I left her alone,” he said. “I just txted her now.” Within 24 hours, he had exciting news. He told the mayor to expect a call from Noem’s “FEMA fixer” shortly.

The identity of the “fixer” is not clear, but by Aug. 27, Naples officials were seeing a “flurry of activity” from Noem’s agency. That day, a FEMA staffer told the city that “FEMA is intending to expedite the funding” for the pier. “Secretary Noem took immediate action when I reached out to ask for help,” the mayor soon posted on Facebook.
Two days later, Noem flew to Naples. Her schedule listed a 30-minute walk-through at the pier with the mayor, followed by a nail salon appointment and dinner at Bleu Provence, which serves wagyu short ribs and seared foie gras. Noem then stayed through the weekend at the four-star Naples Bay Resort & Marina. Heitmann told ProPublica she wasn’t at the French dinner but Gursoy was. “I didn’t ask her to come, but she showed up,” the mayor told the local news. “I was very impressed.”
Before she left town, Noem posted about the Naples pier on Instagram. She was finally getting the project back on track, she said. “Americans deserve better than years of red tape and failed disaster responses,” Noem wrote. “Under @POTUS Trump, this incompetency ends.”
DHS did not answer questions about whether the government paid for Noem’s weekend in Naples.

In a Sept. 20 social media post, Trump had publicly pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey — with whom he has long feuded — and other political opponents. In the same post, Trump referenced the prosecutions against him to justify an investigation into his opponents. He also withdrew the nomination of a federal prosecutor in Virginia who reportedly resisted instructions to prosecute Comey and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer who had worked for Trump in his personal capacity. Trump celebrated the indictment in a Thursday evening post.“JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” Trump wrote. “One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI.”Asked by a reporter Friday morning if others would face retribution, Trump said he hoped so.“They weaponized the Justice Department like nobody in history,” he said. “What they've done is terrible. And so I would, frankly, I hope there are others, because you can't let this happen to a country.”Trump motives questionedTrump’s moves led Democrats and other Trump critics to describe Comey’s prosecution as an act of retribution meant to punish the president’s opponents, violating a longstanding norm separating the president from direct involvement in Justice Department activity.In an early Friday post to X, Patel sought to counter that narrative, saying professionals handled the investigation.“Career FBI agents, intel analysts, and staff led the investigation into Comey and others,” he wrote. “They called the balls and strikes and will continue to do so. The wildly false accusations attacking this FBI for the politicization of law enforcement comes from the same bankrupt media that sold the world on Russia Gate- it’s hypocrisy on steroids. Their baseless objections tell us now, more than ever, that we are precisely over the target and will remain on mission until completion.”Comey’s initial court date is scheduled for Oct. 9 in Alexandria, Virginia, in front of U.S. District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. His summons were served to Patrick Fitzgerald, a longtime federal prosecutor who is leading Comey’s defense.The grand jury charged Comey with lying to Congress and obstructing a proceeding of Congress related to his testimony to a Senate committee about whether he authorized FBI agents to leak information about a probe into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.Democrats blast indictmentIn a lengthy statement Thursday, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, called the indictment “blatantly fraudulent and vindictive.”“The rule of law was supposed to replace vendettas, blood feuds, and mad kings exacting vengeance on their perceived enemies,” Raskin wrote. “This sordid episode is one more savage assault on justice in America.”Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois called on Republicans to oppose Trump’s involvement with the Justice Department.“The Department of Justice has become a political tool of a vengeful President,” Durbin said in a Friday morning statement. “President Trump wears his corruption like a badge of honor and defies anyone daring to challenge him. The Attorney General willingly complies with every order from the White House.

“I still possess the heart and desire to serve the people of Connecticut,” Tooker said in a statement, adding that as she closes her campaign, “I will be actively exploring other avenues in which my name can remain on the ballot in November of 2026.”
Tooker’s announcement comes two weeks before the deadline for reporting third-quarter fundraising. In July, she reported raising $81,252 since declaring her candidacy in March. Tooker also contributed $20,000 of her own funds.
“I entered this race to be the next Governor of Connecticut as a true outsider who feels the call to serve the state I love, knowing that this amazing state is in desperate need of a course correction,” she wrote. “However, after very serious thought and deliberation, it has become clear to me that the voters need more time to get to know me, and I need more time to get to know them.”
Her departure leaves Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich as the only Republican waging an active campaign for governor. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who has been raising money since January through an exploratory committee, is expected to declare after the municipal elections in November.
Three other Republicans have declared campaigns for other statewide offices: Matt Corey for lieutenant governor, former Rep. Fred Wilms for treasurer and Peter Lumaj for secretary of the state.
No Republican has won statewide office in Connecticut since Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2006.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the other five Democratic constitutional officers are expected to run in 2026. Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas is the only among them to have created a campaign committee.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has over a dozen offices and facilities in Louisiana, researching in fields such as coastal restoration, weather forecasting and fisheries science. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A new interactive map highlights the impact of a government agency that’s provided critical climate information as the Trump administration has targeted it for budget cuts and reduced research.   
The nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund has released an online tool that tracks 735 subagencies under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and where the services they provide are used. Its analysis includes the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.
After taking office, President Donald Trump authorized billionaire Elon Musk to evaluate spending and efficiency throughout the federal government. Musk’s unofficial Department of Government Efficiency was ordered to cut 10% of its workforce, which includes more than 10,000 employees.
“This transparency is more important than ever,” Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a press release. “DOGE’s attacks on NOAA programs are already undermining our safety from extreme weather, and any additional cuts to weather reporting and storm tracking would threaten our communities even further.”
NOAA provides daily weather forecasts and emergency alerts for extreme weather across the county, including hurricane forecasting and storm tracking. The agency also leads climate research, coastal restoration and fisheries monitoring work both within the agency and through local partnerships. 
Louisiana has more than a dozen NOAA offices, ranging from weather forecasting stations to oceanic monitoring hubs. The agency is also involved in several issues central to the environmental and economic health of Louisiana, such as the annual Gulf dead zone forecast and coastal restoration.
Highlights from the map include the Estuarine Habitats and Coastal Fisheries Center in Lafayette, the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center in Slidell and the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program based in Baton Rouge. 
The map is based on publicly available data from NOAA and other official sources to show where offices and research centers are and what budget cuts could impact. 
“The ‘NOAA in Your State’ tool is one of the most useful government products available to us all,” Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator under President Joe Biden, said in the news release.
NOAA’s data being publicly available is a keystone feature of the agency’s work, Spinrad added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9455-scaled-e1758901930968-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Courtesy of S.C. State Ports Authority)When an Upstate soybean processing facility abruptly shut down in April, South Carolina leaders mobilized to find a way to save the crop and get it to new markets overseas.
Now, the state’s farmers are facing another potential crisis – a trade war with China that threatens to eliminate a key soybean customer just as this year’s crop is ready for harvest.
“Farmers are frustrated and they’re concerned right now,” said Eva Moore, spokeswoman for the S.C. Department of Agriculture. “Without China, it’s a lot harder to get good prices and negotiate good deals.”
China is historically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing more than half of American farmers’ annual harvest. And soybeans are America’s biggest export to China, in terms of value. Last year, China bought $12.6 billion worth of soybeans, the New York Times reported.
But this year, China has not placed any orders for U.S. soybeans – the result of a tariff war between that country and the Trump administration. China is instead buying billions of dollars of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.
“U.S. soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice,” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a written statement. “Soybean farmers are under extreme financial stress … (and) cannot survive a prolonged trade war with our largest customer.”
In South Carolina, soybeans are the largest crop by acreage, with most of the growing centered in the Pee Dee region. There were 380,000 acres harvested in 2024 – that’s 13 million bushels worth $138.2 million, according to the state’s agriculture department.
Fitzhugh Bethea, a Dillon County farmer and chairman of the S.C. Soybean Board, said this year’s harvest is expected to be a little below average, with a projected 7% decline. Couple that with soybean prices that have steadily eroded in recent years, and state farmers are worried.
Imports spur stellar August for SC Ports, but tariff troubles await

Farmers “can go out of business in a season if they can’t sell their 2025 crop,” Moore said.
Stepping up
South Carolina has rallied to help its soybean farmers in the past.
As trade tensions with China heightened this spring, Archer Daniels Midland suddenly announced it would close a soybean processing facility in Kershaw that had served farmers for half a century.
That left many of the state’s farmers with no way to process soybeans in storage from last year’s crop, and – with China’s refusal to buy the U.S. product – nowhere to ship them if they could be processed.
The S.C. State Ports Authority reacted by partnering with the state’s agriculture department and private businesses to move 3 million bushels of those soybeans through Inland Port Dillon in the following months.
The authority found new markets for the soybeans in Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia. Container shipping giants CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express agreed to move 2,800 cargo containers full of soybeans to those markets, leading to a 35% jump in exports through the inland port.
South Carolina’s inland ports provide rail links to move cargo containers from points away from the coast to and from the Port of Charleston. The authority also has an inland port in Greer.
“We went to some of the ocean carriers who are big players into Dillon and sort of just said, ‘We have a situation in South Carolina where a huge demand for beans is going away – we’ve got a surplus – and could you help us?’,” said Byron Miller, the authority’s chief commercial officer. “And they stepped up. They got involved in pricing and ensuring there was an avenue to get those beans to market.”
Soybeans, grains and agricultural products rank as the third-biggest export commodity from the Port of Charleston, with nearly 90,000 containers measured in 20-foot increments leaving the port for foreign markets each year. Soybeans and grains are the top commodity exported from the inland port in Dillon.
“By working together, we were able to quickly develop new soybean markets and make a real difference for South Carolina farmers,” Hugh Weathers, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said in a written statement.

 
Uncertain future
With a new soybean crop ready to be harvested in the next couple of months, the state’s agriculture department plans to work with farmers to try to offset impacts from the trade war with China.
The agency plans to hold a “listening call” with growers to get input and “we’re going to see if there’s something more we can do with the port to ease the problem,” Moore said.
The state Department of Agriculture also has a Growing Agribusiness Fund it can tap for initiatives to help soybean farmers. About $9 million of the $40 million legislators put in the fund in 2023 remains available, she said.
China said this week it won’t buy any U.S. soybeans unless what it terms “unreasonable” retaliatory tariffs of 34% are removed by the Trump administration.
Trade talks are continuing, and a top Chinese trade negotiator met with political and business leaders from the U.S. Midwest earlier this week, signaling a breakthrough could be near.
That would be good news for South Carolina, the nation’s 22nd-largest producer of soybeans, and farmers in the Midwest, where the bulk of U.S. soybeans are grown.
In the meantime, however, the state’s soybean farmers are getting ready for harvest with the world’s top buyer boycotting their crop. That could force them to store their harvest to avoid having to sell soybeans at a huge loss.
The stalemate is also spurring talk at the White House of new federal aid to keep farmers afloat, similar to measures President Donald Trump took in 2019 when the trade war began.
On Thursday, Trump indicated a bailout will come from money collected from tariffs.
“We’re going to take some of that tariff money we’ve made, we’re going to give it to our farmers who are for a little while going to be hurting until the tariffs kick in to their benefit,” Trump told reporters. “So, we’re going to make sure our farmers are in great shape because we’re taking in a lot of money.”
He didn’t offer any specifics.
“If there’s not a trade deal, there has to be some kind of relief for farmers,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/soybeans-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

Shapiro, don’t sell Pa. out to polluters",Josephine Gingerich,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/commentary/gov-shapiro-dont-sell-pa-out-to-polluters/,"The state is facing major health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and oil and gas infrastructure. We need leaders to choose people over polluters.","A complex of data centers in Ashburn, Va. (Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)Pennsylvania is at the epicenter of a dangerous fossil fuel agenda — and unfortunately, Governor Josh Shapiro is paving the way. 
Since taking office, Shapiro has taken no meaningful climate action. Instead, he has advanced fossil fuel interests by fast-tracking permits for so-called “reliable” energy — a phrase used to greenwash gas, biodigesters, and other methane-emitting projects. And he promotes an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, which props up oil and gas under the guise of sustainability. Too often, he sides with polluters over people. 
Our state has been part of the U.S. Climate Alliance since 2019, a coalition committed to a net-zero future by advancing state-led, high-impact climate action. Yet Pennsylvania is America’s second largest extractor of fossil fuels — and no significant climate-mitigating legislation has been established during Shapiro’s tenure as governor. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump has a bullseye on Pennsylvania shale gas, with promises of liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals, massive AI data centers powered by dedicated gas-fired power plants, and additional false solutions like pyrolysis (burning plastic, which creates toxic emissions) and carbon capture and sequestration (an ineffective and dangerous attempt at storing carbon underground, transported through hazardous pipelines that can poison communities with CO2 gas leaks). These projects only delay the transition to real renewable energy.
Data centers bring the threat of noise, higher electric bills, water pollution, and high water usage. And in Pennsylvania, they also bring the health harms of increased fracking and new gas-fired power plants. Amazon and Blackstone plan to use fracked gas to fuel their data centers. And proposed LNG export terminals bring incredible risks of explosion and pollution to densely populated areas on the East Coast. 
A bill in the state House, HB 502, is being shoehorned into state budget legislation after failing to get out of committee. It allows a centralized board to override municipal land use decisions by issuing a “Certificate of Reliable Energy Supply.” Once that certificate is granted, municipalities are legally barred from taking any action that might “materially impede” the project — even if that action is rooted in zoning law, comprehensive planning, or legitimate public health and safety concerns.

Yet Shapiro’s administration is pushing the bill hard, threatening the autonomy and voices of the people of Pennsylvania. In fact, Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania’s constitution — the Environmental Rights Amendment — establishes the people’s right to clean air and pure water, and requires all levels of government, including municipalities, to act as trustees of our natural resources. By stripping towns of their authority to protect residents through zoning and planning, HB 502 prevents them from fulfilling that constitutional duty. Courts have already struck down similar overreach in the Robinson Township case. 
Instead of being a champion for his constituents who are suffering health harms from fossil fuel extraction in the state, Gov. Shapiro has been busy developing alliances and deals with the gas industry, creating significant roadblocks to meaningful climate action. Now, with the announcement from President Trump of over $90 billion coming to Pennsylvania for an AI hub in our state, our communities face major threats of increased pollution and health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and other oil and gas infrastructure.
We need Gov. Shapiro not to sell us out. Instead, he needs to hold polluters accountable.

That means stop pushing AI data centers powered by fracked gas. It means stop backing LNG exports and false solutions like burning plastic, carbon capture, and hydrogen production from fracked gas. It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov. Shapiro should  make good on promises to address the toxic impacts of fracking and ban road spreading of toxic, radioactive drilling waste.
We’re watching closely. Pennsylvanians demand leadership that centers on genuine community collaboration, real solutions to the health crisis created by fracking, high-impact actions on the climate crisis, and on respect for frontline communities where residents are suffering. 
Pennsylvania can lead the way in creating union jobs, building renewable energy, protecting communities, and ensuring every family has clean air and water.

Without action, the affordability crisis will deepen, and more of our neighbors will be pushed to the brink.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leo Schiff: Wages matter — Making a case for permanently affordable housing in Vermont.","This commentary is by Leo Schiff, of Brattleboro. Schiff is the board chair of the Windham & Windsor Housing Trust.


The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s newly released Out of Reach report offers a sobering reminder of the growing disconnect between wages and the cost of rent in Vermont — and across the nation. It confirms what we experience every day in our work at Windham & Windsor Housing Trust: that hardworking Vermonters, seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers simply cannot afford the cost of a safe, stable home without support.
According to the report, there is no county in the United States where a full-time minimum wage worker can afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. Here in Windham and Windsor Counties, the wage needed to afford such a home is $26 (Windham) and $25 (Windsor) per hour, while the average renter earns far less. The result is that many households are spending more than half of their income just to keep a roof over their heads. That leaves so many in our community dangerously close to crisis — one car repair, medical bill or missed paycheck away from eviction or homelessness.
These are not abstract statistics. These are real people: working families, elders on fixed incomes, single parents juggling multiple jobs and individuals with disabilities. Many cannot work full-time or at all, and the supports they rely on — rental subsidies, housing vouchers and other lifeline programs — are now facing massive proposed federal cuts. Without action, the affordability crisis will deepen, and more of our neighbors will be pushed to the brink.
This is why the Windham & Windsor Housing Trust’s work to develop and maintain permanently affordable housing is more critical than ever. With the recent completion of Central and Main in downtown Windsor, we now have over 900 affordable apartments, and 147 shared equity homes across Windham and Windsor counties. We have 95 more either under construction or in development. Every project is designed with the long-term in mind: built to last with high-efficiency systems, renewable energy where possible and universal accessibility. We often carry out environmental remediation to safely reuse downtown land, contributing to smart growth and sustainability.
What makes our approach unique is that affordability doesn’t expire after 15 or 20 years, as it often does in other states. Our housing remains affordable forever. That means families who move in today — and those who come after them — can count on having a safe, stable home they can afford well into the future. That’s how we preserve economic diversity in our communities, protect people from displacement and ensure public investment continues to pay off for decades.
These developments are not easy. They are highly complex and often financially daunting. But that’s why nonprofits like Windham & Windsor Housing Trust exist — to step in where the market won’t and to deliver lasting impact. Our developments are made possible through innovative public-private partnerships. About 60% of our funding comes from private investment, primarily through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. The remaining 40% is made up of state and federal dollars. These modest public investments leverage millions in private funds — and in return, communities gain long-term housing assets that generate property and school tax revenue each year.
Permanently affordable housing isn’t just a response to crisis. It’s a promise — to today’s Vermonters and the generations to come — that our communities will remain places where everyone can belong, contribute and thrive.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills on Friday announced her official opposition to a statewide referendum that will ask voters if they want to institute tougher gun safety regulations, arguing the proposed red flag law will ultimately undermine public safety.
Question 2 on the November ballot will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
Maine is the only state that has what’s known as a yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. Red flag laws, known as extreme risk protection orders, are active in twenty-one states, including four in New England. 
Before the Oct. 25, 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, the yellow flag law had been used sparingly as law enforcement had reported it was cumbersome. 
An independent commission investigating the Lewiston tragedy determined that under the current law, local law enforcement had sufficient probable cause to take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. That has both fueled calls for stronger protections as well as prompted more frequent use of the yellow flag law.
In an op-ed in the Portland Press Herald, Mills cites the 1,100 times that the yellow flag law has been used to remove weapons and protect individuals and the public. “Our law has been preventing suicide, getting people help and saving lives every day,” she wrote.
“Question 2 would create a new, separate and confusing process that will undermine the effectiveness of the law and endanger public safety along with it,” she added.
After the Maine Legislature failed to pass several more restrictive gun safety measures in the wake of the shooting, the Maine Gun Safety Coalition launched the referendum effort and in January delivered more than 80,000 petition signatures in support of the red flag proposal.

The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
Advocating in favor of the current model, Mills argues that involving law enforcement early “takes the burden off you as a family member for ‘turning in’ someone who’s close to you” and points out that “law enforcement can access more information” and navigate the court system more easily than members of the public.
The governor also said that “involving law enforcement provides another important level of due process that strengthens the law’s constitutionality.”
In the commentary, Mills explained how Maine’s unique law came together through a consensus process, which she helped lead. 
“Our law is not some cookie cutter measure copied and pasted from another state. It was written by and for Maine people, carefully crafted to include important due process safeguards that protect both public safety and the rights of the individual,” she wrote. “We found common ground on one of the most controversial issues of our time.”
The governor had teased her opposition to a red flag law in her State of the Budget address in January, during which she said, “It is the government’s responsibility, not that of a private citizen, to protect the public from gun violence.”
Earlier this week, advocates and opponents of the referendum effort held a debate on the proposal. 
During the televised town hall, former Public Safety Commissioner Anne Jordan, who also served as executive director of the independent commission on the Lewiston shooting, described the yellow flag law as a “failed” experiment.

(Montana Farmers Union photo)Joining hundreds of other farmers across the country, 14 members of the Montana Farmers Union joined the organization’s legislative fly-in earlier this month in Washington, D.C., to voice concerns about a future farm bill even as tariffs take a toll on the agriculture sector.
The annual event comes as farmer advocacy groups across the country are asking the federal government to reauthorize the Farm Bill, which is how the United States has dictated large portions of the country’s agricultural policy. It has not been reauthorized since 2018, though some parts of it were folded into the “Big Beautiful” reconciliation bill, passed without Democratic support earlier this year. 
That included a measure that allowed single entities to increase the amount of crop insurance coverage they can get. This essentially allowed large corporations to increase the amount of taxpayer funded insurance subsidies they could get and did not benefit smaller farmers, Montana Farmers Union President Walter Schweitzer said Thursday, because it equated to a cap increase.
Crop insurance is where the majority of Farm Bill money goes, and there are ways to fix it, he added.
A step system could be put in place, for example, that would allow a farmer who needs $1 million in insurance coverage could get a higher percentage of that covered by taxpayers than a corporation that needs $30 million in insurance.
Farmers across the country are advocating for the Farm Bill to be reauthorized, saying not having the certainty of the bill is not conducive to an industry that thrives on stability.
Schweitzer has also heard the criticism, mostly coming from progressive circles, that American farmers voted for President Donald Trump and are therefore getting what they asked for.
“I don’t disagree that there’s farm organizations out there that have been very vocal in support of this administration, but their members are really questioning what they did,” Schweitzer said. “I’ve got farmers who are calling me from these other farm organizations that are freaking out about the tariffs.”
Those tariffs continue to be a major concern, Schweitzer said, because it has caused some countries to simply buy agricultural products from other countries. 
Schweitzer is also a supporter for rural mental health care and said stress is impacting those working in the industry. He’s lost several friends this year, all farmers and ranchers, to suicide, he said.
He also sees the general economic situation around American agriculture to be deeply troubling, drawing comparisons to the 1980s Farm Crisis.
“In the ‘80s, we weren’t pissing off our customers, we just made some really bad financial decisions in our ag policies,” Schweitzer said. “But now we’re not only making bad decisions on ag policy, but we’re pissing off all our customers, and our standing in the world is diminishing drastically every second.”
Farmers Union members also are pushing labeling on food, indicating what country it came from as well as what’s called “Right to Repair” legislation, which would allow people to buy parts and repair their own equipment, something that is not always possible.
The other major, ongoing issue related to tariffs, Schweitzer said, is that farmers are not finding places to sell their products. China, which bought $12.3 billion in soybeans last year, has not bought any this year, the New York Times reported.
“Even if we get past this current trade war, even if we get past this current economic situation, I don’t see a very bright future for American agriculture as we need those markets, and we’re going to struggle to get them back worldwide,” Schweitzer said. “Global buyers are going to buy from us as a last resort from here on out.”
Outside Sidney, Sarah Degn is watching the soybean issue play out in front of her.
“Things like the trade war are really hitting home this time of year,” Degn said. “I mean, I’m going to start combining soybeans tomorrow, and I’m not totally sure what’s happening with all of them yet.”
Sidney lost its sugar beet factory several years ago, which prompted a change for farmers in the area. Degn, a member of the Montana Farmers Union, was in the nation’s capital during the fly-in.
“You feel like when you talk to these people and they’re listening and their staff are listening, and you’ve made progress, and then you hear the people at the top say, well, until the President says it’s OK, we can’t do anything,” Degn said. “So you get the feeling they want to help, but they’re waiting for permission.”
Representatives from the Montana Farmers Union met with members of the state’s delegation, including U.S. Reps Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing. Schweitzer said Rep. Downing and Sen. Tim Sheehy were receptive to more legislation around food packaging.
The Farmers Union is pushing for clearer packaging on meat products, which is called “Country of Origin Labeling” or, COOL.
The problem, Schweitzer said, is that some beef raised in other countries is then processed in America, letting those companies slap a United States label on the beef. Regulations on beef differ from the U.S. in other meat-producing countries like Brazil and Mexico.
Quality beef has long been a hallmark of American beef production and while products from other countries would likely be cheaper than domestic meat, Schweitzer thinks the customer will be able to taste the difference.
“I am convinced that they may buy that package one or two times, or they may buy that with they’re pinching pennies and don’t have enough money to buy other products,” Schweitzer said. “But there’s no doubt in my mind, given the choice, they would always prefer to buy beef.”
The labeling push echoes some state legislation discussed during the past session, including a “checkoff” bill that would have created a program to market Montana beef. A similar program for wheat already exists.

May is expected to appear in court Monday afternoon to officially plead guilty. He faces between five and 20 years in prison for each of the five counts, plus fines that could amount to more than $285,000 for each charge, according to the plea agreement.
Prosecutors tied an account on messaging app Kik flagged for sending child sexual abuse videos to May’s home Wi-Fi and cellphone, they said previously. After seizing May’s phone and laptop last August, prosecutors determined May was the person behind the Kik account, according to court filings.

The three parties signed a memorandum of understanding that they would explore the possibility of siting a TerraPower nuclear reactor in Evergy’s Kansas territory, they announced in a Tuesday news release.
TerraPower, headquartered in Washington, is proposing a Natrium power plant, which uses liquid sodium as a coolant rather than water, according to the company’s website.
“Unlike today’s Light Water Reactors, the Natrium reactor is a 345-megawatt sodium fast reactor coupled with TerraPower’s breakthrough innovation — a molten salt energy storage system, providing built-in gigawatt-scale energy storage,” the website said.
The agreement allows TerraPower and Evergy to evaluate site-specific characteristics for the Natrium power plant and to “explore the Natrium plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers,” the release said.
Site selection is based on everything from community support to necessary physical  characteristics, as well as the ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure, the news release said.
“My administration has always supported an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in the news release. “We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I’m pleased we’re using innovative methods to do just that.”
Evergy CEO David Campbell said nuclear energy would give the company the opportunity to add reliable energy options that don’t emit greenhouse gases.
“This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants,” he said in the news release.
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of Climate + Energy Project, said her organization’s mission is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably, and she appreciates that advanced nuclear reactors can support part of that mission.
However, she’s concerned about the cost of such a power plant and what that would mean for customer bills.
“I am concerned with what I read about cost to build these advanced nuclear reactors and projects,” she said. “I believe one figure I saw for the Wyoming plant that TerraPower is building, which is 345 megawatts, was $4 billion.”

(Photo by Ed Tibbetts)Fifteen months ago, the people of Davenport got a step closer to greater transparency in the long-running controversy over the city’s decision to pay $1.9 million to three former employees to drop their harassment allegations.
In a June 2024 opinion, a Scott County district judge said, over the city’s objections, that State Auditor Rob Sand was entitled to access the closed sessions of the city council held in connection with this issue. Sand had earlier subpoenaed records, including recordings, of the closed meetings.
In addition to saying Sand was entitled to the sessions to ensure compliance with the law, Judge Jeffrey Bert ordered an “in camera,” or private review by the court, of the meetings in order to exclude attorney work product and material irrelevant to the investigation. He also directed an evidentiary hearing be held to help the court understand what information Sand believed to be relevant.
Insofar as the search for transparency in this case is concerned, not a lot has changed since then.
The city appealed to the Supreme Court and in the interim, a dispute between Sand, a Democrat, and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, a Republican, broke out over who would represent the auditor’s office in the case.
In two weeks, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear their arguments.
This dispute isn’t central to the concerns the people of Davenport have over the city’s decision to settle the claims—and its subsequent attempts to shield itself from public disclosure in the matter.
Still, the dispute between Bird and Sand is no small matter. The questions center on the powers of each office.
Earlier this year, the state auditor’s office told the court it planned to represent itself following a disagreement with the attorney general’s office over how to proceed in the case, citing differences over how to approach the issue of confidential information. (The city’s appeal of the district court ruling claimed the case was a “direct assault” on attorney-client privilege.)
In a brief filed with the high court, through its general counsel, Sand’s office said the city’s appeal isn’t ripe for review, but if the court found otherwise, it should affirm the district judge’s order. Citing state law, the auditor’s office said it has the right to subpoena “all information” and “records” related to the city’s duties, regardless of whether they are privileged.
Bird’s office also says the city’s appeal isn’t ripe for review but adds she “prudently declined” to press an argument relating to abrogating attorney-client privilege with which “the Supreme Court is almost certain to disagree.”
Now the two sides are arguing who gets to represent the auditor’s office before the Supreme Court.

In a filing last month, Bird’s office, citing state law, said she has the “exclusive duty” to represent any state officer in court. Sand’s office, however, argues rather than a dispute over litigation strategy, this is an attempt to limit the role of a fellow constitutional officer. It says Sand seeks potentially privileged information and Bird “does not want the Auditor to be able to access such information.”
Bird’s office, however, has said in a court filing the auditor’s preferred argument “risked an adverse decision that could limit the Auditor’s authority” and that the attorney general’s duty isn’t to represent a particular auditor, but the office of the auditor.
This is happening against a backdrop of previous disputes between Sand and Republicans over the Legislature’s moves to limit his powers. Two years ago, Republicans passed a law that effectively bars Sand from going to court to force resisting state agencies to turn over documents. It also limits the auditor’s ability to access certain personal information.
Amid all this, the people of Davenport continue to wait for whatever findings, if any, Sand’s reaudit might produce.
Sand’s office has said the records from the city’s closed sessions are vital to the investigation. “Without the recordings of the closed sessions, the reaudit ends,” it said in a filing this month.
It’s not clear how long the various issues regarding the closed sessions might be tangled up in the courts. Sand also has announced he is running for governor next year, meaning that, come 2027, Iowa will likely have a new auditor.
What then? Will the new auditor pursue this case if it hasn’t already been concluded—and in what way?
We’re nearing the two-year anniversary of the agreement between the City of Davenport and former City Administrator Corri Spiegel that resulted in paying her $1.6 million to settle her claims.
Since then, citizens, journalists and state officials have sought to drag answers out of the city. I have tended to believe, like Sand, the contents of the city council’s closed sessions are vitally important. In my opinion, they have the potential to shine a brighter light on how these decisions came to be. However, with all that is transpiring, it is not clear to me this light will be forthcoming soon, if it ever shines at all.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier on Friday accused a Democratic state attorney he’s long-feuded with of declining to prosecute pedophiles.
Uthmeier hosted an Orlando press conference Friday morning to castigate Monique Worrell, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties, for failing to prosecute a man who allegedly masturbated in front of children and another man accused of possessing thousands of videos of child pornography.
This was Uthmeier’s second press conference in a month targeting Worrell, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis removed from office in 2023 but subsequently won reelection.
“This is systematic abuse. This is gross negligence,” Uthmeier said, demanding she “reconsider” the dropped charges or he will try to get the case reassigned to another attorney. “[Worrell] took an oath, she’s not delivering on that oath, and we’re going to step up and do what we can to hold her accountable and to protect our citizens.”
Of note, the power to suspend and remove state attorneys lies solely with the governor. The attorney general exercises a mere “superintendent” role over Florida’s 20 elected state attorneys.
Worrell’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Monique Worrell via her webpage
Uthmeier has long-clashed with Worrell. Earlier this month, he hinted that she should be suspended — again — for bringing a second-degree murder case against a women Uthmeier believes acted in self-defense. He recited the Florida Constitution’s ground for suspension of an elected official at a press conference, before asking her to investigate a former Democratic state senator for posting the location of ICE agents.
In April, amid a weeks-long war of words between Uthmeier, accused by her of being “uninformed,” and Worrell, whom he called “soft on crime,” the AG claimed she was ignoring a mounting backlog of cases. When Uthmeier served as DeSantis’ chief of staff, the governor suspended Worrell in August 2023 for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Despite this, she retook her seat in November 2024 when voters chose her over Andrew Bain, appointed by DeSantis to replace her.
What are the cases that weren’t prosecuted?
According to a letter sent from the attorney general’s office to Worrell, there were two cases involving children that Worrell declined to prosecute. The first involves a man named Kevin Chapman, 61, arrested for lewd and lascivious exhibition in the presence of a child under 16.
“Not only did your office fail to pursue pretrial detention, but it declined to charge him, claiming that the case was ‘not suitable for prosecution,'” Uthmeier wrote. “I strongly encourage you to reconsider dismissing the charge against Chapman.”
The other case Worrell allegedly declined to prosecute was against Thomas Dolgos, who had his electronics searched and seized in June. During the search, Dolgos admitted to possessing child pornography. A preliminary view of his devices suggested thousands of images of child pornography, the letter says.
The Office of Statewide Prosecution assumed the case, but Uthmeier claims that an attorney from Worrell’s office “inexplicably” dismissed all charges and discharged Dolgos’ bond, freeing him. Dolgos was apprehended at the Canada border and the statewide prosecutor charged him with an additional 48 counts of child pornography.
“Your office’s dismissal of Dolgos’ charges was an unacceptable mistake,” Uthmeier wrote. “Your office should never dismiss a case OSP is managing. … At best, it suggests a lack of adequate training in your office. Please address this deficiency and make sure it does not happen again.”

Williams is one of two members of the Jackson Police Department’s neighborhood enhancement team, or NET. Formed in early 2024, the officers lead efforts to clean up illegal dump sites across the city.

The duo performs daily patrols around Jackson, surveying common locations where people dump their trash, such as Shaw Road or Greenhill Place in southwest Jackson. Williams said in recent months, he’s noticed that a larger number of people who have been charged with dumping are traveling from outside of the city to dump sites in Jackson. They choose areas that are low-traffic without visible streetlights or cameras.
“It’s secluded,” Williams said, as he steered one of the team’s patrol vehicles down a road overgrown with weeds. “This is the perfect spot for them to come and take three to five minutes, dump some stuff and keep it rolling.”

On Aug. 12, the Jackson City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that created additional penalties for illegal dumping, including stiffer jail time, a minimum of 32 days, and the immediate seizure of the vehicle used for dumping. 
“This is not just about punishing offenders; it’s about protecting our people, our neighborhoods, and our pride. We want a Jackson that’s cleaner, brighter, and safer, and today’s vote is a step toward that vision,” Ward 4 councilman and council president Brian Grizzell said in a statement after the meeting.

Officer Gloria Blue, the other half of NET, said they collect a wide range of debris from the streets, such as mattresses, bookshelves, carpets and paint materials.
“Anything you can renovate, anything you can take out of a house, they dump,” Blue said.
In recent months, Blue said she’s seen a decrease in large items, such as furniture, they’ve had to pick up. Hinds County supervisors and the police department have placed cameras on streets in south and west Jackson, such as Glen Erin Street or Lindbergh Drive, deterring would-be offenders from dumping.
“It has really slowed down. Now, we’ll probably have one or two couches every couple weeks, but it used to be every single day,” Blue said.

One initiative JPD has implemented is the Clean Sweep Program, allowing people who are caught dumping the opportunity to clean up the mess they made and reduce their fines. Many people who receive fines aren’t able to pay them, Williams said. One of the JPD neighborhood enhancement team’s main goals is to prosecute people who are guilty of illegal dumping. 
 “We investigate to make arrests,” Williams said. “We don’t just do clean-up. We investigate.”

NET also works in collaboration with the city of Jackson to enforce ordinances surrounding dumping and eyesores in the community, such as hoards of items in a yard or rubber tires piled high.
“We have to call Solid Waste and code enforcement for anything that we can’t get that’s on private property,” Blue said.

She said that while NET does respond to tips from concerned residents, many of the sites they clear are from their dedicated surveillance of the city.
“Every now and then, we may get a call about something new,” Blue said. “But it’s an everyday cycle.”

Andy Beshear has signed two emergency regulations updating policies for restrictive housing, previously called isolation, for the state’s Department of Juvenile Justice. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer) Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has signed two emergency regulations updating policies for restrictive housing, previously called isolation, for the state’s Department of Juvenile Justice. 
Beshear announced the regulations Thursday and called them a strong plan to change the system, which has received criticism in recent years over care of youth offenders. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights investigation into the conditions at eight of the state’s youth detention centers and one development center.
The governor’s emergency regulations require leadership within the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) to review and approve time limits on restrictive housing for youth offenders, including more frequent medical and mental health evaluations, and training on the new policy for all DJJ staff who interact with youth. 
“For years, the juvenile justice system was overlooked, and now we’re making sweeping changes to overhaul the system to enhance safety and help more kids reach the second chance they deserve,” Beshear said in a statement. “From supporting the hardworking DJJ staff who show up every day to offering more opportunities for youth and addressing needs like mental health, I am proud of the progress we’re making.”
The regulations say that the federal justice department “recommended that DJJ make changes to its regulations and policies governing the use of restrictive housing and protective custody placements.” 
Kentucky Republican Auditor Allison Ball, who has battled the governor on a host of issues in recent months, said in a statement Thursday night that she was “pleased” to see his changes following a 2024 audit from her office and the investigation by the Biden administration. 
“The audit revealed harsh and alarming conditions in DJJ facilities,” Ball said. “Kentucky’s youth deserve better, and my office will closely monitor whether these regulations actually address the findings of my audit.”
Ball’s report said juvenile detention facilities are “significantly understaffed,” leading to “high levels of overtime” that “negatively impact recruitment and retention.” It also found the Detention Division of DJJ “lacks a unified strategic direction,” as facilities and major departments are operating in “silos” and “conflicting communication” led to confusion “regarding its detention mission.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 10:59:23.498332

Court records indicate licensed practical nurse Tanya Lynn Jordan, 46, of West Liberty, was charged in July 2024 with tampering with records and felony theft of the narcotic hydrocodone.
Prosecutors alleged Jordan was working as a nurse at Cedar County’s Crestview Specialty Care when, on multiple occasions, she charted that she had given a resident of the home hydrocodone but kept the drugs for her own use.

In January 2025, Jordan agreed to a plea deal that in April 2025 resulted in a dismissal of the theft charge and a conviction on the misdemeanor tampering-with-records charge. She was sentenced to two years of probation.
Five months later, on Sept. 10, 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing, imposed an emergency adjudicative order in the case. Citing the need to prevent or avoid “immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare,” the board immediately suspended Jordan’s license to practice nursing in Iowa.
At the same time, the board formally charged Jordan with misappropriating medications of a patient or clinic, falsifying records related to the practice of nursing, committing an act that might adversely affect the welfare of a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the practice of nursing.
Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Jordan for comment.

In this image, Davids speaks to supporters Nov. 5, 2024, in Overland Park while winning reelection to a new two-year term. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Maneuvering by Republicans to convene a special legislative session in November to realign the state’s four congressional districts prompted U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to dust off her 2022 playbook to fend off the GOP’s last attempt to gerrymander her out of office.
Davids was elected in 2018 by Republicans, Democrats and independents in a 3rd District dominated by voters in Wyandotte and Johnson counties. She won reelection by double digits in 2022 and 2024, despite efforts by Kansas GOP legislators to undercut Davids by removing the northern half of Wyandotte County from the 3rd District and adding three rural counties.
Davids, who is the only woman, Native American and Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, denounced the new gerrymandering campaign under development by Kansas Republicans. She said advance work on a legislative session to transform the state’s 3-1 partisan split into a 4-0 GOP monolith was designed to appease President Donald Trump.
“Let’s be clear. Kansans deserve fair representation. Not backroom deals,” Davids said. “Republicans in Topeka know their politically motivated plan to once again silence Kansans and gerrymander the state isn’t popular, which is why they’re trying to do it in secret.”
She said sprinkling Johnson County voters across multiple GOP-controlled districts would require Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins to break commitments to a map keeping Johnson County united as a community of interest. In 2022, Masterson and Hawkins said it was fair to have Johnson County as the core of the Kansas City-area’s 3rd District.
“They are breaking their promise to not split up Johnson County and putting their political futures and Donald Trump’s demands ahead of Kansans’ voices,” Davids said. “Voters, not politicians, should choose their representatives.”
 
Sarnecki 100% on board
Philip Sarnecki, a Johnson County businessman and Republican candidate for governor, said there should be no hesitation by the Legislature to deliver for Trump.
“I met with President Trump’s political team at the White House … and discussed redistricting in Kansas,” Sarnecki said. “I am 100% in favor of redrawing the congressional map and adding a Republican seat in Congress.”
Masterson, an Andover Republican and also a candidate for governor, told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that work of organizing a special session in Topeka — likely Saturday, Nov. 8 — to engage in reapportionment was a matter of “working out the details.” He told the Topeka Capital-Journal it was “disingenuous at best” for Gov. Laura Kelly to demand the Legislature convene public meetings to gather input on how congressional maps might be redrawn ahead of 2026 elections.
“If our congressional delegation, particularly our Republican delegation, is united behind it, I don’t see why we wouldn’t take it up,” Masterson told Fox4 in Kansas City, Missouri.
Hawkins, a Wichita lawmaker seeking the Republican nomination for state insurance commissioner, said “we’re not there” yet on formally adopting a framework for a special session on reapportionment. Hawkins, as well as Masterson, would be better positioned to earn Trump’s endorsement if they delivered on redistricting in Kansas to undermine Davids.
Typically, Kansas governors would call the Legislature into special session. The House and Senate leadership could bypass tradition by gathering petition signatures from two-thirds of the Senate and House.
If the Legislature were to produce a map improving odds of a Republican sweep of the four U.S. House districts, the legislation would likely be vetoed by Kelly. The Legislature would need two-thirds majorities for an override — 84 of 125 members of the House and 27 of 40 members of the Senate. The GOP leadership in both chambers could afford to lose no more than four Republican members to complete an override and implement a new map — pending an inevitable lawsuit.
 
Reapportionment skeptics
Rep. Mark Schreiber, a Republican from Emporia, said he wouldn’t be among GOP lawmakers backing a new map. He said redrawing Kansas’ congressional boundaries outside the regular 10-year cycle tied to the U.S. Census couldn’t be justified.
“I’ve not heard a good reason yet to go back and redistrict. What we’re doing now is playing with the rules of the game. I just don’t see there’s wide (public) support for it,” Schreiber said.
Sen. Brenda Dietrich, a Topeka Republican, said remapping could regrettably make Republican U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt more vulnerable to a challenge in the 2nd District.
“I always worry about unintended consequences,” she said.
She said diluting influence of moderates in Johnson County also could trigger a backlash against Republican candidates in Kansas House races in 2026.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat campaigning for governor, said the public should contact state representatives or senators to register opposition to this unique round of congressional redistricting. She said the GOP’s strategy was about “making it easier for extremists to take control.”
“This proposal aims to dilute the votes of the hundreds of thousands of Kansans. There is no reason to redistrict mid-decade except to rig the system in one party’s favor over another. That’s not democracy. That’s cheating,” she said.
Kansans haven’t been clamoring for a new congressional map, said Sen. Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa. She said hypothetical maps for Kansas illustrate GOP electoral goals could be achieved by splitting the 3rd District into two or three sections.
“Why redraw the map the Republicans celebrated as fair just three years ago?” Sykes said.
In a Kansas City Star story, Rep. Bill Sutton, R-Gardner, said “it’s a questionable decision to redesign the districts anytime there’s a change in president.”
Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, told the Star that breaking up Johnson County to shift political power “might end up maybe giving a court challenge a little bit more chance of succeeding.”
 
The Supreme Court
Legal challenges of a Kansas congressional map could wind up in front of the Kansas Supreme Court. It would be a near repeat of a battle leading to a 4-3 decision in 2022 upholding constitutionality of the GOP’s gerrymandered congressional map, which cut Wyandotte County in half and placed Lawrence in the 1st District.
Justice Caleb Stegall said in the majority opinion that lack of direction in the Kansas Constitution or Kansas law forbidding use of partisan political reasoning to shape congressional districts left the state’s highest court no alternative than approving the 2022 map.
“The use of partisan factors in district line drawing is not constitutionally prohibited,” Stegall wrote. “If the redistricting process is intended to have ‘substantial political consequences’ it is no surprise that our court has consistently rejected pleas to establish a bright line prohibition on politics in the redistricting process.”
He said the Legislature was free to adopt clear standards limiting partisan gerrymandering in Kansas. Such clear standards would provide the judiciary with tools to adjudicate claims of excessive partisan gerrymandering, he added.
There were two minority opinions from state Supreme Court justices. One was written by Justice Eric Rosen and the second by Justice Dan Biles. Biles’ dissent was joined by Rosen and Justice Melissa Standridge.
“The majority denies Kansans the very thing our founders envisioned: A people’s government that fervently guards the people’s equal benefit from and access to the law — regardless of what the narrower-in-scope center power has to say about it,” Rosen said.
Biles, with Rosen and Standridge concurring, said a judicial retreat wasn’t the answer when state actions crossed constitutional boundaries.
“Courts must intervene because a desire to harm politically disfavored groups is not a legitimate government interest,” Biles said.
Stegall’s majority opinion in 2022 was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justices K.J. Wall and Evelyn Wilson. It could be significant, if there were a fresh challenge to a new congressional map, that Wilson retired from the Supreme Court. On Sept. 16, she was replaced by Justice Larkin Walsh.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/KVP-10-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-26 10:59:23.498332

Travis Beal Jacobs, 89, Fletcher D. Proctor Professor Emeritus of American History at Middlebury College, the son of Albert C. and Loretta Beal Jacobs, died at his home in Bridport, VT on September 16th, surrounded by his loved ones.
He graduated from Deerfield Academy and Princeton University ’58 cum laude. Planning to attend Columbia Law School, at the last minute he switched to the graduate program in American History for his Ph.D. 1965 he joined the faculty at Middlebury College and soon began teaching a popular two-semester lecture course on 20th Century American History. He served as Department Chair for seventeen years. “One of the first . . . chairs to embrace the College’s aspirations in minority recruiting,” he was ”certainly the most conspicuously successful.” His publications include America and the Russo-Finnish Winter War, 1939-1940; co-editing Navigating the Rapids, 1918-1971, the Diaries of a Adolf A. Berle, a FDR Brain Truster; and Eisenhower at Columbia. He also edited the Middlebury College General Catalogue: Bicentennial Edition, 2000, a Who Was Who and Who’s Who of the College. He received several Earhart Foundation Fellowships; taught in Tunis on a Fulbright; served on the Presidential Studies Quarterly Editorial Board; and attended many Salzburg Seminars on American Studies. He retired as Fletcher D. Proctor Emeritus of American History in 2008.
He spent many summers on Chappaquiddick Island, Edgartown, MA., many of them at his family’s Stanford White house at Green Pastures on Katama Bay. Since 2014 he spent time throughout the year at Chazy Lake in the Adirondacks.
An early member of Middlebury Town and Gown, he regularly attended the lunches, until his health faded, and he had delivered a handful of talks. He also enjoyed the Addison-Bridport Horse Thief Society. He was president of the Henry Sheldon Museum during the capital campaign that led to the Paris Fletcher Community Center; he remained a strong supporter of its Research Center with its valuable Vermont history collections and in 2021 he established the J. Robert Maguire Research Fund. He leaves unfinished a study of the late Vermonter Robert T. Stafford, former Governor, U.S. Congressman, and U.S. Senator. Early in the 21st Century he and his traveling companion, Constance Carroll, took a series of trips to Europe, ranging from France to Hungary, from Italy, Sicily, Tunisia and Malta to Russia and Finland.
His family is grateful for assistance from Addison Home, Health, and Hospice, and UVM Oncology(?). Besides his parents, he was predeceased by two older sisters and two former wives, one Eleanor T. Morison, the mother of his sons T. Beal Jacobs, Jr., and Holmes M. Jacobs who own Two Brothers Tavern in Middlebury. He had three grandchildren who he lovingly adored, Jackson, Piper and Sally Jacobs. A Memorial will be held at Saint Stephens Episcopal Church in Middlebury, VT on October 18th.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
States are ramping up efforts to get residents to switch from fossil-fuel-fired heating systems to all-electric heat pumps. Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.


Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released an 80-page action plan laying out key strategies to turbocharge heat-pump deployment. Individual states are already putting many of these tactics to the test.


California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together committed to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.


The goals are essential for addressing climate change. Buildings are directly responsible for 13% of U.S. carbon emissions, in part due to the fossil fuels burned on-site to heat indoor air and water. All-electric heat pumps can do those jobs running on clean power.


The NESCAUM action plan comes as the Trump administration clings tenaciously to fossil fuels. In recent months, the federal government has rolled back energy-efficiency standards for appliances, imposed chaotic tariffs that are raising costs for consumers, and put an early expiration date on the $2,000 federal tax credit that helps homeowners afford heat pumps.


Despite these headwinds, the report shows that ​“states are still finding creative ways to move forward,” said Emily Levin, policy and program director for NESCAUM.


HVAC heat pumps are routinely two to four times as efficient as gas furnaces, capable of heating and cooling interiors using the same physics that refrigerators employ to chill your cucumbers. Heat-pump water heaters work the same way and are three to five times as efficient as gas water heaters. By eschewing fossil fuels, these technologies improve air quality and typically save people money over the long term, even if, on average, they cost significantly more up-front than conventional heating systems. (At least one startup, though, is trying to change that.)

Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units outsold gas furnaces by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVACcategories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.


“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.


Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.



Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households. A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s Built to Last programcoordinates aid to carry out these necessary pre-electrification repairs. On the other side of the country, California is launching a program this fall to install heat pumps in qualifying low- and moderate-income homes — for free. Notably, owners of low-income multifamily buildings can also use the program to upgrade their tenants’ heating systems, but they must agree to keep rent from increasing more than 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.
Set an all-electric standard for new buildings. States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to require that most new buildings be electric only, making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.
Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures. Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. Several states and cities have already developed these rules. Maryland, for one, stipulates that owners of most edifices 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO2 emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.
Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health. For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert more than 2,600 premature deaths annually, according to electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America.
Push utilities to deliver clean heat.States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation clean-heat law doing just that. Lawmakers also mandated that utilities file their implementation plans for approval. In 2024, regulators greenlit a $440 million proposal from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 200,000 homes with heat pumps by 2030. Maryland is developing a similar standard.
Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating. Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps. Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.

NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is ​“a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.


Still, ​“I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms ​“are really going to change their customer economicsto make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”


When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. ​“You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices rise faster than inflation, the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.


NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. ​“The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. ​“Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Heat-pumps-in-Hudson.jpeg.webp,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

Without action, they warn, out-of-pocket costs could increase dramatically.","MASSACHUSETTS IS ALREADY BRACING for significant health care disruptions stemming from Republicans’ sweeping tax bill that cuts Medicaid funding, and policymakers are worried that even more residents will soon feel added strain because of federal inaction. 
A pandemic-era tax credit that has helped millions of Americans pay for health insurance is set to expire at the end of the year. Many Democrats, joined by state marketplace administrators and activists, are mounting an all-out blitz in support of extending the Biden-era aid as the threat of a federal government shutdown fast approaches. 
But Republicans who control Congress so far have not indicated they plan to extend the so-called “enhanced premium tax credits,” at least not as part of a funding bill to keep government open past September 30. That deadline might be the last, best chance for supporters to get the tax credits renewed.  
Without action, Massachusetts health care leaders and advocates warn the impacts could be dire. Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters could face higher health insurance premiums next year. Some might need to pay more than three times as much to maintain roughly the same level of coverage. State budget-writers could wind up with a quarter-billion-dollar headache, too.  
“This feels like it would be a real gut punch to working families across the state if this was to be rolled back,” said Alex Sheff, senior director of policy and government relations for the advocacy group Health Care for All. 
Officials at the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state’s health insurance marketplace, estimate that more than 337,000 residents will experience higher costs if Congress allows the credits to expire. The annual tax credit loss in Massachusetts for residents would amount to $425 million, or an average of $1,364 per person, according to a fact sheet the Connector began circulating this month as its leaders pressed for action. 
The federal tax credits not only helped Massachusetts residents afford health care, but they shifted some of the financial burden from the state, freeing up funding to expand subsidies to a larger swath of people who need help. If policymakers want to keep the lowest-cost plans available to Massachusetts consumers at roughly similar rates, they might need to kick in hundreds of millions more in state funding to make up for lost federal dollars. 
State officials have spent recent weeks notifying residents that they might lose significant subsidies, and face greater expenses, if the program sunsets. 
“Letting people know the prospect that their ability to continue to afford coverage is in question as a result of congressional inaction so far is a worrying place to be in as a marketplace,” said Connector executive director Audrey Morse Gasteier. “The clock is really ticking.” 
Sheff said without the tax credits, about 26,000 Connector members will likely see a “very dramatic” increase in their out-of-pocket costs for health coverage, and more than 300,000 others will experience “some increase in their premiums.” 
Some of the broader impacts could be a spillover. If younger, healthier people decide to drop coverage altogether because of the price increase, the remaining membership becomes, on average, older and sicker — populations that have higher insurance costs. 
“Even if you weren’t receiving a premium tax credit, your premiums are going to go up as a result of this,” Sheff said. 
The credits cap out-of-pocket premiums at up to 8.5 percent of a household’s income, depending on how much they earn. As a result, there’s a wide range of potential cost impacts that could result from the expiration depending on a family’s size, income, and other factors. 
Health policy nonprofit KFF published a calculator tool that allows users to see an estimate of what they might need to pay with and without the enhanced premium tax credits in place. 
Financial upheaval could stretch beyond consumers. Officials aim to keep ConnectorCare premiums low, and for the past four years, they’ve used the enhanced premium tax credits to offset the costs of doing so. If the credits evaporate, the state itself would need to find $255 million to keep the highly subsidized premiums at current levels. 
It’s not clear if the Legislature would support that extra funding injection at a time when budget-writers are struggling with other challenges, some inflicted by previously enacted federal funding cuts. 
The end of the enhanced tax credits would also reduce federal dollars that were partly funding a pilot program state lawmakers and Gov. Maura Healey created to make more people eligible for ConnectorCare. 
Because of the savings the tax credits afforded Massachusetts, Beacon Hill temporarily expanded eligibility for ConnectorCare, which provides low-cost health plans, from 300 percent of the federal poverty level to 500 percent, through 2026.    
But if the tax credits expire, Bay Staters in the 400 percent to 500 percent FPL bracket — equivalent to an annual income between $128,600 and $160,750 for a family of four — would no longer qualify. Morse Gasteier said that includes about 19,000 people. 
Right now, with enhanced tax credits in place, consumers in that range pay a minimum premium of $274 per month for ConnectorCare coverage. If the credits evaporate, they would need to pay at least $1,100 per month in premiums for a roughly equivalent plan with similarly low copays and cost-sharing, according to Sheff. 
He stressed it’s “unlikely” that consumers will absorb those costs. Most will instead downgrade to a lower-tier plan with less owed in monthly premiums but higher copays and deductibles. 
Sheff said even someone who shifts to a mid-tier plan might still owe premiums “more than double” what they pay for ConnectorCare. 
The credits first launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, and Congress extended them through the end of 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Millions of Americans now use the credits to offset their health insurance costs, including close to four in five Bay Staters who get coverage through the Connector. 
Hannah Frigand, Health Care for All’s senior director of help line and public programs, said she regularly receives calls from Bay Staters who are able to use savings generated by the tax credit to pay for food, rent, and other basic necessities. 
“It’s very worrisome to think about the situation that people will be in if these tax credits go away,” she said. 
Although the sunset date is the end of the year, extension supporters argue that the inflection point will arrive much sooner. 
Open enrollment begins on November 1, at which point consumers will be able to shop around and compare plans. Morse Gasteier wants resolution before then so enrollees can get a clear estimate of next year’s costs, rather than make decisions based on projected massive costs. 
“Once you lose people by presenting sticker shock to them about what their health coverage costs will be, it’s very difficult to get them back,” Morse Gasteier said.  
“Just because you could make this decision closer to December 31 doesn’t mean that there’s not damage done by people getting scared away by really high health care costs,” she added. 
Some marketplace leaders have been pushing for Congress to act by September 30 to avoid any spillover into open enrollment. 
That’s also the end of the federal fiscal year and the date by which Congress and President Trump need to agree on a funding deal to avert a government shutdown. 
The credits appear to be a sticking point in increasingly tense talks in Washington, DC. 
US Rep. Lori Trahan said she and fellow Democrats plan to use the government funding debate as leverage to push Republicans, who narrowly control both branches of Congress, to extend the tax credits. 
“We’ve made it very clear that the Republicans need Democratic votes in order to pass a [continuing resolution] and their appropriations bills, and we aren’t going to stand for ripping health care away from millions of people and rubber-stamp a budget that does that,” Trahan told CommonWealth Beacon. 
GOP leaders have suggested Congress can wait until after the end-of-month deadline to decide the fate of the enhanced credits. 
“I think that we are open to the conversation about what we do with the Obamacare premium tax credits,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier this month, according to NBC News. “That’s something in which members, Republican senators and I think, for that matter, Republican House members have an interest, as well, but this isn’t the place to do that.” 
Some congressional Republicans have suggested any potential agreement on extending the aid should consider reforms to the program to prevent “fraud,” Axios reported. 
Healey and 17 other governors, all Democrats, wrote to congressional leaders last week urging prompt action to extend the tax credits, calling it “one of the simplest, most effective steps Congress can take to keep health care affordable.” 
“If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for health care, rent, or groceries,” they wrote. “Hard-working American families, older Americans not yet on Medicare, small business owners, and rural communities — where marketplace coverage is often the only option —  will be hit the hardest.” 
Even if Congress winds up embracing the program, leaders at the Connector are bracing for a challenging open enrollment period marked by disruption. 
The federal reconciliation package sometimes referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” dramatically overhauled health care spending and eligibility. Altogether, the new law could force about 80,000 Connector members — about one-quarter of the current pool — to lose coverage, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. 
“This,” Morse Gasteier said, “is really the most complicated open enrollment period we’ve prepared for probably in a decade.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Massachusetts-General-Hospital-2-2-1-edited.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

At the state Capitol this year, lawmakers, policy experts, housing advocates and others said the term “housing shortage” at least 30 times in committee hearings and floor speeches — underscoring how California’s housing crisis remains one of the state’s top issues.
But what exactly is a housing shortage, and how bad is it in California? The answer depends on who you ask, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
One analyst told Ben that a housing shortage is “the gap between the housing you have and the housing you need.” But calculating the “housing you need” is based on various factors that not everyone agrees on.
This has led to estimates on California’s housing crunch ranging between a mere 56,000 units to as much as 8.2 million.
A decade ago, in one of the first attempts to put a hard number to the state’s housing problem, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office calculated that California would have had to construct 2.7 million additional units over the prior 30 years to keep the state’s housing cost inflation on par with the rest of the U.S.
A year later, consulting firm McKinsey & Company reported that it would take 3.5 million homes to close California’s housing gap — a figure then-Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom used when he campaigned for governor, pledging to build that many units by 2025. (Spoiler alert: That didn’t happen.)
Despite the imperfect science, Daniel McCue of Harvard University said that it’s worth noting that the general consensus around California’s housing crisis is that it’s huge.

McCue, a researcher at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies: “Whether it’s one-and-a-half million or five-and-a-half million, these are big numbers. … There’s so much to do. There’s so far to go.”

How effective were these resentencing policies?

A recidivism analysis on California’s resentencing policies implemented over the last decade sheds new light on the effectiveness of the state’s efforts to reshape its criminal justice system and reduce its prison population, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich. 
The report, released Wednesday, details recidivism rates for five notable resentencing policies that were implemented under Govs. Jerry Brown and Newsom from 2012 and 2022. Under all five policies, about 12,000 people were resentenced and 9,500 were released, with Black and Latino people making up the majority of those released.
It’s important to note that the report includes one-year recidivism outcomes. The standard timeline to determine recidivism is three years, which only two of the five policies are old enough to measure.
The state agency’s legal director says the report shows how the policies are successful for decreasing the prison population without increasing risks to the public. But some district attorneys critical of the agency argue that the policies harm victims, law enforcement and public safety.

St. Louis University’s PRiME Center, a nonpartisan education think tank, held a half-day conference on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia Thursday to dig into how the state calculates academic growth and celebrate high-growth districts.
“We are really interested in schools that are moving kids the most,” PRiME executive director Collin Hitt told reporters. “We want to do better than we are.”
Hitt believes Missouri has the best formula for calculating academic growth, and the data generated by the formula can help the state identify the best teaching practices.
“You would not be able to see the impact (educators) have on students if we didn’t have growth,” he said.
Education Commissioner Karla Eslinger told conference attendees that growth sees beyond standardized test scores.
“We all have standards, and we want all our kids to meet those standards,” she said. “But one of the things we truly have to pay attention to is the progress they are making towards those standards.”
Missouri’s growth model shows educators how much learning their students accomplished in the school year relative to others in the state. A score of zero doesn’t mean a child has not learned anything but instead indicates that their growth was average.
The formula’s architect Eric Parsons, an economics professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said growth is a “more equitable” accountability measure than tracking average test scores. Districts with high achievement levels tend to be wealthier, but high growth is seen in all areas of the state and all socioeconomic levels.
When Parsons graphed growth levels against poverty, there was no correlation. Overall achievement, though, largely increased alongside wealth.
Data also showed no correlation between achievement levels and growth scores, meaning that expanding students’ knowledge is as hard for low-achieving schools as it is for high achievers.
Parsons received an influx of questions about the formula following the state’s transition to a new accountability model three years ago. Growth was once a small factor in schools’ report cards but now accounts for a quarter of their scores.
Administrators speaking at the conference said questions have not completely disappeared but are now primarily concerned with how growth scores are translated into the school accountability points system.
“Districts are wondering how (education officials) are applying the growth model, which is obviously a great model, into those growth points because it does cause some confusion,” Gainesville R-5 School District Superintendent Justin Gilmore said during a panel discussion. “We need to dig deeper into how the growth model is being utilized by the department.”

Now in long-term recovery, Denson on Thursday helped distribute naloxone, a life-saving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. She thinks that if the people she was around back then had had some doses available, they could’ve brought her breathing back.
“They might have rather used this than immorally just leaving me like I was at the time,” she said.
On Thursday, volunteers across Mississippi distributed free boxes of naloxone during Save a Life Day in an effort to combat stigma. 
Denson is the operations coordinator for Grace House, a recovery residence for women in Hinds County. She is also a peer navigator for Mississippi Harm Reduction Initiative and one of the Hinds County organizers for Save a Life Day. She and a crew of volunteers handed out naloxone, fentanyl testing strips, free pizza and other resources outside of St Luke’s United Methodist Church in Jackson.

One volunteer was Glen Watt, who is in recovery and originally from Crystal Springs. He offered to help because he wanted to give back to the community. 
“It’s an ongoing epidemic. It’s not just something you sweep under the rug,” he said.
From his experience, many people in Mississippi don’t know about naloxone. He said he used to be in that group. Watt said someone in his family still struggles with addiction, and he hoped to take some naloxone to them.
In Rankin County, Pearl resident Emilee Shell planned to distribute naloxone, drug test strips and more. 
Shell is the Save a Life Day county organizer for Rankin County, programs director for Mississippi Impact Coalition and director of Grace House. She is in long-term recovery. She used to work at a treatment center and said she has lost several loved ones to overdoses. 
Though she was not participating on behalf of the Mississippi Impact Coalition, she said Save a Life Day aligns with her organization’s mission. 
“Oftentimes, our communities are left without support or resources. So carrying naloxone and offering harm reduction, it’s not just public health,” she said. “We believe it’s public love.”

Originating in West Virginia, Save a Life Day is a national effort created by community organization SOAR WV. In Mississippi, an estimated 30 volunteers across 10 counties intended to distribute at least 500 kits. 
Jason McCarty is the other county organizer for Hinds County, as well as a state co-coordinator with Denson. McCarty is the program development strategist for United Way of the Capital Area and for years has been advocating for those impacted by the opioid crisis. He said he sees naloxone as a tool for saving lives and helping people recover from addiction.
“We cannot get people into treatment and into a recovery life if they are dead,” he said.
Distributing naloxone kits is a popular form of harm reduction, a set of strategies and practices aimed at reducing harm to those who abuse drugs. It does not treat drug addiction as a moral failing and seeks to reduce stigma, increase education, save lives and support communities. 
Naloxone, or narcan, temporarily reverses an opioid overdose. The drug wears off after 30 to 90 minutes, so someone who receives a dose needs to be monitored and get immediate medical attention. It is harmless to people who aren’t on opioids. 
The Mississippi State Department of Health’s website has more information on how to help someone who is overdosing and how to order naloxone. 
In 2024, 68% of all suspected overdose deaths in Mississippi were opioid-related. That was down from about 77% in 2023. More than  4,600 non-fatal overdoses have occurred in Mississippi in the first six months of 2025, according to the state health department. 
Emergency medical service members across Mississippi administered naloxone 2,655 times in 2024. In Hinds County, it was 257, one of the highest numbers in the state. Rankin County had 113.
At Tuesday’s Jackson City Council meeting, Mayor John Horhn declared Thursday as Save a Life Day in the city. The council also voted to enter an agreement between the city and United Way of the Capital Area to place and maintain a “Leave Behind” narcan box inside the Warren Hood Building near City Hall. It won’t be paid for with the city’s opioid settlement money.
This proclamation came a day after Horhn said Jackson planned to use future opioid settlement funds for violence prevention. He said it was possible some of the money could go toward preventing drug deaths. 
A Mississippi Today investigation found that Jackson spent $117,734 of the $546,664 it received on moving offices, installing fiber optic cables and a new shelving system.

At the council meeting, McCarty thanked the mayor and council members for their help, but implored the city to spend opioid settlement funds on overdose prevention. He said 10,000 Mississippians have died because of opioids since 1999.
“This opioid settlement money was for them,” he told the council members. “Please, we need to spend this money on opioid prevention, and the United Way of the Capital Area is here to help you do that.”
Horhn did not directly address the settlement funds at that meeting, but did “urge all citizens to participate in activities that support overdose prevention, increase awareness and promote the use of naloxone to save lives.”

Save a Life Day volunteers also faced pushback from those who see distributing naloxone as enabling drug addiction. 
Shell said an employee at Pearl City Hall who handles special event permits was “giving me a hard time.” 
“She disclosed that she was not a fan of the idea or narcan distribution. She questioned where I got the narcan and if it was legitimately from a pharmacy,” Shell said. “She acted as if I was trying to distribute drugs to the community and completely disregarded the fact that it is a harm reduction tool to actually save lives.”
Shell also said that when she called Pearl Police Chief Nick McLendon to ask about permits, he said that while he supported her efforts, the police department would not be partnering with her because he didn’t want the community to think they were supporting illegal drug use. 
McCarty said he requested a meeting with Pearl’s mayor and police chief to do stigma education for the mayor’s staff.
Mississippi Today reached out to McLendon, the employee in question and the Pearl’s mayor’s office. Neither the employee nor the mayor’s office responded in time for publication.
The police chief confirmed his response.
“Our police department has it, our firemen have it. We use it to save lives, but at the same time I’m not going to go publicly encourage illicit drug use,” McLendon said. He said he did not know of any meeting that was requested with him and the mayor.

Denson said that she heard from other volunteers who got pushback from people in authority.
“I know that there have been a few times where we have tried to look for locations, not in Jackson specifically, but … just the feedback from them, saying a representative of their town is saying that they don’t want to draw that image to them,” Denson said.
Shell compared the stigma that comes with addiction to a grey cloud hanging overhead. 
“Whether you’re in recovery or not, people only want to remember what you used to be and not what you’re trying to do today,” Shell said.
Despite the challenges, Denson said she is committed to helping others.
“I don’t fault anybody for not knowing it, but I think there’s a proper time and place for everything, and I’m just honored to be the one to be able to educate somebody or share my experience,” said Denson.
“I don’t want this to sound negative, but I think narcan should be like that change that is left in your cupholder,” she said. “You never know when you need it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25153443/Save-a-Life-Day-2-1.jpg,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

California can change that,Mark González,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/physical-therapy-california-insurers/,A bill awaiting Gov.

Mark González
Assemblymember Mark González, a Los Angeles Democrat, represents California’s 54th Assembly District.
.


My mom is no stranger to hardship. She raised me as a single mother working long hours, living paycheck to paycheck, while facing the loss of three sons — one to drowning, one to an aneurysm and one to an epileptic seizure. 
She turned her grief into strength and taught me what resilience looks like, even when it feels like the world is against you.
When she had a stroke two years ago, that lesson came full circle. I became her caregiver, her voice pushing her health plan to approve the care she needed. 
Even with good insurance, we had to fight arbitrary prior authorization requirements just to get her into physical therapy. Then every two sessions we had to beg and wait for approval for the next two. 
Recovery doesn’t happen in two-visit increments. It happens when patients have timely, uninterrupted access. That was my inspiration for Assembly Bill 574, which would end insurers’ vague prior authorization requirements and guarantee patients up to 12 physical therapy visits before health plans can delay or deny care. 
Research shows about 90% of patients need at least that many visits to make real progress. But when patients are forced to wait, they don’t just lose time — they lose strength and hope, and they face higher medical costs down the road.Physical therapists are the unsung heroes of recovery. They are there when a stroke survivor takes their first steps, when a new mother struggles through postpartum pain, when someone with Parkinson’s learns new ways to stay independent, and when an athlete fights to get back on the field. 
We cannot let red tape from insurance companies get in their way. Maine and Indiana have already passed similar laws. It’s California’s turn.
Some health plans argue AB 574 will increase costs. They’re wrong. Early, reliable access to physical therapy reduces health care costs by as much as 75% by preventing complications and avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations or reliance on painkillers. 
My mother’s journey taught me how fragile life is, but also how powerful it can be when patients get the right care at the right time. I saw her strength — not just physical, but spiritual — return little by little with every session. Her therapists didn’t just help her move again; they gave her hope that she would once again cook her favorite meals, dance at family gatherings and live with dignity. 
Her story is not unique. Families across California are facing the same fight every day. AB 574, which awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, can give them a fair shot at recovery, letting families focus on healing instead of hurdles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092525-Physical-Therapy-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

56,000. 2.7 million. 840,000. Why is one of California’s most pressing policy problems so hard to measure? 


Imagine you’ve finally taken your car to the mechanic to investigate that mysterious warning light that’s been flashing on your dashboard for the past week and a half.
The mechanic informs you that your car’s brake fluid is too low. Dangerously low. Your brake fluid supply, he says, has reached “crisis” levels, which sounds both scary and very expensive. 
Naturally, you would prefer that your car have a non-critical amount of brake fluid. “How much more do I need?” you ask.
“A quart,” the mechanic responds. “No, actually, three quarts. Or maybe seven gallons — but only routed to your rear brakes. Actually, let’s settle on half an ounce.”
Such is the situation with California’s housing shortage.
For nearly a decade now, the Legislature has been churning out bills, Attorney General Rob Bonta has been filing lawsuits and Gov. Gavin Newsom has been revamping agencies, dashing off executive orders and quoting Ezra Klein with the explicit goal of easing the state’s chronic undersupply of places to live.
California simply doesn’t have enough housing and this shortage is the leading cause of our housing affordability concerns — virtually everyone in and around the state government, along with the vast majority of academics who have studied the issue, seems now to agree on this point.
This consensus was on display this year when lawmakers passed two sweeping changes to state housing law, one that shields apartment developments from environmental litigation and the other that would permit denser development near major public transit stops in big cities. Both were legislative non-starters just a few years ago. These days even the opponents of these bills have accepted the premise that the state faces a “housing shortage,” a term evoked at least 30 times in committee hearings and floor speeches this year.
Now, if only anyone could agree on how big the housing shortage actually is. 

Plenty of people have tried to put a number on the problem.
In 2015, the Legislative Analyst’s Office, which serves as a policy analysis shop and think tank for the Legislature, took an early crack at quantifying the state’s shortage by calculating how many additional units major metro areas would have had to build over the prior three decades to keep housing cost inflation on par with that of the rest of the country.  
It came up with 2.7 million missing units.
A year later, consulting giant McKinsey one-upped the LAO, putting the state’s “housing shortfall” at 3.5 million houses, apartments and condos, a number Newsom campaigned on. 
Not all estimates hit seven digits. In 2024, the housing policy nonprofit Up For Growth published the more modest estimated shortfall of 840,000 units, which comes pretty close to the 820,000 Freddie Mac put forward a few years earlier.
California Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing, has counted the deficit at 1.3 million units — but not just any units. That’s how many homes the state needs to add that are affordable to people making under a certain income. 
Then, this summer, a group of housing analysts including an economist at Moody’s Analytics, came up with the strikingly low figure of just 56,000 — though the authors acknowledged that it’s probably an underestimate.
Estimates of the nation’s overall housing supply are similarly all over the place: From as high as 8.2 million to 1.5 million (and, in one controversial paper, zero). 
What even is a housing shortage?
The concept of a “housing shortage” is, in theory, pretty simple, said Anjali Kolachalam, an analyst at Up For Growth. 
“It’s basically just the gap between the housing you have and the housing you need,” she said. 
In practice, defining and then setting out to quantify the “housing you need” is an exercise fraught with messy data, guestimation and an inconvenient need for judgement calls. 
Most estimates begin with a target vacancy rate. In any reasonably well-functioning housing market, the logic goes, some houses and apartments sit empty, either because they’re between renters, they’ve just been built or sold, they’re being fixed or renovated or they’re someone’s second home. A modest vacancy rate is what allows you to pull up Zillow or Craigslist and not get a “No Results Found” error. A very low one suggests there aren’t enough homes to go around.
But choosing a “healthy” vacancy rate — one that reflects a functional housing market — and then backing out the number of additional homes needed to hit it, is more art than science. Most estimates turn to historical data to find some level when supply and demand weren’t completely out of whack. Whether that halcyon period of relative affordability is 2015 or 2006 or 2000 or 1980 varies by researcher and, likely, by the region being considered.
“This notion of ‘pent up demand’ is necessarily in an economist’s judgment call.”Elena Patel, fellow, Brookings Institution
Beyond that, many researchers have tried to put a value on what is sometimes called “pent up” demand or “missing households.” Those are all the people who would have gone off and gotten their own apartment or bought their own place, but, because of the unavailability of affordable places to live, have opted to keep living with housemates, with parents or, in more extreme cases, without shelter of any kind.
Absent a survey of every living person, there’s no way to precisely measure how many people fall into this camp. 
“This notion of ‘pent up demand’ is necessarily in an economist’s judgment call,” said Elena Patel, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped put together a nationwide shortage estimate last year (4.9 million). 
These variations in methods help explain some of the differences in the shortage estimates. Other differences pop-up thanks to the vagaries of data. 
The Moody’s Analytics-led report, for example, calculated a national shortage of roughly 2 million units by adding together both the number of new units needed to raise the overall vacancy rate and the homes needed to backfill their measure of “pent up” demand. But for its California-specific estimate, the data wasn’t available to do the latter, potentially leaving out a big chunk of the statewide shortage. 
Then some estimates differ because the analysts are defining the shortage in a completely different way. 
The California Housing Partnership looks at the difference between the number of households deemed by federal housing guidelines to have “very” or “extremely” low incomes and the number of units that those households could conceivably rent with less than 30% of their incomes. 
That gap of 1.3 million gets at a problem totally distinct from an overall shortage of homes. 
Finally, there’s the question of scale. Housing markets are, on the whole, local. A national shortage is going to add together San Francisco and Detroit, masking the extremes of both. A shortage estimate for a state as large and diverse as California may have the same problem.
“It is like looking for a weather forecast for a trip to the beach and being told that the average temperature nationwide is likely to be 67 degrees,” the authors of the Moody’s-led analysis wrote.
Why estimate a shortage?
What might be more valuable than fixating on any one shortage estimate, said Daniel McCue, a researcher at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, is to look at all the estimates together and appreciate that, by and large, they’re all huge.
“Whether it’s one-and-a-half million or five-and-a-half million, these are big numbers,” he said. That leads to an inescapable takeaway, he said. “There’s so much to do. There’s so far to go.”
Patel, from Brookings, said trying to put a precise tally on what is ultimately the somewhat nebulous concept of a “housing shortage” is still a worthwhile exercise because it gives lawmakers and planners a benchmark against which to measure progress. 
How much additional taxpayer money should a state throw at affordable housing development? How aggressive should a locality be in pursuing changes to local zoning? “The more concrete you can be in policy making land, the better,” she said.
The State of California does in fact have its own set of concrete numbers.
Every eight years, the Department of Housing and Community Development issues planning goals to regions across the state — a number of additional homes, broken down by affordability level, that every municipality should plan for. These are, effectively, California government’s official estimates of the state shortage.
To cobble together these numbers, state regulators look at projections of population growth to accommodate the need for future homes and then tack on adjustments to account for all the homes that weren’t built in prior periods, but perhaps ought to have been. If a region has an excess number of households deemed overcrowded, it gets more units. If vacancy rates are below a predetermined level, it gets more units. If there is a bevy of people spending more than 30% of their incomes on rent, more (affordable) units. 
It’s a process that the state regulators have come to take somewhat more seriously in recent years, engendering an ongoing political backlash from density-averse local governments and neighborhood activists. 
In the state’s last estimate, the topline total was 2.5 million units. 
This coming cycle, which has already begun in the rural north and will slowly roll out across the state in the coming years, will produce yet another number. That will be one more estimate for state lawmakers of how much brake fluid the car needs.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/071223_San-Francisco_SN_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The rate of Louisiana K-12 students missing school without an excuse has remained higher than average since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana. 
Over the past 11 years, the statewide truancy rate has averaged 36%. But since the 2020-21 school year, it has been consistently over 40%, according to the report. 
Louisiana defines truancy as having unexcused absences for five or more school days per semester. 
The state may have a lower chronic absenteeism rate than other states, however, when using the U.S. Department of Education definition. The federal government defines chronic absenteeism as enrolled students who miss 10% of their school days with unexcused absences. 
Chronic absenteeism nationwide is at 23%, but in Louisiana, it stands at just 22.5%, according to data from FutureEd. 
Chronic truancy varies greatly from parish to parish as calculated by the state. The highest rates for 2023-24 were in Tensas (67.5%), Point Coupee (66%), St. Bernard (61.8%) and St. Landry (61.1%). The lowest were Ascension (20.6%), Red River (23.6%), East Carroll (24.1%) and St. James (24.5%). 
High rates of unexcused absences put students more at risk of becoming a school dropout and substance abuse, according to the report.

Hatch United States Courthouse is pictured in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, May 7, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Months after Utah’s ban on flavored vapes, Blackhouse, a former Sugar House vape shop, became a sanctuary and a safe haven for those searching to get flavored cartridges — for spiritual and religious practices. 
The electronic cigarettes joined other sacraments that have been at the center of religious legal challenges in the state like psychedelic mushrooms and cannabis. But, after Utah law enforcement agencies raided the Sugar House location, as well as the Salt City Sanctuary in South Salt Lake in August, all of these sacraments have been put into legal question, with the Sugarleaf Church, the institution overseeing both sanctuaries, initiating a lawsuit to keep them.
“Officers arrived using riot gear, AR-15s, pry bars, and battering rams, forcibly entered both sanctuaries, and immediately began disabling the security systems and surveillance cameras with a crow bar,” the church said in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City in August.

During the raids officers confiscated cannabis and psilocybin products, which the church called “sacramental property,” as well as thousands of flavored vape cartridges, blank checkbooks, waivers, clergy rosters, cash donations, tablets and membership records.
The church is asking a judge to order law enforcement to stop interfering with members’ free exercise of religion and to award compensatory damages. The institution is also asking the South Salt Lake Police Department and the Utah State Bureau of Investigation to undergo mandatory religious sensitivity training and for the immediate return of property.
At Salt City Sanctuary the agents seized “4.24 kilograms of packaged marijuana flower; over a kilogram of ‘fresh flower’ marijuana; 956 1-gram pre-rolled marijuana joints, 8 display jars of marijuana flower, 152.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, mushroom gummies and sample packs, numerous edibles with THC, and rolling papers,” according to a motion to dismiss filed by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office.
With House split on whether to keep ban on flavored vape sales, status quo remains

At Blackhouse, officers confiscated “significant quantities of raw marijuana; psilocybin mushrooms; THC vapes, cookies, gummies, candies, syrups, oils, and similar products; psilocybin cookies, gummies, and similar products; and over 3,000 flavored vape cartridges and order receipts,” the district attorney’s office said in its motion.
Joshua Robers, a church reverend, was also arrested and booked into Salt Lake County Jail during the Salt City Sanctuary raid. He faces multiple charges in 3rd District Court, including possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a third-degree felony. 
The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit this month and declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing. 
The church
The Sugarleaf Church is a non-denominational church with branches in nine states and Mexico that uses psychoactive substances for sacraments, including cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms. Members have to sign an agreement committing to following the church’s code of conduct.
“These are not casual practices,” the church wrote in its lawsuit, “they are intentional, structured, and rooted in decades of education, experience and legal precedent.”
Judge sides with faith group over Utah county in psychedelic mushroom religious freedom lawsuit

The church cited protections under the U.S. Constitution and federal law that guards religious freedom in the filing. It also mentioned a federal judge’s recent decision siding with a small Provo-based faith group that uses psilocybin mushrooms as part of its practice and ordering Utah County to temporarily stop criminal proceedings against the organization and its founder. 
The Provo case partially hinged on a 2024 state law that made it easier to sue government entities if they restrict a person’s right to exercise their religion. 
The Sugarleaf raids came a day after that decision, the church said. According to a sanctuary volunteer’s statement, officers refused to read waivers, doctrinal statements and clergy notices. They also “mocked the religious affiliation.”
“One officer openly referred to the religious operation as a ‘loophole’ and laughed when corrected. He also said ‘look how stupid they are, they wrote it all down,’” the church’s lawsuit says.
However, prosecutors argue the Utah sites are best defined as shops and not churches, since Department of Commerce records indicate that multiple business entities were operating at the same location as Blackhouse Sanctuary, including Blackhouse Vapor Company LLC. That fact, the prosecutors wrote, rebuts the claims that the activities at the Sugar House location were solely religious.
The District Attorney’s Office also pointed out that “plaintiffs assert religious use of marijuana and psilocybin; they do not assert any religious belief or practice relating to flavored vape cartridges.”

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.
But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice. 
The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles — the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s. 
“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”
In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.
The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners. 
Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.
“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”
This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs. 
“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away — whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community — dubbed New Isle — could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass. 
What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years. 
Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan — paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill — designed to shore up the coastline.
And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them. 
In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way — and “limited” funds to do so. 
Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.
In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction — and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds. 
Relocation causes rift
Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.
“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”
It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state. 
Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders. 
“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”
But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials — despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk — “were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders,  who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. 
Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s Office of Community Development, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”
McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.
“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”
Louisiana: Leader in severe flood risk
Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years. 
Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration. 
Louisiana’s coast contains 40% of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms. 
For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it. 
The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.
Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area. 
But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”
CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”
Owners report leaking doors, broken appliances
The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities. 
“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mph winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters,  the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.
One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.
Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned. 
And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs. 
“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”
She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all.  They just washed their hands of us.” 
Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it. 
“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”
In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-driven relocation touted
University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.
“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”
Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise. 
They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.” 
Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline: 

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.
If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.
All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.
All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.
“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

‘This conversation is hardly happening’
Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning. 
When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”
“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”
Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.  
For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!” 
Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.
There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive? 
“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”
At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started. 
But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office. 
Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response. 
“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High insurance costs driving coastal retreat
And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners — yet — the cost of insurance might be.
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out. 
“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now. 
Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can — or should — stay.
“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.” 
Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable. 
“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.” 
“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

Susie Lee said Thursday. “This is a choice that Republicans are making. They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency.” (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)U.S. Rep. Susie Lee on Thursday said she and her Democratic colleagues are working to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire this year, and if an impasse on the issue results in a federal government shutdown it will be the fault of Republicans.
Lee spoke alongside medical professionals from Southern Hills Hospital in Las Vegas to highlight the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies enacted under the Biden administration. Lee’s comments come days before a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a budget bill that keeps the federal government operating.
“This is not a choice that Democrats are making,” Lee responded when asked if preserving the tax credits is worth shutting the government down. “This is a choice that Republicans are making. They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency.”
She added, “I think that Americans have made it clear that they value their health care and they value having access to health insurance, and I think it’s worth fighting for.”
An estimated 85,000 Nevadans are expected to lose their subsidy, according to Keep Americans Covered, a coalition of health care providers, insurers, and customers.
Nearly 9 out of 10 people who get insurance through Nevada HealthLink, the state’s ACA portal, receive a federal subsidy that lowers the cost of their premiums, according to the organization.Lee argued that Congress needs to act on the issue now because Oct. 1 is when most insurance companies set rates for the upcoming year. Americans will feel the impact of higher premiums and the lack of a tax credit that brings down their premium almost immediately.
Lee said Democrats are scheduled to return to Washington DC on Monday and “stand ready to negotiate.” But she acknowledged that negotiation is only possible when the other party participates.
“The Republicans aren’t going back to Washington on Monday like the Democrats,” she added.
On Thursday, Trump canceled a scheduled meeting with Democratic leaders, leading many to see a shutdown as highly likely. The White House Thursday also sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs. 
Lee said Republicans must “stand up with” Democrats and do what Congress has done since the Constitution was ratified in 1789, assert its Congress’s constitutional authority.
“I have had Republicans in private say to me, ‘We need to reassert our power of the purse,’” said Lee. “I’m standing up. They need to stand up in public too. That’s really what this is going to come down to. At what point are they going to side with the American people over the corruption of this president?”
Lee said she has already introduced a bipartisan bill to address the expiring subsidies. She described it as “a stop gap.”
“What we really want is for these tax credits to be permanent,” she said. “In the big bill, tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans have been made permanent. Let’s make these tax credits permanent as well.”
She continued, “If we can’t get there, my bill just says ‘let’s extend them for one more year and we’ll negotiate in a year.’”
ACA plan premiums are already expected to rise by 17.5% in Nevada next year, something Lee ascribes to “all the other stuff” that was in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Insurers have cited the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits and the impact of tariffs as reasons for the skyrocketing premiums,hike, according to KFF.
The end result is that some families in Nevada could pay upwards of 200% more, according to Keep Americans Covered.
A 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year would see their premium increase by more than $12,000 for the year, while a family of four with an income of $64,000 would see an increase of more than $2,500.
“These are debilitating increases,” Lee said.
Lee, as she has in the past, emphasized that rising premiums for Americans with health insurance secured through the ACA will affect people who secure their insurance through their employer or other means.
“You’re going to see our uninsured population increase probably back to what we were before, which was over 20% in our state,” she said. “As a result of that, they will go to access care at a hospital like Southern Hills at the emergency room. And then, as a result, we all pay. Our insurance premiums will all go up.”
Dr. Mark Glyman, the chief of surgery at Southern Hills Hospital, said the loss of the tax credits will devastate rural hospitals: “They will disappear and that will have a chain reaction on the bigger hospitals.”
Rural patients will have to travel to the bigger hospitals, putting additional pressure on those systems, which are already dealing with issues like worker shortages.
“Even a large hospital like Sunrise, which operates at a loss, will not be able to survive this,” he added.
Defending the ACA
Lee noted that 1 in 10 ACA enrollees are children, and 1 in 4 are between the ages of 50 to 64.
“They don’t qualify for Medicare,” she said of the latter group. “They tend to get higher rates because they’re a little older, a little less healthy.”
Lee recalled a pre-ACA medical crisis that could have bankrupted her own parents. Her mother, shortly before turning 65 and becoming eligible for Medicare, had a major heart attack and spent a month in the hospital.
At the time, their preexisting conditions meant they could not afford insurance. Lee said her mom’s hospital stay resulted in a medical bill “that was basically the value of her home.”
The family was lucky to get onto a payment plan and not lose their home, she said.
Glyman shared a similar personal story, recalling a loved one who, three years ago, spent six months in the hospital with covid. He said her recovery was their family’s top priority, but that in the back of his mind he knew they were at risk of losing everything financially.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, keeping the family member alive cost $75,000 per day on top of other hospital costs. She was on it for two months.
Eventually, she made a full recovery.
Real people are behind the premiums, he argued.
“The people we’re taking care of are not strangers,” he said. “They are our parents. They’re our children. They’re our neighbors.”
He added later, “Health care is more than science. It’s humanity. It’s compassion. And it is us. Nobody in Nevada should feel abandoned. Nobody. … Nobody should have to come to the hospital and worry about the fact they’re going to be bankrupt.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SusieLeeSouthernHills-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-26 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"What CT hospitals, health centers want from federal rural grant",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/26/ct-rural-health-transformation-program/,"CT could get at least $500 million over the next five years, starting in 2026. The grant was part of President Trump’s 'big beautiful bill.'","Connecticut officials are hoping the state is allotted a piece of a $50 billion federal grant to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state.
Rural hospitals and health clinics across the U.S. are facing an especially fraught time amid reports of closures, fears of impending Medicaid cuts and financial instability. And they face unique challenges when it comes to access and affordability.
Some of those same barriers exist in the rural pockets of Connecticut, whether it’s around the ability of a patient to physically get to an appointment or more specialized services or workforce shortages around things like primary care.
The Rural Health Transformation Program fund was added in President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” amid growing concerns around Medicaid cuts in the same legislation.
Connecticut state agencies are sourcing ideas that range from workforce development, IT infrastructure, innovation and access to care that are even more burdensome for rural regions compared to their more urban counterparts.
Community health centers and hospitals across Connecticut are cautiously optimistic about the federal funding, which is overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That funding stream comes at an uncertain time for many of these clinics and hospitals as they brace for major health care shakeups in the coming years.
“The fact that there is a grant that came out to help support rural health providers is a large step in the right direction as we continue to face these challenges ahead of us, layered on top of a rural geography where we have some additional unique challenges, just by the nature of where we provide services,” said Joanne Borduas, the CEO of the Community Health & Wellness Center of Greater Torrington.
Officials at the Connecticut Department of Social Services and the Office of Policy and Management are taking the lead on the grant application and working with several other state agencies. They’ve been speaking with other health officials about the application, and a public comment period runs until Oct. 3.
But officials didn’t have time to dither. The process opened in mid-September, and applications are due by Nov. 5. Awards will be decided by the end of the year, and states will start to see that funding in early 2026.
Connecticut’s priorities center around “interventions with long-term benefits” for rural residents and “long-term scalability and financial sustainability,” meaning once the federal funding dries up after 2030, the programs should be able to continue. They hope whatever funding approval they get will have longevity and not need to rely on additional resources from either the federal government or the state.
Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided between the states. If Connecticut’s application is approved, the state would get $500 million over five years. 
The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of CMS and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors “the administrator determines appropriate.” 
Some in Connecticut don’t feel as optimistic about getting anything from that pot of money because the state is less rural than those in the Midwest, but they still hope the creativity of their application helps boost their chances for additional funding beyond the anticipated $500 million.
“We look different than Wyoming, so the solution in the Northeast is going to be different,” Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, said.
The program’s funding would cover only about a third of the expected cuts to federal Medicaid spending in rural communities, according to a KFF analysis. But the purpose of the grant isn’t meant to deal with holes in reimbursement rates for Medicaid.
“A couple of things that the transformation funds are not intended to do is offset voids of reimbursement for services that are already being reimbursed under either federal or commercial payments. But the focus of the application really needs to resolve around some central themes,” said Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Health. For Connecticut, he sees priorities like access to care and workforce development.
But much of the funding that Connecticut could receive would come before Medicaid reforms are fully implemented, and it’s unclear how much it would actually cushion the blow of steep cuts. New work requirements and changes to the provider tax, which help states maximize federal Medicaid grants, won’t go into effect until 2028 at the earliest — and possibly a couple of years later.
Overall, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimates that the “big beautiful bill” would lead to a reduction of nearly $1 trillion over the course of a decade in federal Medicaid spending. For those in rural areas, Medicaid spending could drop by $155 billion over that same period.
That’s on top of the additional changes to health insurance and expiring enhanced premium subsidies for those enrolled in commercial plans through the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT.
But the Trump administration believes the new program will ultimately help rural communities improve access to care, even if they have adequate insurance.
“This program’s major focus is to deal with the folks who are most vulnerable in rural America, because for them, having insurance isn’t the big challenge, usually. It’s getting access to care,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said on a call with reporters last week. “You might have perfectly good health insurance if you’re a retired vet, but you can’t get mental health care practitioners where you live.”
Rural hospitals
Rural hospitals are already struggling throughout the country, and Connecticut is no exception.
Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, in the northeast corner of the state, is an independently owned community hospital and has had its share of financial challenges. The state-owned University of Connecticut Health Center is exploring the purchase of three hospitals in the state including Day Kimball.
“Our area is truly rural and geographically distant from other facilities, and that remoteness is compounded by the fact that while there may be some hospitals a little bit north of us that are closer, it’s complicated by the fact that you’ve got a state border which doesn’t necessarily allow all of your population to get there,” said Kramer of Day Kimball.
Medicaid reimbursement rates have been particular stressors for many of them. Kramer said they lose about 40 cents on the dollar to provide care for patients on Medicaid.
Kramer said he’d like to address the issue of scarcity, particularly among primary care physicians, with not as many licensed professionals moving to rural regions.
“Creating mechanisms for getting more primary care into rural regions is an important aspect of health maintenance, largely because the earlier we’re able to get people into seeing a primary care physician, the more likely we are to identify potential for longer term health risk, and we’re able to manage against that so that potentially we avoid disease progression to the point where it becomes hyper-acute,” Kramer said.
And with shortages and recruitment issues similar to those in many other industries, health care officials are thinking about ways they can entice more physicians and medical school graduates to rural facilities for longer stays. Some of those options include programs that would bring those in medical residencies or fellowships into rural areas.
Kramer said many students are going to medical school and other training programs that largely exist in urban areas, making them more likely to stay in the area where they practice.
With cutbacks to Medicaid likely in the near future, hospitals could become overloaded. Rural providers see many government-insured individuals. If some of those patients fall off the rolls, hospitals expect to treat more people who are uninsured as a direct result of the “big beautiful bill,” also known as H.R. 1.
“I think it’s reasonable to say, then, some of the dollars created in H.R. 1 to support health care delivery in rural America and the network of providers that requires should go to hospitals. I think we have the expertise to do it, but we’re also going to be feeling the ultimate effects of the policy,” Kidwell of CT Hospital Association said.

Community health centers
Federally qualified health centers have also gone through their fair share of turmoil in recent months. They were affected by the freeze of federal funds and, even when those were restored, they still faced some temporary delays to be able to draw down their funds and access reimbursements.
These clinics are similarly anticipating what Medicaid cuts will mean for them, especially since 58% of patients across all health centers in the state get their coverage through the government health program.
The Community Health & Wellness Center of Greater Torrington serves about 7,000 patients — about 52% of whom are on Medicaid — at their three locations in Torrington, Winsted and North Canaan. (They also have school-based health centers.)
Borduas, the CEO of those community health centers, participated in a recent call with DSS and other agencies to discuss ideas and input on the federal grant. Most community health center CEOs and the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut were also on the call.
She wants to see improvements in infrastructure, technology and broadband to help with virtual appointments like telehealth and e-consults, which allow specialists to connect virtually with primary care physicians and patients without needing to see them in person.
But to pull off those services, Borduas said, the right infrastructure needs to be in place.
Like the hospitals, the federally qualified health centers want to find other ways for workforce development amid growing fears of primary care provider shortages. Borduas said she floated a few ways to incentivize providing care in rural areas.
“I had mentioned things like tax credits or loan repayments or something that incentivizes them to say, ‘Yes, I want to go to this very far northwest corner, which is beautiful but doesn’t really have a lot to offer,'” Borduas said.
How rural may be defined
The federal program is branded as a rural health grant but is left open to interpretation and doesn’t explicitly define how states should interpret a region as rural. Kimball of the CT Hospital Association said there’s a need for a “whole state approach” given that Connecticut already has a lot of partnerships in health care.
Kramer said that while the area around Day Kimball is unequivocally rural, it doesn’t mean that people in the area aren’t seeking medical attention in more populated areas of Connecticut where there are partnerships.
“Just because we are definitively rural doesn’t mean that somewhere like a New Haven or a Hartford wouldn’t be the beneficiary of some of these funds, because on a tertiary level, they are a lot of the work that it is associated with advanced care for people who live in rural areas, because we don’t have the capability of doing everything within our organization, nor do some of the other true rural hospitals within the state,” he said.
It’s still unclear, however, how much those grants can be stretched beyond rural regions.
“Some of that discussion is that it’s very clear that this grant is meant for rural [areas], but is there a way to say we have a larger health partner somewhere in the middle of the state that is maybe more urban but can help put processes in place to help support the rural health centers?” Borduas said. “There’s no quite clear answer on that.”
But long-term viability is at the top of the list for Connecticut officials. They want to ensure that whatever the grant supports can continue beyond the five-year window.
“This is going to take some work to make it sustainable beyond those five years … because it will involve work with our local municipalities,” Borduas said. “We can’t do something sustainable if we don’t have support from other means, especially with the continued concerns about changes that are coming at the federal level.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25184660289863-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

Gavin Newsom said he's the opposite of President Donald Trump when it comes to climate change. But a letter by 40 groups says Newsom is abandoning key environmental policies.,"Gavin Newsom jetted off to New York this week to portray himself as the alternative to Donald Trump on climate policy.
During a speech to the United Nations during Climate Week NYC on Tuesday, Trump declared anew that concerns about climate change are “the greatest con job ever perpetrated in the world,” chiding other nations for efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
That set the stage for Newsom’s appearance at a New York Times-sponsored forum  Wednesday, where he labeled Trump’s assertions “an abomination” and “doubling down on stupid.”
 “You don’t have to believe in science. Believe in your own damn eyes,” Newsom said, while portraying California as a global leader in reducing pollution and shifting to a carbon-free economy.
“There’s no Elon Musk, there’s no Tesla, without California’s regulatory framework,” Newsom said.
His assertions drew pushback from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, who noted California has saddled its consumers with high energy bills.
“If you’re blue-collar, you’re working class, that hurts your quality of life,” said Wright, who spoke at the forum after Newsom.
The exchanges inadvertently framed Newsom’s efforts, as he gears up for a likely White House run in 2028, to maintain the image of a progressive politician, while appealing to voters outside his very blue state.
As Newsom was touting himself as a climate change warrior in New York, back home in California a coalition of more than 40 environmental groups was chastising him in a sharply worded letter for, they said, backsliding on the issue.
“As Governor Newsom touts his climate record on the national and international stage, we must not let him forget that it takes more than words to be a climate leader,” Nicole Ghio, executive director of Food & Water Watch California, said in a statement accompanying the letter. 
“He must stop caving to Big Oil interests and instead act to hold Big Oil accountable and advocate for the safety of our unique and beautiful environment and our vibrant communities. As President Trump slashes environmental protections and walks in lockstep with Big Oil, we need a leader — now more than ever — who will stand up for Californians and our climate.”
The letter listed pro-environment steps Newsom had taken during his administration, then ticked off ways he has recently shifted position, such as legislation to streamline approval of new oil and gas wells.
There’s no question Newsom — who had spent months excoriating refiners for gouging consumers on gasoline prices, even calling a special legislative session to impose new regulations — changed his tune after two refineries announced plans to shut down.
Those closures would sharply curtail supplies of fuel not only for California motorists but for those in Nevada and Arizona, while threatening the ability of airlines and military installations to obtain fuel and probably increasing prices that are already among the nation’s highest.
The environmental coalition letter zeroes in on that aspect of the situation: “Your administration took the unprecedented step of searching for a buyer for the Valero refinery in Benicia, which is slated for closure in 2026, using the resources and reputation of the state government to tip the scales in favor of fossil fuels when market forces make operations unprofitable. Reporting on potential $100M+ bailouts for the refinery are deeply concerning, as that would set an unacceptable precedent for supporting failing industries on public dollars.”
So it goes. The conflict between environmental protection and living costs is just one of many issues that Newsom must manage as he attempts to shift his image from California progressive to mainstream moderate in hopes of grabbing the political brass ring.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425-Gavin-Newsom-Climate-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

But Conine says he’s concerned about Nevada being paid back by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Conine, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, said he’s speaking out to “just let Nevada know it’s going to get weird before it gets unweird,” should Congress allow the government to shut down. “We’re doing what we can to understand what’s going on and preparing the state treasury to front these dollars.”
In the past, the state has provided funding to keep programs such as school lunches served during government shutdowns, and “historically, that has gotten cleared up when a continuing resolution gets passed,” Conine said during a phone interview Thursday.
Fronting state money poses “an opportunity cost issue,” Conine says, but allows vital services to continue, based in the past on the federal government’s pledge to reimburse the state. 
“I don’t have a ton of comfort that they’re actually going to make good on the promise. We don’t know that they’re actually going to pay us back. The government has not released guidance on whether or not we will get paid back. If they did make a promise that they were going to pay us back, would they actually do it?”
If the feds don’t settle up, Conine says, “the state will be out tens —maybe more — millions of dollars, depending how long we front for them.”
The state receives, on average, $5 million to $30 million a day from the federal government for programs at risk of shutting down, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides assistance to families for essentials such as rent and childcare. Funding expires Sept. 30. 
Conine says the Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) generally sends information to federal agencies who communicate details to states, such as what employees are deemed essential, who can be furloughed, and how agencies are to handle payments.
This time, the only memo Conine said he’s “seen to date” from OMB suggested the federal government “fire a bunch of people if given the opportunity to do so. Use this shutdown in order to do dramatic reductions in force.” The OMB, he says, wants agencies to fire employees who are not currently funded through a budget, and those with jobs outside the administration’s priorities. 
What that probably means, Conine says, “is you’re going to have a bunch of federal employees laid off. Even when the funding gets restored for some of these programs, there won’t be anyone on the other side to do the work.”
An existing example, he says, are student loan forgiveness programs, which “still exist but the people we need to make those programs work aren’t there anymore.” 
Medicaid and Medicare will not be affected, Conine says, because they are already funded. However, “peripheral” programs, such as substance abuse programs, or services to sign up for Medicaid, could be curtailed.
Gov. Joe Lombardo is aware of Conine’s plans, and has voiced no objections or input on which programs to sustain, the treasurer says.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ZachConine-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-26 11:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump to place tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, furniture, heavy trucks",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/26/tariffs-trump-prescription-drugs-heavy-trucks-cabinets/,"President Donald Trump is putting import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1.
The posts on his social media site showed that Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president’s confidence that taxes will help to reduce the government’s budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.
While Trump did not provide a legal justification for the tariffs, he appeared to stretch the bounds of his role as commander-in-chief by stating on Truth Social that the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed “for National Security and other reasons.”
Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the administration launched a Section 232 investigation in April about the impacts on national security from pharmaceutical drug and truck imports. The Commerce Department launched a 232 investigation into timber and lumber in March, though it’s unclear whether the furniture tariffs stem from that.
The tariffs are another dose of uncertainty for the U.S. economy with a solid stock market but a weakening outlook for jobs and elevated inflation. These new taxes on imports could pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices and dampen hiring, a process that economic data suggests is already underway.
[RELATED: Trump tariffs usher in uncertainty for CT businesses]
“We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for “most” or potentially “all” of the increase in inflation levels this year.
The president has pressured Powell to resign, arguing that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates more aggressively because inflation is no longer a concern. Fed officials have stayed cautious on rate cuts because of the uncertainty created by tariffs.
Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either “breaking ground” or being “under construction.” It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.
In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.
The pharmaceutical drug announcement was shocking as Trump has previously suggested that tariffs would be phased in over time so that companies had time to build factories and relocate production. On CNBC in August, Trump said he would start by charging a “small tariff” on pharmaceuticals and raise the rate over a year or more to 150% and even 250%.
According to the White House, the threat of tariffs earlier this year contributed to many major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, among others, to announce investments in U.S. production.
Pascal Chan, vice president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans’ health with “immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines.”
The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said there were signs of price pressures easing as sales listings increased 11.7% in August from a year ago, but the median price for an existing home was $422,600.
Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers that need to be defended.
“Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,” Trump posted.
Trump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.
His broader country-by-country tariffs relied on declaring an economic emergency based on a 1977 law, a drastic tax hike that two federal courts said exceeded Trump’s authority as president. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November.
The president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.
Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.
“There’s no inflation,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “We’re having unbelievable success.”
Still, Trump also acknowledged that his tariffs against China had hurt American farmers, who lost out on sales of soybeans. The president separately promised on Thursday to divert tariff revenues to the farmers hurt by the conflict, just as he did during his first term in 2018 and 2019 when his tariffs led to retaliation against the agricultural sector.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trucks.jpg,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)New Jersey should tighten Medicaid income thresholds, shift more senior care out of nursing homes, and move to boost its nursing workforce to maintain the program amid steep federal cuts, a new report says.
Thursday’s report by right-leaning think tank Garden State Initiative found looming federal cuts, rising health care costs, and enrollment that remains expanded following the pandemic threaten state finances despite the gains in health coverage brought by NJ FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
“New Jersey cannot keep patching Medicaid with temporary fixes. Without reforms, costs will overwhelm the budget and force cuts elsewhere,” said Danielle Zanzalari, an assistant professor of economics at Seton Hall University and the report’s author.
New Jersey expects to spend nearly $25.5 billion on Medicaid in the current July-to-June fiscal year, including $6.3 billion in state funds, $15 billion in federal funds, and $4.1 billion from drug manufacturer rebates, health insurance assessments, and other miscellaneous sources.
But changes to the federal insurance program made by Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce that funding by $990 billion over 10 years, establish work requirements for certain subscribers beginning in January 2027, and limit NJ FamilyCare coverage for children.
Officials at the Department of Community Affairs, which manages the state’s Medicaid program, have said New Jersey could lose $3.3 billion in annual Medicaid dollars. The reductions could take 350,000 residents — about 18% of all FamilyCare subscribers — off insurance rolls.
Lawmakers have repeatedly said the state lacks the ability to backfill the federal cuts.
The Garden State Initiative report says New Jersey should regularly audit its membership to ensure eligibility — Medicaid eligibility reviews were paused during the pandemic and resumed in April 2023 — and consider lowering the income limit for children under the age of 19.
To be eligible to enroll in NJ FamilyCare, a household must make no more than 138% of the federal poverty level. That’s $21,600 annually for a single person and $44,376 for a four-person household.
Individuals aged 18 and under are eligible as long as their household income is no more than 355% of the federal poverty level, or $110,760 annually for a family of four.
“New Jersey should assess whether current eligibility thresholds remain fiscally sustainable and adjust them to balance access with budget realities,” the report says.
It adds that New Jersey should consider barring pharmacy benefit managers — an insurance middleman that negotiates drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of insurers — from owning pharmacies. Health care affordability advocates have regularly pointed to pharmacy benefit managers as a cause of rising prescription drug prices.
New Jersey should weigh joining a multi-state drug purchasing pool to boost its negotiating power and reduce Medicaid-related pharmacy costs, though that purchasing pool should have allowances for new drugs, the report says.
And the state should establish a separate reserve fund for Medicaid to guard against future funding cuts or enrollment surges that, absent reserves, could imperil plan coverage, according to the report.
Deemphasizing nursing homes in favor of assisted living facilities and home care could also save the state money, the report found.
Average monthly costs for nursing homes in New Jersey in 2022 ($11,253) were 344% higher than they were for home care ($2,534) and 73% higher than assisted living ($6,495), according to a 2023 AARP survey. Nursing home services often include costs not covered by assisted living facilities or home care.
“Without long-term care reform and workforce investment, the system will remain financially strained and structurally unsustainable,” the report says.
The state should also look to boost its nursing workforce following pandemic departures and amid projections from the New Jersey Collaborative Center for Nursing that warn the state will lack 24,450 nurses by 2036.
The state should boost scholarships, certification programs, and technical education for nurses to expand access to the profession; recruit nurses from other states or nations; and create pathways that afford aides and lower-practice nurses advancement opportunities to higher practices.
“The solutions are not complicated: contain costs by addressing eligibility and holding (managed care plans) accountable, shift care toward in-home and community-based services, and invest in the nurse workforce,” Zanzalari said.
Lawmakers have weighed legislation that would allow nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals to practice in New Jersey for up to a year while awaiting decisions on their New Jersey licensure applications. An earlier version of that bill won unanimous Assembly approval last March, but its amended version has yet to see floor votes in either chamber.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Academic outcomes for Minnesota students have stagnated since the pandemic in both reading and math, with 2025 state assessments showing little change since tests of students in grades 3-8 resumed in 2022.
A Reformer analysis of test scores from 2019 to 2025 found that less than one out of every seven Minnesota school districts have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency rates in either subject since students were pushed into online learning in March 2020. The districts that did recover fully serve only 5% of students in the state and are mostly smaller districts.
Among the 120 districts with at least 1,000 students, just five districts have returned to or surpassed their 2019 proficiency rates in 2025 in either subject.
Nationally, every state is showing worse academic outcomes than in 2019, according to the Education Recovery Scorecard. But unlike Minnesota, some states have started to show students on an upward trajectory.
Using data from national and state assessments in 2024, the scorecard ranked Minnesota students’ pandemic recovery 45th in math and 38th in reading. The report estimated Minnesota students remained about three-quarters of a year behind in math and half a year behind in reading compared to where students were before the pandemic. In other words, a Minnesota fourth grader knew as much as in 2019 as a child halfway through fifth grade in 2025. Similarly, students are still half a year behind in both reading and math nationwide, according to the report.
Some of the top states for academic recovery include Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, none of which typically make lists of the best states for public education.




Eastern Carver County School District is one of the few large Minnesota districts where test scores have increased in math. In 2019, 54% of the district’s students were meeting or exceeding state standards in math, which dropped to 51% in 2022. Scores have rebounded and now 56% of students are testing as proficient in math.
Superintendent Erin Rathke and Assistant Superintendent Nate Manaen said that the district’s culture around continuous school improvement — analyzing student data and changing instructional practices to improve student outcomes — is strong.
“It’s important for us to give credit to our teachers. We have excellent teachers that are buying into the curriculum, are looking at data, and making adjustments for our students,” Rathke said in an interview with the Reformer.
The district also focused on accelerating students’ learning after the pandemic, rather than lowering standards.
“Eastern Carver County was really intentional about saying we are not going to water down what learning looks like. And instead, really be intentional about accelerating students as they come back,” Manaen said.
According to Manaen, teachers, principals and district leadership were all focused on making sure that math classes were both rigorous and engaging for students when they returned to in-person learning.
At the middle school level, that meant implementing an instructional model called “building thinking classrooms” that is a form of what’s known as inquiry-based instruction. This entails students engaged in more discussion in math class, solving problems in groups and discussing their strategies. Manaen and Rathke say keeping students engaged in the classroom has been a key to the district’s improvements.

Pillager School District, a small, rural district near Brainerd, was one of the few school districts that saw higher proficiency in both math and reading in 2025 compared to 2019. Ryan Krominga, the director of curriculum and instruction, credits the improvement in part to the district’s manageable size.
Whereas large districts had to coordinate more transportation, food and other logistics during the pandemic, smaller districts “have fewer people to get on the phone with and start to shift things around,” Krominga said. As a result, Pillager was able to return to the classroom on the earlier side, with some in-person instruction starting in the fall of 2020.
In-person instruction is far more effective, especially for the youngest learners, than online.
Another factor was the district’s strategic use of COVID-19 federal assistance money. To support pandemic recovery, the federal government gave K-12 schools $190 billion in financial assistance. Minnesota schools received about $2.6 billion.
States had wide latitude in how to guide districts to use the funds. While some states took a narrow approach, limiting districts to a few strategies, Minnesota took a kitchen sink approach, allowing districts to spend on 18 different strategies.
Some districts, like Minneapolis Public Schools, allocated a majority of their federal funds to giving educators bonuses and raises, and closing their pre-existing structural budget deficit while building up financial reserves, which were also allowed uses.
Early evidence from California shows districts that spent more on academic support have had greater academic recovery.
Pillager School District used part of its federal cash on hotspot technology to keep its students connected in a rural area with spottier internet access. Krominga said that teacher-student connectivity was a priority when thinking of ways to use the funds.
Pillager allocated another portion of the federal funds, which have since run out, to expanding summer school services to all students — three weeks of targeted learning in the morning and summer camp activities in the afternoon, transportation included.

In Minnesota, expanded summer school programs were used to serve about 6% of students, per 2023 data. In contrast, nearly 7% of students in Louisiana received tutoring and 11% of students had access to expanded summer school programs because of federal pandemic aid.
Krominga, who has a 12-year-old son, said he’s hopeful about the future of Minnesota’s education despite a pandemic dip across the state, in part due to revised math standards in 2022 and the 2023 READ Act, which overhauled literacy instruction.
“The training that we’re doing for teachers is having an impact,” Krominga said. “We’re probably a couple years out before we start to see state tests changing.”







Data
All data comes from the Minnesota Department of Education Data Center. We used All-Standards Based Public MCA/MTAS Results files to look at MCA proficiency rates for both math and reading. MCA/MTAS proficiency rates use the population of test-takers as the denominator, whereas North Star proficiency rates use the total population of students, including students in tested grades who did not participate in testing. We chose to use MCA/MTAS proficiency rates to avoid artificially deflating the proficiency rates for schools with low test participation.
Data for total enrollment and percent of students who would be eligible for Free and Reduced-Price lunch under federal guidelines comes from the MDE Students file. Students are eligible for Free and Reduced-Price lunch under federal guidelines if they live in a household below 185% of the federal poverty line, and the corresponding column in our data table is labeled as such. The joined data set (enrollment data and MCA/MTAS data for 2019, 2022 and 2025) can be found here.
As a note, we present the proficiency rates for those three years to illustrate the trends of school districts, not specific student cohorts. The student cohorts for the three years we included (2019, 2022 and 2025) differ, and we did not adjust for changes in student demographics for this analysis. Results for smaller districts are more sensitive to small changes in student performance compared to larger districts, and it’s best to compare results across similar-sized districts.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250919_1294-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

She said DOC recorded 22,000 inmates at its low but that the state now has more than 25,000 individuals in custody, with facilities operating at more than 95% capacity.
Auxier told lawmakers that Indiana’s facilities are once again filling up. 
“Now, we’re seeing an increase in our population overall,” she said. “To try to mitigate some of these issues, we have implemented a policy to allow more minimum security placements. We actually will eventually go onto a waitlist. So we’re trying to get those folks that are low-risk individuals into a facility that would help them transition better back into the community.”
Prison numbers rising
She noted that “an influx” of Level 6 offenders “are coming back to us to serve their time in DOC instead of at the county level.”
Auxier also pointed to sentencing changes as a factor behind the rise. 
“If you think about it, just from a numbers perspective, 75% is more than 50% so they’re serving a longer period of incarceration,” she said, referring to changes in Indiana’s sentencing laws that increased the portion of a sentence that offenders must serve — from 50%, or day-for-day credit, to 75%, or three-for-one credit.

That change means offenders now serve a longer period of their sentence in prison, which Auxier said contributes to a higher prison population over time.
“Those individuals kind of stack up over time,” she continued. “That’s what we’re seeing as a stacking effect.”
Chris Daniels of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council additionally highlighted a decade-long shift in criminal filings. 
“We’ve seen a pretty dramatic increase in the most violent crimes, in our most serious levels, in terms of our murders and our level one and two felonies,” Daniels said. 
“Our threes, fours and fives, they’ve stayed about the same,” he added, referring to felony offenders. “And then we see a decrease in some of our level sixes and a fairly significant drop in our misdemeanor charges.”
There are six felony levels with level one being the highest.
According to prosecutor data, Indiana courts handled 316 murder filings in 2015 compared to a projected 572 this year. Filings for the lowest-level offenses have moved in the opposite direction, with misdemeanors falling from more than 220,000 in 2015 to under 190,000 projected for 2025.

Daniels said the complexity of those top-tier cases — murders, rapes and major drug-dealing prosecutions — has forced prosecutors to shift resources away from low-level filings. 
“These are complex drug dealing cases, rape cases, terrible child molest cases, the types of stuff that we really want prosecutors’ offices focusing on,” Daniels said.
But Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council further noted that despite spikes in violent incidents, overall crime trends have been relatively flat or down.
“On average, crime is declining or holding steady, but there are spikes in certain places,” he said. He warned that “suicide, alcohol, drug-related deaths far outnumber homicides,” and that jails and prisons too often serve as “the providers of last resort” for behavioral health.
Funding shortfalls
Shifting gears, Scott Hall, executive director of Marion County Community Corrections, told the interim committee that probation and community corrections now supervise more than 106,000 Hoosiers daily. But state grant funding — the primary support for such programs — has been flat for seven years and was cut by $7 million statewide this year, with more reductions expected in 2026.
“We are community supervision,” Hall said. “We are more cost effective than having someone in a jail or prison, and the services that we provide then provide individuals an opportunity to get out of the system and hopefully avoid returning to the system.”
Local impacts of the cuts are already showing up in next year’s grant awards. Monroe County, for example, will lose funding for both its drug court and mental health court, according to DOC records presented to the committee.

In Lake County, community corrections saw its award shrink by nearly $600,000, with reductions hitting its re-entry and veterans courts.
Smaller counties face similar challenges. Boone County lost support for jail treatment programming, while Dubois County’s request for expanded community supervision was pared back.
Hall cautioned that the timing could not be worse.
“The need has never been greater,” he said. “Cutting these programs now will only push more people into already overcrowded jails and prisons.”
Still, Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, raised questions about the program’s financial accountability. He pressed Hall for specifics on how much of the program’s budget comes from state grants, county contributions and user fees. Freeman was especially concerned about the lack of data on how many participants are declared indigent and therefore do not pay for services.
“Only government can be so special as to tell me, ‘We have a funding problem. We have no idea how many people don’t pay for a service that they’re actually using, but I need more money from the state,’” Freeman said.
The senator acknowledged the challenges that come with collecting fees from participants, however, especially once debts are sent to collections.
“I mean, look, there is a finite amount of money. In my time in the General Assembly, the amount of money that the taxpayers give to government has almost doubled,” Freeman said. “I don’t know if that’s right or wrong. I’m just telling you it’s almost doubled.”
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, pressed lawmakers to confront the root causes of crime rather than only funding prisons. 
“Most of the people we’re encountering in these programs, they either have substance use disorders or mental health issues or most of the time, both,” Pierce said. “Unless we start funding these programs to get at the underlying cause of crime, we’re going to continue to have our constituents frustrated. Why does this person keep coming back all the time? Why didn’t you just lock them up forever?”

(Getty Images)It’s one thing to read about a 10% cut in government spending and it’s quite another to delve into spending plans that agencies are filing to meet that mandate. Over and over, it’s clear that state employees are on the front line, shouldering the burden.
If I had to cut 10% from my household budget, I’d have places to look: cutting media subscriptions or streaming and cable services, eating out less, moving to a cheaper phone plan, skipping an annual vacation. You get the point.
But for many agencies, most of their spending — sometimes, more than 90% — is on the employees performing the services for constituents.
So, agencies are laying off employees, not filling jobs and ultimately piling more on staffers that stay. They have to do their own work and the duties of former coworkers.
Two agencies filing plans to meet spending reductions note that positions leaders deem “critical” can be filled — “but first must be vacant for at least 30 calendar days before being posted” to “ensure at least 60-90+ days of cost savings.”
Indiana agencies cut staff, contracts as mandatory spending plans roll in

Some are trying to make up for it. The Commission for Higher Education, reported redistributing responsibilities to remaining personnel, along with a collective $70,000 in raises, “to recognize the additional workload.” But the spending plans that have been approved contain few similar examples.
There’s no exact count of layoffs, as news trickles out agency by agency. But the overall loss is coming up in the state’s headcount.
Last December, Indiana peaked at 32,218 state employees. Four agencies — Department of Correction, Family and Social Services Administration, Department of Child Services and Department of Transportation — account for about half of that total.
As of Wednesday, that number has dropped to 30,616. That’s a 5% drop, in less than a year, under Gov. Mike Braun.
I can’t tell you how many employees have reached out in concern. They love their jobs and want to help Hoosiers. But they are frustrated.
First, thousands were forced to come back to the office after hybrid work agreements were rescinded. That has led to irritation – especially those who see Braun spending time at his personal residence in Jasper and getting state-paid helicopter flights back and forth.
Employees, meanwhile, are fighting for spots in crowded parking garages or switching their hours to before dawn to avoid traffic.
How else are agencies cutting spending?
They are also canceling contracts, not replacing vehicles and looking for legal changes, like relaxed mailing requirements.

And at the same time, some of the agencies have additional duties – such as the Indiana Department of Revenue. Lawmakers added a tax amnesty program in the state budget but didn’t provide resources to make it happen.
Some agencies are receiving exemptions from the cuts. For instance, the Indiana Department of Health successfully requested an exemption to fund the licensing and surveying of health care facilities, according to the spending plan. This is a safety measure that should not be compromised.
And when leaders want a program, they prioritize it.
That will likely happen later this year, as a special session to redistrict congressional boundaries seems inevitable. That could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, depending on how long it lasts. And the Indiana Department of Correction keeps buying expensive execution drugs — up to $300,000 per dose – with some of it expiring unused.
Of course, it’s good to maximize efficiency and make sure state government hasn’t grown too much. But the way to do that is to eliminate unnecessary programs and duties. The problem with today’s effort is that duties are continually added and never taken away. And that leaves fewer state employees to handle the load.

Newly revised numbers show that Michigan actually lost 13,800 jobs in the 12 months ending in March, instead of the 25,900 jobs reportedly created in the period.
“It was an ouch,” said Gabe Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics.
The preliminary benchmark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows there were 911,000 fewer U.S. jobs created in the 12 months ending in March than reported in the closely watched monthly figures. It was the largest preliminary revision by the bureau in records going back to 2000 and cut U.S. job growth in the period in half.
Michigan had 39,700 jobs wiped out in the revision, the third most in the country behind North Carolina (56,900) and Colorado (51,200). Most of those lost jobs — 31,300 — came out of metro Detroit.
But the revision added 26,800 jobs to metro Grand Rapids. That was the highest-percentage jobs jump among metro areas with populations of one million or more.
The revision covered the last nine months of President Joseph Biden’s administration and most of the first three months of President Donald Trump’s administration. It didn’t provide monthly overestimates.
Ehrlich, who has been forecasting Michigan’s economy for years, cautioned that the final benchmark revision could reveal a smaller loss when it’s tabulated early next year, as has happened in the past.
And monthly BLS data show that Michigan has added 21,300 payroll jobs since March.
The conflicting numbers illustrate how difficult it is to understand what’s happening in a state economy being roiled by Trump’s chaotic tariff and trade policies and the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In its latest Michigan economic forecast this month, Ehrlich and his U-M colleagues took the unusual step of not estimating state government revenues for the next two years because of the unknown impact of the new federal tax-and-spending law.
“We believe there are important open questions about how these changes will interact with state revenue collections, and that these changes likely represent the largest updates to our outlook for state revenues since May,” the forecast said. “We expect to issue an updated full report and analysis with our November forecast.”
Their September outlook shows continued payroll job growth over the next two years, although at a much slower pace than the past several years. The state is expected to add 13,700 jobs next year and 12,100 in 2027, down from 38,700 this year.
But Ehrlich said he’s concerned about the state’s shrinking labor force. Employers added 5,000 jobs in August, according to the monthly report from the state Department of Technology, Management and Budget released earlier this month.
But the same report showed that 7,000 fewer people were employed than in July and that 14,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. August’s state jobless rate fell slightly from 5.3% in July to 5.2% in August, mostly because of workers holding or seeking jobs.
“All I can say is that this month’s report is a real head-scratcher,” Ehrlich told me, adding that people shouldn’t “over-interpret” one month’s data.
But the labor force has been shrinking for five straight months and is down by 38,000 working-age adults since March.
And jobs are getting harder to find in Michigan. There were 1.44 unemployed people in the state for every available job in June, the highest level in five years.

A major part of the data confusion is the yawning gap between reported payroll jobs created by businesses and a separate household survey that determines the unemployment rate.
That’s not unusual in an uncertain, declining economy. Economists generally put more stock in the payroll numbers reported by businesses. But Ehrlich said this time what working people are reporting in government surveys might paint a more accurate picture of the job market.
“What we see right now is that the household survey may be mostly right,” Ehrlich said. “It’s tough to know.”
And it’s getting tougher, thanks to the Trump administration’s assault on the BLS, which collects a variety of crucial jobs and economic data.
In August, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weak jobs report. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the BLS rigged the jobs numbers to make him look bad.
(Just wondering: if McEntarfer, a Biden appointee, was cooking the books to hurt Trump, why would she have approved the big jobs revision that diminishes Biden’s record?)
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has kept up the attack, saying the jobs numbers won’t be accurate until key people hired in Democratic administrations are purged from the agency.
Ehrlich said he still has confidence in the BLS, which he called “an unappreciated gem,” but he and other economists say data collection can be improved.
Part of the problem is that initial response rates from businesses and households have been declining since Covid, leading to big revisions as more data is collected.
“The BLS is doing the best job it can,” Ehrlich told me. “It’s a challenging job and there’s always room to improve. The resources have not been there to do that.”
It’s easier for Trump to blame the data rather than his own destructive policies, which are killing jobs, raising prices, stalling business investment and souring consumers.

Older adults, their families and caregivers can complete a survey online or participate in a virtual public listening session to share suggestions. 
“The community’s input is critical as we develop the next four years of services for Mississippi’s older adults,” KenYada Blake-Washington, director of the MDHS Division of Aging & Adult Services, said in a press release. “We want to hear from the community about what matters most to them and their families.”
The State Plan on Aging is the “blueprint” for the division, which provides services to people 60 and older, Blake-Washington told Mississippi Today. The agency crafts a new plan every four years. 
The plan aims to improve services for older Mississippians and identify barriers that prevent them from accessing those services.
“It’s a call to action, improvement, resource alignment and allocation,” Blake-Washington said. 
The Aging and Adult Services division works with 10 area agencies on aging on a range of services, including nutrition and meal programs, transportation, case management, legal assistance and caregiver support.
The state plan will fuse input from the area agencies on aging, federal requirements, state-level goals and input from Mississippians. 
The state’s population is swiftly aging. Between 2010 and 2020, Mississippi saw a 34% increase in people 65 and older. 
Older adults, their families and caregivers can complete an online survey to provide  suggestions. The survey’s deadline is Oct. 30. 
The Division of Aging and Adult Services will hold three virtual public listening sessions for input. The first two are next week: 4-5:30 p.m. Monday and 9-10:30 a.m. Wednesday. The third session is 10-11:30 a.m. Oct. 14.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06185626/MDHS-Resource-and-Referral-Center8.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

Dave Upthegrove wants a $60 million boost for wildfire prevention funding that was shortchanged in the last legislative session. Plus, he is seeking $44.8 million more for wildfire fighting for the 2026 fiscal year, which runs through next June. 
In a letter to Office of Financial Management Director K.D. Chapman-See, making the request, Upthegrove acknowledged the “difficult choices” budget-writers will face in 2026. 
State revenue is falling short of expectations despite significant tax increases this year, and many state agencies are absorbing cuts lawmakers made to balance the current budget.
“With this reality in mind, our budget proposals are carefully crafted, targeted, and respectful of the fiscal challenges before the governor and Legislature,” Upthegrove wrote.

In 2021, state lawmakers approved House Bill 1168, which committed $500 million over eight years to the state Department of Natural Resources for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending largely kept up with that target until this year. The department received $115 million in the last two-year budget and $130 million in the one before that. But in the current budget, lawmakers provided just $60 million. 
The Department of Natural Resources was prepared for this year’s fire season and has money in the account left over from past years for some additional fire prevention work, which can include activities like tree thinning and prescribed burns. 
But the department says that reduced funding limits the amount of work it can do to prepare for upcoming fire seasons. 
“Without these funds, Washington could see an increased number of fires that are going to be larger and cost the taxpayers more money,” Upthegrove said in his budget request.
Agencies filed requests this month with the Office of Financial Management for the 2026 supplemental budget lawmakers will write next year. Gov. Bob Ferguson will release his spending plan in December, which will serve as a starting point for discussions.
The supplemental budget will make adjustments to the two-year plan approved this year. 
Wildfires are continuing to increase in severity and frequency in Washington, with forecasts showing that Natural Resources will need a minimum of $44.8 million more than the Legislature allotted for fire suppression in 2026. 
The request is based on a forecasting model that analyzes the last 10 years of firefighting costs. 
But with wildland fire season now lasting longer than it has in the last 10 years and stretching well into the fall, the department plans to recalculate its cost projections in January to account for money spent battling late-season wildfires. 
The current budget approved by the Legislature this year allocates $79.5 million from the general fund for wildfire suppression in 2026, down from over $100 million each year between 2022 and 2025. 
So far this year, wildfire suppression has cost the state about $93 million, not counting funds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to reimburse for the Burdoin fire in the Columbia River Gorge.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9214-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

Thursday on the gubernatorial campaign trail proved otherwise.,"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill will face off in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)NEW BRUNSWICK — In a crowded room on the Rutgers campus on Thursday, two state senators tried to impart the wisdom of political civility to students at the very moment our state’s gubernatorial race was devolving into the campaign’s ugliest day yet.
Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Republican, and Sen. Joe Cryan, a Democrat, are on what they’re calling a college civility tour, one they announced after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed on Sept. 10. I have my doubts about whether two lawmakers from New Jersey can help drag American politics out of the sewer, so I visited Rutgers to see if Bramnick and Cryan would dispel my doubts.
Momentarily, they did. Bramnick spoke somberly about the strife and violence of the 1960s and how he fears those days are returning, and Cryan was sincere when he urged the students to remember that we don’t all live life’s experiences the same way.
“Always keep in mind that somebody else’s perspective isn’t ours, and as a result of that, let’s listen, learn, and be a part of the great shared experience called this American experiment,” he said.
Well said! Unfortunately, outside the walls of that room on Rutgers’ campus, the race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy was deteriorating into acrimony, raising doubts about Bramnick’s and Cryan’s premise that we can all just get along.
The ugliness stems from two stories that dropped Thursday, one from the New Jersey Globe that says Democrat Mikie Sherrill did not walk with her graduating class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1994 as punishment related to a massive cheating scandal that implicated more than 100 of her classmates, and a CBS News report that the National Archives released an unredacted copy of Sherrill’s military records to an ally of her GOP opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, records the Ciattarelli campaign then distributed to reporters without shielding personal information related to her and her family.
Republicans used the Globe story to accuse Sherrill of “cheating her way” through the Naval Academy, and are calling on her to release her disciplinary records to confirm her claim that she was merely punished for not turning in students who did cheat. And Sherrill said the CBS story proves the Trump administration and Ciattarelli are “breaking the law and exposing private records for political gain.”
The problem for Sherrill: The Globe story calls into question the very thing she has centered her campaign on, her military record. Contemporaneous reports about the cheating scandal — an unknown number of students obtained a copy of an electrical engineering exam days before the test was given — indicate the Navy believed 15% of Sherrill’s graduating class were implicated, and a special naval tribunal found dozens guilty of honor violations and issued them punishments like loss of privileges, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Sherrill’s claim that she didn’t walk in her graduation ceremony as punishment for not turning in fellow students who cheated is a plausible story. She could confirm it by letting us take a peek at those disciplinary records, but her campaign has nixed that idea.
What should have been a victory lap for the Ciattarelli campaign, though, was marred by the CBS story, which implicates the campaign in distributing documents that included Sherrill’s Social Security number, personal information about her parents, life insurance details … incredibly personal stuff handed out to reporters and God knows who else. The campaign has pinned the blame on the National Archives, which appears to be 100% responsible for releasing the unredacted records in the first place, but had no role in giving them to members of the media.
Both stories dropped the same day a new poll said the governor’s race is all tied up, with Ciattarelli and Sherrill both at 43% and a whopping 11% of voters undecided. If this race is indeed a dead heat, things are only going to get uglier from here.
Meanwhile, David Weigel of Semafor reported Thursday that conservative super PAC American Principles Project is going to flood our airwaves with an ad to scare voters about transgender people. Really nasty stuff.
Back on the Rutgers campus, I asked Bramnick what he thought of the civility of the current gubernatorial campaign.
“Not bad, actually. I watched the debate — I didn’t really hear any personal insults. I think it’s shockingly good from that standpoint,” he said.
He’s right that Sunday’s debate was no brawl. But I think the days of this race being civil are over. Buckle up.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As Indiana’s maternal and infant mortality rates tick down, the work isn’t done for health care advocates seeking to improve the state’s outcomes. 
Over a dozen people spoke to the state’s Interim Study Committee on Public Health, Behavioral Health and Human Services Thursday, speaking about the need to improve access to mental health services for new mothers and ways to reduce mortality rates.
“I think this shows how we have to wrap our arms around these moms and these families. In some instances, it’s an exhausted mom who works the night shift,” said State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver. “But it’s also educating babysitters and grandmas, etc. on safe sleep practices. 
“It really does come down to education. Unfortunately, there’s no one silver bullet.”
Hoosiers have long had one of the worst mortality rates in the wealthy world for all new mothers, but especially for Black moms. Similar racial disparities exist for newborn children. 
The state has made strides when it comes to infant health  — reporting the lowest mortality rate since the state started gathering data 100 hundred years ago. Deaths for mothers remain above pre-COVID levels as of 2022, though there’s a data lag so members of the Indiana Maternal Mortality Review Committee can assess every single death.
 
The National Maternal Mental Health Hotline is free, confidential and available 24/7. Call or text at 1-833-TLC-MAMA or 1-833-852-6262.


“National data from the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) shows that nearly 80% of (maternal) mortalities are considered preventable, so we are seeing many states focus on this postpartum period to reduce overall mortalities and improve maternal health,” said Kendall Speer, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Speer highlighted several efforts in other states that could be introduced in Indiana, such as removing prior authorization requirements for certain antidepressants for mothers, authorizing more providers to give perinatal maternal counseling and requiring hospitals or insurers to distribute information. 
But the state has deeply cut funding for programs with local public health departments that were working to improve infant and maternal health outcomes. Using $225 million under Health First Indiana, counties reported more than 352,000 services to moms and infants — the second-most common use for funding following school-based health programming.
Facing a budget crunch, Republicans chose to cut funding for the program after just two years, disrupting the biggest investment in public health in decades.
Examples of programming from the previous round of funding include collaborating with local milk banks or paying for visiting health providers to check on local moms at home. Another county focused specifically on developing relationships with Amish midwives and prenatal care to prevent preeclampsia.
 Presentation specifics

A big target for health care advocates was emphasizing the importance of perinatal care, or doctor appointments during the earliest stages of pregnancy. The Department of Health reported that two out of every five infants who died received no care in the first semester of pregnancy. 
But getting to the doctor is another compilation in a state with a dwindling number of OBGYN professionals. Though not mentioned during the meeting, states with abortion bans have seen OBGYNs leave their practices for states protecting reproductive health procedures. Additionally, as health care costs soar and some facilities opt to merge, rural hospitals have closed their expensive delivery and maternal care units. 
“We are struggling to recruit and we are struggling to keep the ones we have,” Dr. Julie Tillman, with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told the committee. 
She added that even when the state graduates 20 trained OBGYNs each year, only half stay to practice in the state.
Combined with other factors, pregnant Hoosiers have fewer and fewer resources to access perinatal care, especially those located outside of urban areas. Rep. Cindy Ledbetter, a nurse practitioner in southern Indiana, noted that state efforts to grow her field could help alleviate that gap — though the state also has a nursing shortage.

The state’s oversight of the Medicaid program could also be an opportunity to improve both maternal and infant health. Medicaid covers roughly half of all births in the state and just over half of the infants who died in the last year were born to mothers who were enrolled on Medicaid at the time of their birth. Recently, the state extended Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months, rather than 60 days, to help new mothers get access to health services.
“That fact that they’re on Medicaid — I think we have a responsibility as a state and for the Medicaid department to make this one of our priorities,” said Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis, about infant deaths.
 Mental health and substance use disorder

One of leading causes of death for new mothers in Indiana is substance use, though it’s known as a pregnancy-associated death because pregnancy plays a role but isn’t the sole direct cause. Nationwide, such deaths are categorized with mental health conditions, which are the second-leading cause of death for new moms.
“We know that one-in-five women experience mental health challenges before and after pregnancy — and that might be an underestimate,” said Speer. 
Speer highlighted the state’s Perinatal Quality Collaborative, which includes a practice bundle for providers treating pregnant or postpartum people with substance use disorders. States can also use Medicaid to cover doulas, who are nonmedical providers who can focus on the mental and physical health of the mother throughout the pregnancy and beyond. Such practitioners have shown great promise in improving maternal outcomes.

Albertina Jones, an Indianapolis doula, shared that one young mother called her asking if she should induce her own pregnancy with something she could buy over-the-counter, not knowing about the potential complications.
“We’re just regular people — we’re not medical doctors,” said Jones. “It creates a safe space for young women who are not knowledgeable to come to us … they can tell us just about anything and we can give them the right information.”
Mental health screenings at doctor offices could catch depression and other mental health conditions, especially if parents are also screened by their child’s pediatrician. Forty percent of mothers skip their own postpartum appointments, but could get care during doctor visits for their children. 
Dr. Evan Kreutzer, with the Indiana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, noted the mental health burden on all family members — not just new mothers. He said he’d seen fathers who also dealt with depression following a birth and emphasized the benefit of screening patients as a pediatrician.
“It’s a whole family health issues and, by extension, a child health issue,” said Kreutzer. “In my own practice, I’ve had numerous mothers and fathers quietly circle ‘yes’ on a screening or questionnaire when asked if they had thoughts of harming themselves. 
“Almost without fail, they had never told anyone else. Because we screened, we were able to connect them to care.”
However, he said that providers needed to know where to refer parents for further services. He said he usually screened any adult who brought a newborn child to an appointment.
The committee will meet again on Oct. 15 with a focus on its final report and whether the Department of Education should be required to develop a water safety curriculum for schools.

(Image courtesy FWP)You really can’t make this stuff up.  Last week Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologists electroshocked the Big Hole River to collect data as part of a trout “adult mortality study” in conjunction with Montana State University.  If the goal was to induce mortality in adult trout, they succeeded — and left a long trail of dead fish in their wake.
The incident was first reported by Craig Jones of Great Divide Outfitters, who was on the 3.8 mile stretch between the Jerry Creek and Greenwood Bottoms fishing access sites.   As reported by the Montana Standard’s Duncan Adams, Jones put it bluntly: “I came in the day after they’d electrofished and there were dead fish everywhere.  It’s just a bummer. It’s just one blow after another (for the river).”
Indeed, the picture Jones posted online shows a very large adult brown trout, half a dozen rainbow trout and a whitefish, just a small part of the more than 70 dead fish they were able to net.  Jones added that some dead fish were too small to net and count and eagles were busy retrieving carcasses, meaning there were far more than they counted.
As someone who makes their living on the river, Jones said it made no sense to electrofish after a fish-stressing summer beset by low flows and warm temperatures, adding: “I don’t know how many beatings the fish can take.”
The Big Hole is easily one of the most distressed “blue ribbon” trout streams in Montana.  It’s been chronically dewatered by over-appropriated irrigation withdrawals for decades.  Combine that with the declining precipitation and increasing temperatures of climate change from human-caused atmospheric pollution, and the river’s low flows and high water temperature woes were magnified to such an extent that the river was partially or fully closed to fishing for much of the summer.
When questioned about electroshocking the already severely stressed fish, the agency responded: “We added an abbreviated fall sampling effort during the MSU studies to provide an opportunity to recapture tagged fish before fall spawning and winter, which compartmentalizes the year in a way that will allow us to better characterize when mortality is occurring.”
They certainly were able to “characterize when mortality is occurring” — although the agency claimed “we didn’t see any immediate mortality during this fish sampling effort, clearly there was some impact.”
Indeed, for the Big Hole’s trout, it’s just another in a long line of “impacts” from gathering “data” for the MSU study.  As noted in its 2024 report, the Big Hole fish were already electroshocked, captured, “tranquilized with clove oil,” and had “internal and external passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag(s)” stuck in them — all of which required significant handling of the fish, which has been shown to have negative effects, including mortality.  Incredibly, the agency “conducted a recapture run about one week after the initial tagging event.”
At what point do we draw the line on death of fish and game by data gathering for state agencies, organizations, and/or universities?  Anglers and organizations had already complained about the agency re-opening fishing in violation of the Big Hole Watershed Committee’s drought plan when the flows were below 25%.  Despite public outcry, the already stressed fish were then electroshocked handled, counted, measured, weighed and tagged once again…from which many did not survive.
They can beat around the bush and kill fish through “data gathering” but the Big Hole’s primary problem is insufficient instream flows for the fish to survive and reproduce. That “critical data” is easily gathered by looking at the river’s stream gauges — and then doing something about it.

Industry leaders see a fertile political environment in the region, but say challenges lie ahead.
The post Wyoming, Utah and Idaho push for nuclear energy renaissance appeared first on WyoFile .","IDAHO FALLS—A couple hundred nuclear energy industry officials, along with two western state governors, a Trump administration official and the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, gathered Monday at the Idaho National Laboratory’s sprawling 890-square-mile testing center to discuss nuclear power’s future in the West.
In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground. 
“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State. 
Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn. 
Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”
Energy ‘superabundance’ 
As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.
Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.
“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.
“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”
The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.
Challenges 
Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.
Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.
“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”
Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.
“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.
Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.
In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.
“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”

The latest fossils unearthed in Wyoming’s Natural Trap Cave include the skeleton of a mammoth. 
The post A mammoth discovery in the Bighorn Basin appeared first on WyoFile .","It was on one of the last days of the 2024 field season that a group of researchers got a hunch that they’d found something unusual at the bottom of an 85-foot cave in northern Wyoming. 
“We’d found a mammoth vertebra, just a centrum,” recalled Julie Meachen, a professor at Des Moines University Medicine and Health Sciences in Iowa. 
Since 2014, when Meachen and other scientists got the green light to excavate Natural Trap Cave in the Bighorn Basin, they’ve unearthed the bones of prehistoric mammals, including the American cheetah and short-faced bear.
As the name implies, the cave acted as a deadly trap for animals traveling the plains, unaware of the pit until it was too late. Their fossils — dating from 20,000 years ago — are often found in good condition since the cave’s cool and humid conditions act as a refrigerator. 
But mammoth bones aren’t common in the cave, Meachen told WyoFile.
“They’re not really running animals,” Meachen said. “They probably would have known the cave was there. They kind of look to where their feet go.”
So it was all the more a delight on one of the first days of the 2025 season when Meachen’s team began to uncover most of the mammoth’s cervical vertebrae, some of the thoracic vertebrae, some ribs and most of the scapula. 
“This is a pretty amazing find,” Meachen said. 
Then came the logistics.  
“We all kind of were like, ‘What are we going to do about this?’” she said. “Because the mammoth is a giant thing.”

The researchers can only access the cave by rappelling in, meaning any fossils found must exit by a pulley system. In the event a pesky reporter asks to shadow the group for a day of digging, they, too, are required to learn and use the ropes.
Little by little, Meachen said, the researchers dug through thick clay and got out as many fossils as they could before the 2025 season ended. 
“For the people of Wyoming, I think it’s really cool for them to understand their prehistoric heritage and what animals were there before the end of the last Ice Age.”

Surely Sen. Lummis, an attorney who took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, one whose congressional ancestors crafted the language she now seeks to unwind, understands the implications of greenlighting limitations of speech. 
The post Tone it down, senator. There is no fire in this theater. appeared first on WyoFile .","I did two things when I heard Sen. Cynthia Lummis was floating the idea of tinkering with the Constitution, downgrading the free speech clause of the First Amendment to a murky halfway house of kinda-sorta constitutional rights. 

Opinion

First, I checked the Wyoming State Bar to see whether she was licensed to practice law. 
Then I grieved.
In the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and a poorly timed monologue by late night TV comedian Jimmy Kimmel, Sen. Lummis stated she no longer considered speech under the First Amendment a guarantee. 
Surely the senator, an attorney who took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, one whose congressional ancestors crafted the language she now seeks to unwind, understands the implications of greenlighting limitations of speech. 
Kimmel’s Sept. 15th monologue mocked President Trump, questioning the depth of Trump’s grief. It was terrible and cruel. It was also the exact type of language the First Amendment protects. That’s the point. We do not become uneasy with free speech until we are outraged.  
Under the First Amendment, we can be provocative, we can say uncomfortable things, we can create works of art that make us squirm and challenge our belief systems, we give voice to the vile and despicable, the lewd and profane. 
We can choose to look or ignore, not because the government restricted our access to such expression, but because our democracy gives us agency. We are free to look away. Better yet, we are free to debate, to dialogue with our opponents. Just like Charlie Kirk did.  
Yet, Lummis told Semafor, a digital news site, “Under normal times . . . I tend to think that the First Amendment should always be sort of the ultimate right. And that there should be almost no checks and balances on it. I don’t feel that way anymore. I feel like something’s changed culturally. And I think that there needs to be some cognizance that things have changed.”
Speak more to this, senator. Who gets to decide what are “normal times”?  Walk us through the criteria for re-routing the First Amendment simply to conform to this fevered moment? Justify your turnabout from 2023, when you introduced the “Free Speech Protection Act” under the Biden administration, which sought to expand the very thing you now want to limit. 
I do not buy the argument that this time is different. Agreed, political violence — the rapidity of which is alarming — is on the rise. Yet,  I remain unconvinced Lummis’ menacing statement was made for the good of the order, rather than for the supplicating promise of power or pandering to a grieving and skittish base. 
Historian David McCullough reminded us there has never been a simple time in our history. Each generation carries its burden of crisis and conflict, charlatans and heroes, and an ugly catalog of political violence.  
Over a third of the presidents in the 20th century experienced assassination attempts, two of them were killed, according to PolitiFact. In the first half of the 20th century, during the Jim Crow era, ordinary citizens, especially Black Americans, were regularly lynched. The 1960s and 1970s experienced a dramatic rise in political violence when President John F. Kennedy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy and George Wallace were shot. President Trump himself has been the target of two assassination attempts.
Let’s not forget the violence of the Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol where, as described in the Jan 6th report, Oath Keeper Leader Steward Rhodes amassed an arsenal of military-grade assault weapons, spent approximately $7,000 on two night-vision devices and a weapon sight, an additional $6,000 on an AR-style rifle, and firearms attachments. Yet, I recall no efforts to downgrade speech in response to those actions.   
There are strategies to consider before we dicker with our founding documents. Quit re-posting the hate. Block the nutjobs. Don’t take the bait. Lock the gun cabinet. Do we really need to iron fist this moment above which we may rise?  
Raising political candidates is like having children. Our state loves and nurtures them. We see the promise in them. We grow and support them and happily send them out to the big wide world to represent us. Once launched, we hope they become someone to which the rest of the country aspires so that we can boast “look what noble statesmen we produced, this visionary, one with a keen intellect who sees beyond the gloomy horizon. You’re welcome.” 
But we do not live in times of statesmanship, and Sen. Lummis is not that. 
May this unnormal time be different, may we place people in positions of power with a steady hand, those who learn from history, its missteps and mistakes.  
Lummis’ statements were a knee jerk response to a lightening charged environment, one which gave license to the idea we can restrict language just because we don’t like it.  Her comments were reactionary, irresponsible and dangerous. 
Kind of like crying “fire!” in a crowded theater.

County budgets shouldn’t depend on ICE immigration efforts, writes Antonio Serrano.
The post Why Wyoming sheriffs shouldn’t take dollars for detainees appeared first on WyoFile .","To some, she’s a mother. A friend. A co-worker. A neighbor. 
But to Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp, she’s also a potential source of revenue. 

Opinion

That’s because for every immigrant detained by ICE agents and held in the Uinta County Jail, Kopp’s department gets paid $66 a day — barely enough to cover his costs, but he’s hoping to increase that to $120 a day — and he’s banking on detaining enough immigrants to collect $500,000 per year. By doing this, Kopp is putting a price on immigrants and is sending a clear message about how he and other law enforcement officials see the immigrant community — with dollar signs in their eyes.
Kopp has earmarked this money to give his deputies a raise — the Wyoming Legislature’s property tax cuts left the county with less revenue for salary increases. But immigrants didn’t raise the cost of food. Immigrants didn’t raise the cost of housing. And immigrants aren’t the ones creating hardships for working-class Wyomingites. (If you need a scapegoat, you should be looking at some of our elected officials and the wealthy people who support them.)
But Kopp and a growing number of other Wyoming sheriffs are now paid jailers for the Trump administration’s deportation machine. Making local government dependent on the federal government’s immigration system and the promise of a steady stream of detained immigrants is a dangerous game to play.
You see, while some Wyoming sheriffs have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, effectively turning local officials into ICE agents, Kopp has not yet. But his arrangement provides a more direct financial incentive to collaborate with federal immigration enforcement — and that poses significant threats to immigrant communities and the foundational principles of justice in Wyoming.

That’s because most people ICE arrested this year in Wyoming did not have a criminal history, according to data obtained from ICE, published by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by The Colorado Sun and WyoFile. The ICE arrest data contradicts the purported goals of the Trump administration to target the “worst of the worst.”
But this is not just about undocumented immigrants. This is about every immigrant in Wyoming — citizen, resident or otherwise — who now has to wonder if going to work, speaking Spanish or some other language, or just trying to exist in Wyoming makes them a target. And if the history and current reality of racial profiling in this country and here in Wyoming tells us anything, it’s that law enforcement will almost always lean on the “easiest” factor — skin color, accent or language — when making arrests. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary ruling earlier this month allowing federal immigration enforcement to use profiling to decide who to stop and detain. 
Most of us can agree that the federal government needs to do much better on immigration policy and identify real solutions that are orderly, humane and fair. But turning local law enforcement into an extension of the federal government is none of those things. Rather, it puts officers and their communities at risk and depletes much-needed resources.
Local law enforcement agencies that willingly carry out the business of the federal government are losing vital community support and trust while diminishing their efforts to improve public safety. Community policing, after all, works best when law enforcement has the trust and cooperation of its constituents. However, this cooperation is easily eroded when communities believe they cannot safely disclose criminal activity to local law enforcement for fear of deportation or imprisonment or that they may be the subject of racial or ethnic profiling. We warned lawmakers this would happen, but our warnings were not taken seriously and ignored.
Safer communities should not come at the expense of our immigrant friends and family. County budgets shouldn’t depend on detaining immigrants. Immigrant families are part of our communities, our congregations, our schools and our workplaces. Treating them as enemies to be rounded up and detained for dollars is unacceptable. Local authorities like Sheriff Kopp have no business contributing to that effort.
Uinta County and Wyoming stood up against immigration detention in the past, and we will do it again. Immigrants belong in Wyoming, and we’ll never stop fighting for them.

Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada once said his goal was to elect a Republican in all 95 House districts. Holding a supermajority wasn’t enough.
More than six years later, Casada is focused instead on staying out of prison after being sentenced to three years for his role in a fraudulent money laundering and kickback scheme involving his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who was sentenced to two and a half years. The duo ran a  secretive consulting firm called Phoenix Solution that tapped into a state-funded mailing program and then the Republican Caucus and House campaigns, kicking money back to Casada and former state Rep. Robin Smith.
Casada, a Franklin Republican, retired from office three years ago, staying one term after he stepped down from the speaker’s post amid pressure from fellow Republicans. He received no support at his sentencing hearing from the lawmakers he helped elect and put in leadership positions.
Casada seemingly had the Tennessee political world under his thumb as House Republican Caucus chairman and then majority leader, dishing out money to favored candidates who ran on an ultra-conservative platform in 2018. He parlayed that year’s victories into votes for the speakership, and after winning the powerful seat, formed new committees and rewarded Republicans and even a couple of Democrats with chairmanships to cement his control.
But the honeymoon didn’t last long. 
Complaints started flowing within the ranks about “hall monitors” who policed chit-chat at the Cordell Hull Building and reported to Casada. Then there were the “bill kill” lists that targeted even the legislation of fellow Republicans, and other forms of heavy-handed leadership, including hiring a political operative who went after Casada enemies but didn’t have to report to work. Lawmakers weren’t enthused either with Cothren’s $200,000 salary or the way the staffer tried to strong-arm votes during the final push to pass Gov. Bill Lee’s 2019 private-school voucher program. The plan provides funds to low-income students in Memphis and Nashville, and now Chattanooga, to enroll in private schools but is seen by critics as the beginning of the end of public schools.
Following a tie vote in April 2019, Casada held the vote board open for nearly 45 minutes to work the chamber for a tie-breaker. He was accused of calling Lee’s office while out on the House balcony that day to ask for a general’s rank in the Tennessee National Guard for former Democratic Rep. John Mark Windle in an effort to win his vote. Casada later denied making the request.
Then again, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson pointed out during this week’s sentencing hearing that Casada lied to FBI agents when they raided his home early on Jan. 8, 2021.
Casada was bent on delivering for the governor, and even though he brought in the votes, allegations started to fly and the FBI took notice, if it wasn’t already digging in on Capitol Hill.
A racist and sexist texting scandal engulfed Cothren and Casada shortly after the voucher vote, worsened by Cothren’s admission that he’d used cocaine in state offices, another strike against him that was brought up in sentencing two weeks ago. 
The duo had been feeding off each other as they partied in Nashville during those halcyon days, Cothren helping Casada relive his early years and Casada giving Cothren a modicum of authority as a 30-something. Cothren was even named one of the city’s most eligible bachelors by a local publication.
Suddenly, Cothren found himself forced out, and Casada was left to fend for himself.
He didn’t fare well when the Republican Caucus took a vote of no-confidence at a Nashville boutique hotel where a creepy penguin stood in a hallway and pictures of naked half-humans, half-bears hung on the wall.
When Casada emerged from the building that day in August 2019, he seemed dazed and confused. 
But what ensued turned out to be worse than setting the record for shortest speakership in modern history, about eight months. He left the office only after the governor said he would call a special session to find a new speaker.
Ultimately, that turned out to be Rep. Cameron Sexton of Crossville who also worked his way through the Republican ranks. Cothren would later claim he helped Sexton win support, saying phone records showed they communicated regularly, little of which came out in the Cothren-Casada trial this spring.
Casada continued to serve, even winning another two-year term. But he was a shell of his political self.
When FBI agents showed up at his Franklin door, he tried to play off any knowledge or association with Phoenix Solutions, though he admitted that Cothren had to keep his role in the company secret because lawmakers wouldn’t do business with him and Smith if they knew the former chief of staff was involved.

As federal prosecutor John Taddei said during the Tuesday sentencing hearing, “When the FBI confronted them, Mr. Cothren deflected and minimized; Mr. Casada straight up lied.”
After resigning, Cothren found himself having to replace a hefty paycheck, so he, Smith and Casada hatched the idea for Phoenix Solutions. It would go first for the constituent mailer program that Smith described as “low-hanging fruit” when she testified for federal prosecutors in their four-week trial.
It all went well at first, as most shady enterprises do. Lawmakers such as former Rep. Kent Calfee, whom Smith disrespected, Rep. Paul Sherrell, Rep. Jay Reedy, and former House finance chair Patsy Hazlewood unwittingly did business with Phoenix, not knowing that “Matthew Phoenix” was a fictitious character cobbled together by Cothren.
They brought in a relative pittance, about $52,000, ran it through Smith’s and Casada’s own consulting firms, and kicked part of the money back to the two lawmakers. Then they went for House Republican Caucus money and campaigns, netting about $159,000.
In May 2020, if not earlier, folks started getting suspicious, and the FBI stepped in. Connie Ridley, former director of Legislative Administration, whom Smith and Casada pushed to cut checks to Phoenix Solutions, started requiring all House vendors to fill out federal W-9 forms. Cothren signed the document as “Matthew Phoenix.” 
They were indicted Aug. 23, 2022. Smith agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, but Cothren and Casada held out, continuing to proclaim they’d done nothing wrong. In fact, a recent voice mail by Casada in which he continued to maintain he’d been running a perfectly legal business came back to haunt him during sentencing.
Only his wife, daughter and Sunday school teacher testified as character witnesses for him, with daughter Sarah Hoos saying that he’d become a better father since his downfall.
Just as Casada wasn’t satisfied with having Republicans in 75 seats in the House, giving them an overwhelming supermajority after decades of Democratic control, he always seemed to be looking for something else, another power lunch, another arm to twist, more authority.
In the end, that lust for control caused him to fall into perilous water, costing him his marriage and job. He told the Lookout before his arrest that he had found a new spiritual life. One wonders, though, if he could ever really surrender.
Out of leftfield
Casada defense attorney Ed Yarbro told the judge this week that his client had suffered enough at the hands of the “left-wing media” in requesting a light sentence, nothing but probation.
The problem: That argument didn’t hold up, even before a judge appointed by President Donald Trump.
Casada was ousted from the speakership by Republican lawmakers and a Republican governor, and Smith, a former Tennessee Republican Party chair, testified against him in return for a lesser punishment.  
None of the Republican lawmakers he helped came to his rescue either during sentencing – not one kind word. 
A former Republican political operative also provided the information that led to the scandal surrounding Cothren and Casada and their demise. 
The “left-wing media” didn’t have to manufacture anything, which is usually the case in political corruption. The powerful, regardless of political persuasion, write the ending to their own stories.
Polish your surfboards
State Rep. Todd Warner, a Cothren supporter, is drawing a bit of fire for blasting rock on his property in Marshall County for a 35-acre lake, according to a Tennessee Journal report.
Warner apparently started work on the lake without a permit before applying for a national water quality discharge permit. The lake will pull from the Duck River, which is caught up in a battle between development and protection.
A complaint shows the site is being used to mine limestone and that a portable crusher is on the site. Warner was notified that he needed a pollution discharge permit, which initially wasn’t required by the state because of a misunderstanding about how the property was being used, according to the report.
Warner told the Tennessee Journal he’s being targeted by “political adversaries” and added that the lake will be used for agricultural purposes only. He declined to speak on the record to the Lookout, citing the advice of his attorneys.
A zoning hearing is set for Sept. 30.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor) North Dakota’s agriculture commissioner warned lawmakers this week that federal trade and health policies are exacerbating concerns of farmers already worried about low ag commodity prices and high production costs.
In order to keep up, the average farm in North Dakota is borrowing 12 to 20 times more than the  average farm did in the 1980s, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said. 
“We’ll have to ride through this and see what happens,” Goehring told members of a legislative committee on Wednesday. 
North Dakota soybean growers anxiously await sales to China 

That borrowing could be a ticking time bomb, according to Rep. Mike Brandenburg, a Republican from Edgeley who also is a farmer. The lawmaker said farmers are “going to work really hard, take the crop out, and lose some money again” this year. Then this winter “bankers are going to put the squeeze on” any farmers who owe money and don’t have equity, he said. 
“That’s when things are going to fall apart,” Brandenburg said.
Brandenburg expects farmers will have to make “hard decisions” this winter if they don’t have equity. Even if they don’t lose the farm, they may be forced to sell off some land or rent it out to make up for a shortfall with what they’ve borrowed from the bank, he said.
Trade impacts
Most of the world is producing a record amount of ag commodities like soybeans and corn. But the agriculture commissioner said there’s still a deficit in some parts of the world. 
“We still have quite a deficit for commodities and food in the eastern hemisphere, which means that we’ll continue to try and do as much business as we can given policies and trade issues,” Goehring said.
The biggest barrier to that is the federal government’s trade policy and tariffs. A trade deal with China, traditionally a major customer for North Dakota’s soybean production, is being held up for non-trade reasons according to Goehring. 
“It’s more political than anything else,” he said. 
Goehring told lawmakers that farmers’ breakeven prices for soybeans are usually around $10.32, corn is around $3.80 and wheat can break even at $6. But those commodities are only fetching $8.65 for soybeans, $1.60 for corn, and $4.70 for wheat. And the prices for soybeans can be deceptive. 
“In some cases, elevators have said they won’t take anything because they don’t have a home for it,” Goehring said of soybeans. 
One contributor to the low prices are the tariffs President Donald Trump has implemented against countries across the world, including several customers for North Dakota’s ag products. 
“The ag community is trying to be patient and they’re looking at this and saying ‘yes, we need fair trade deals,’” Goehring said. “But at some point, rubber meets the road and they owe their creditors and they owe the bank.”
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., on Wednesday met with a group of North Dakota farmers and ag industry professionals. 
She said in an interview there are negotiations taking place in Congress to provide some short-term help for farmers, perhaps through tariff revenue, to get them through the winter financially. 
Goehring isn’t sure financial relief from the federal government will be enough. 
“I don’t know if you can write a big enough check through the federal government to cover losses,” he said. 
In addition to a lack of exports, Fedorchak and Goehring said farmers also are concerned about the cost of inputs like fertilizer. China is a major supplier of fertilizer. 
MAHA’s ‘attack’  on North Dakota ag
A growing issue for North Dakota’s agriculture industry, Goehring said, is the Make America Healthy Again movement championed by national figures like Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“They’ve now turned their attention to attack seed oils,” Goehring said.

North Dakota is a leading producer of sunflowers and canola, which are used to make some of the oils the MAHA movement opposes.
Goehring said Kennedy and others at the forefront of the MAHA movement have been pushing the use of animal fats like butter instead and have made disparaging comments about food and agriculture. 
“You can’t trust them anymore,” Goehring said. “Above everything else, we live in the United States of America. We have embraced choices in agriculture and food, in our lifestyles, for decades. For centuries. Now all of a sudden we have people who want to dictate and pull that freedom away.”

Amin has headed the program for nearly a year. (Photo courtesy of Help4WV)Help4WV, the state’s only 24/7 call line for people struggling with substance use disorder and mental health, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, marking 10 years of assisting individuals and families affected by addiction in West Virginia.

Salwa Amin, program director for the helpline, said over that time employees who staff it have helped connect thousands of people to recovery services, support those struggling with a mental health episode, educate family members on how they can assist their loved ones who have substance use disorder and more.
“It is kind of incredible to think about how far [Help4WV] has been able to come in a decade’s time,” Amin said.
Help4WV — which is run through First Choice Services — actually launched before 2015, said Sheila Moran, director of marketing and communications for First Choice Services. Back then, though, the program was different and not nearly as wide reaching.
Because of the way it was funded, until 2015 the line could only be used to help people who were living with addiction related to prescription drugs.
“Back then, if there was a call because of someone using alcohol, marijuana, [struggling with] mental health, really any other drugs outside of prescription pills, we couldn’t do anything. In 2015 — that’s when we really started to become the [helpline] that we are today,” Moran said. “I think that happened at a really important time. There was so much more going on, so much more that people were struggling with and we wanted to help.”
Since its launch, Moran said she’s seen several changes in the addiction and recovery environment. The number of available treatment beds and programs has grown, meaning more options for people looking to enter recovery. There are more services — like medically assisted treatment and opioid treatment programs — available to refer people to. Overall, and while there’s still much work remaining, there is more of a willingness to see addiction as a disease instead of a moral failing today than 10 years ago, Moran said.
“We’ve come a long way in just 10 years. The work is not all done, clearly, but it is a different environment today,” Moran said. “I think that does make me hopeful for what the next 10 years could look like.”
The organization partners with hundreds of other entities all across West Virginia — detox centers, recovery and rehabilitation homes, medically assisted treatment facilities and more — to ensure callers are connected with the services they need wherever and whenever they need them. 
Amin, who has headed the program for almost a year now, said those types of connections are critical but just a part of what call line workers do.
Another crucial part to the work, she said, is making sure people who call feel heard and are really connecting with the person on the other end of the line.
“That connection is a critical part of the work we do. It’s hard to get someone help if you don’t take the time to listen, and that’s what our employees really focus on — understanding someone’s whole story so they have a better understanding of what kind of help would be best at that particular time,” Amin said. “We really focus on that, and we’re proud that we operate from a very human-first approach.”
Nearly every person who works taking calls on the Help4WV line has lived experience with addiction and is in long-term recovery themselves. Amin said this experience allows call-takers to have a particular understanding of how someone who is calling in could be feeling.
“They actually know what someone means when they say they’re having a bad day, or if they call in and say they’ve relapsed,” Amin said. “A lot of people — when they call us, they are in a really dark place. They could be at their lowest point. It’s important that, at that point, they’re not being judged or feeling attacked. They can know that whoever they’re talking to has likely been in a similar situation before, and that on its own helps.”
Moran said an overarching philosophy at Help4WV is making every call as personal as it can be. While it’s operated 24/7, workers are committed to keeping wait times as low as possible. Callers aren’t diverted through phone trees or other automated messages. The first voice they hear, Moran said, is always a human one.
Call traffic can fluctuate throughout the day, as well. It tends to be heavier in mornings and afternoons and, sometimes, evening hours. Over night, call load may shrink, Moran said, but sometimes those calls are the most critical.
Most importantly, said Amin, someone will be there at any time a call is made.
“We’re always going to be fully staffed, ready to take just one call or take 10,” Amin said. “That’s crucial to the services we’re offering and the people who rely on us.”
Amin is in long-term recovery from addiction herself. She said she remembers what it felt like, before she entered recovery, to not know where to turn if she did want help. Now, she said, she doesn’t want anyone to feel they have to navigate that situation alone.
Callers can help find treatment and detox beds for individuals in any part of the state. If someone is looking for a support group meeting, they can tell them the closest one. And if people need help getting to services, call-takers can set them up with programs that offer free transportation.
While most of the callers are calling for themselves, Amin said it’s not unusual for family members to reach out and ask questions on how to support their loved ones.
“Parents will call asking how to help their children and vice versa. There’s not one type of person that calls our line, and there’s not just one type of service that can help them,” Amin said. “That’s why we really make the effort to hear everything they’re willing to share.”
Nothing is forced upon people who call. Call-takers might make suggestions, Amin said, but any action taken is decided upon wholly by the person seeking help. 
Amin and Moran both said they feel hopeful over the state’s recent progress in lowering the rate of fatal drug overdoses. They hope that progress persists and becomes a continued trend to slow what has been a devastating epidemic in West Virginia in beyond.
Amin said those at Help4WV are proud to contribute to this work whenever and however possible.
“We’ve lost so, so many people — too many people — to this epidemic. Even while I’m happy to see that maybe we are starting to turn things around, we’re still losing too many people,” Amin said. “If we’re able to connect even one person to help, to make them feel heard and seen and realize that there is help, then we want to do that. We want to do that for anyone who needs it.”

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) The Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee this week approved on a 4-2 vote a $2.8 million supplemental budget request from the Colorado Department of Corrections to add 153 more private prison beds. 
The additional funding will go to the department even though it is also required to make an extra effort to reduce its inmate population. The provisions of a 2018 law in August were triggered for the first time after the state prisons’ vacancy rate had been below 3% for more than 30 consecutive days. Those conditions under the law require the department to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population.
Criminal justice reform advocates as well as Democratic leaders of both the state House and Senate judiciary committees wrote to the Joint Budget Committee earlier this month urging members to vote against the DOC’s budget request, citing the department’s limited efforts to efficiently reduce the prison population as the 2018 law requires.

The advocate letter, led by the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition and signed by 72 other organizations that make up the No More Prisons coalition, said the budget request is based on a projected increase in the male prison population but “ignores DOC’s own role in driving prison bed demand.” 
“Before funding more beds, there should be scrutiny of whether DOC is doing all it can within its control to reduce demand for more prison beds,” the letter says. 
Christie Donner, executive director of the CCJRC, said the lawmakers failed “to ask the harder questions” about the department’s population management efforts, noting that there have been several recent state audits that found the department could implement efficiencies and better practices for its budget and security classification system. 
“Our whole point is, hold the department to a higher standard of performance instead of just giving them more beds,” Donner said. “The Department of Corrections is in this weird situation where the worse they do, the more money they get.”
The letter CCJRC led calls for an independent audit of DOC policies around transitioning people in custody to parole and back into their communities. Donner said that’s where she sees “a lot of the breakdown and bogginess” in the department. For example, some prisoners will go to a parole board hearing before they have an approved parole plan. 
Donner also said that the department’s funding for programming does not automatically increase as the population increases — so the more people there are in custody, the less capacity the department has to offer programming. 










The Department of Corrections is in this weird situation where the worse they do, the more money they get.


– Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition


The Judiciary Committee letter said the JBC should deny the budget request because the prison population management measures should be given more time to work before the state spends unbudgeted tax dollars on more prison beds, “especially in the context of the state’s present, severe fiscal constraints.”
The committee’s letter also said DOC should better use community corrections beds and reform its classification system, because the vacancies in lower security beds are much higher than others and could be better used. 
“Approval of yet another supplemental request for more beds under the existing methodologies amounts to doubling down on admittedly failed practices,” the letter says. 
Justin Brakke, a legislative budget and policy analyst, told the JBC Monday that the DOC could use the newly funded beds to address the backlog of people sentenced to prison who are held in county jails. He said the state budgets for just over 250 people to be temporarily held in county jails, but the backlog is closer to 500 people right now.
DOC spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez-Garcia said the supplemental funding “complements” its use of prison population management measures to maximize capacity and “maintain safe, secure, and appropriately staffed bed space” amid the growing prison population. 
“The Colorado Department of Corrections has a dual responsibility: to effectively manage our current population using all available tools, including population management measures, and to ensure we have the capacity to safely house all individuals sentenced to our custody by the courts,” Gonzalez-Garcia said in a statement.

Members of the JBC were in agreement that they do not want to see the department use the new beds to artificially inflate vacancy rates, and that any additional funding requests related to beds would be denied if they are not used to reduce the jail backlog. Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, and Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, voted in support of the request, while Sen. Judy Amanile, a Boulder Democrat, and Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, voted against it. 
Amabile said she doesn’t want to “just keep approving more beds” because that means there is “no pressure on the system to actually make the reforms that need to be made.” She said she doesn’t want “dangerous people” to be released from custody, but that the state has many in custody who do not pose a risk to the public, and she wants to see progress on releasing them. 
“I want us to be smart about public safety, because the thing that will make us the safest is making sure that we are rehabilitating people, that we are doing everything we can to get the people who are going to be released ready to be released and setting them up for success,” Amabile said.  
People in custody who are older and sick cost the state more money as it has to pay for their health care, Amabile said, and moving them into nursing homes where they could be covered by Medicaid or Medicare would save the state money. 
The waitlist for the state’s sex offender treatment program, which is required for some people with indeterminate sentences to be eligible for parole, has a long backlog too, Amabile said, and people are still in prison after they are eligible for parole just because they have not received the treatment. The state is subject to a class action lawsuit because of peoples’ inability to access the required treatment program. 
Technical parole violations have also significantly increased the prison population, and Amabile said there may be better options to address those violations instead of automatically sending someone back to prison. Donner said parole revocation is the largest driver of the growing prison population. 
Colorado is in an increasingly tight budget environment due to rising program costs and a slowing economy, as well as the federal tax cut and spending bill Congress passed earlier this year that reduced income tax revenue in the state. Supplemental funding approved by the JBC comes from the state’s reserves, or savings, and will need to be accounted for when the state prepares its budget next year, potentially affecting other state funding for programs like Medicaid and K-12 education, Amabile said. 
In the budget for the current fiscal year, state legislators originally reduced the number of beds in the DOC by 300, but the department asked for more in a June supplemental request and then again in September. Donner said she anticipates the department will continue to request supplemental funding for more beds and in the next fiscal year’s budget too, so it will be “a big issue” in the 2026 legislative session.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Once again Idaho state Rep. Wendy Horman, the chief proponent for voucher subsidies for private schools, has not spent enough time reading the Idaho Constitution. 
Responding to a lawsuit against House Bill 93, which provides $50 million in voucher subsidies to private schools, Horman told the media that she is confident the Idaho Supreme Court will rule against the plaintiffs.

“If constitutionality is their main concern, we welcome that argument and welcome the opportunity to prove how this is constitutional,” according to Idaho Education News.
Further, she said that if the voucher subsidy is unconstitutional, so is the popular Idaho Launch program. That program provides state funding for students to attend postsecondary education.
Here’s the problem with Horman’s thinking.
She seems to assume that the lawsuit against House Bill 93 is based on a violation of Article 9, Section 5 of the Idaho Constitution which prohibits the state from using taxpayer dollars – or in this case dollars diverted from the state general fund – to pay for religious school tuition. But she is wrong. The lawsuit filed this week is not based upon that prohibition. 
Instead, the plaintiff’s lawsuit is based on Article 9, Section 1 of the Idaho Constitution. That section makes it clear that the Legislature’s constitutional mandate is to “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” 
The lawsuit points out that private schools are not general, uniform, thorough, free, common or open to all students. There is not even a hint in the Constitution that the taxpayers can or must finance any type of education besides Idaho’s public schools.
The plaintiffs include the Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution; Mormon Women for Ethical Government; the Moscow School District; Republican Rep. Stephanie Michelsen of Idaho Falls; Kristine Anderson, mother of students with special needs in the Madison School District;  Marta Hernandez, a member of the Idaho Education Association and educator at Burley Junior High; Alexis Morgan, an Idaho parent; and former Republican State School Superintendent Jerry Evans, who served from 1979 to 1995. 
“Using taxpayer funds, House Bill 93 created a governmental system contrary to the constitution that is not general, uniform, thorough, or free,” according to Shawn Tiegs, superintendent of the Moscow School District, which voted to join the suit at a special meeting this week. “We support ample and appropriate school choice through public charters and other avenues that also protect the rights of every student to receive a quality public education. We must keep the real choice with students and families — not with a private entity or organization that excludes students at taxpayer expense.”
Advocacy coalition files lawsuit to block Idaho’s new private school tax credit

Parent and plaintiff Alexis Morgan’s child was denied admittance to a private religious school on religious grounds. Morgan told a press conference on Wednesday, “I am standing here in defense of public education. Our constitutional framers knew that public education is vital for Idaho to thrive.”
It seems that Rep. Horman does not see that the lawsuit makes the case that the Legislature is not currently meeting its constitutional mandate to adequately fund a “uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.”
As co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee Rep. Horman should know that Idaho ranks last in the country on how much it spends on public education. She should also be aware that there is a backlog of more than $1 billion in public school facility improvements across the state. She has probably read the Legislature’s Office of Performance Evaluations report that says there is a $82 million funding gap for special needs students. She should also know that most school districts across the state need their property taxpayers to pick up the shortfall caused by the lack of state funding from the Legislature.
Let’s make it clear – the Idaho Constitution does not give local property taxpayers the burden of establishing and funding their public schools. Rather the Constitution gives that mandate to lawmakers like Rep. Horman.
In short, Rep. Horman’s budget committee and the Idaho Legislature are not currently meeting their constitutional mandate to fund our public schools.
Furthermore, the Constitution does not give the Legislature any authority to fund private schools. If the state’s founders favored funding private schools, with zero accountability on how taxpayers’ dollars are spent, they would have clearly addressed it in the Idaho Constitution. 
Aside from being unconstitutional, school vouchers are unpopular with the public. In the 2023 legislative session, Rep. Horman opposed House Bill 339, which called for an advisory vote of the people on school vouchers in the 2024 general election. Rep. Mickelsen relates in her affidavit supporting the HB 93 lawsuit that Horman told her at the time that voters would reject vouchers. The 32,336 pleas that Gov. Brad Little received from the public this year to veto House Bill 93 speaks volumes.
For the record, here is exactly what the state’s founders wrote in the Idaho Constitution: “The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.”
It can’t get any clearer than that.

More than 500,000 low- and moderate-income Tennesseans rely on the enhanced tax credits, which significantly lower the cost of insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.
Without the credits, rising health insurance premiums are expected to price millions out of health coverage and shift the burden for providing uncompensated care to hospitals, which by law are required to provide certain medical services regardless of whether insurance will cover them.
In Tennessee, demand for uncompensated care could rise by 29.2% or $378 million beginning in 2026 if the tax credits expire, an analysis by the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found. The analysis noted that rural communities could see the biggest financial hits from a surge in uninsured residents. Currently nine rural hospitals in Tennessee are at risk for closure.
Tennessee is among 15 states that would experience the largest increases in uncompensated care. Nine of these states, including Tennessee, have not expanded Medicaid.  
The enhanced subsidies were put in place in 2021 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic . Extending the subsidies has been a key source of contention in Congress’s current budget negotiations..
The Republican-controlled U.S. House passed a seven-week spending bill last week that didn’t include a continuation of the Affordable Care Act Marketplace tax enhancements. Democrats in the U.S. Senate have refused to provide the votes necessary to overcome the 60-vote filibuster to pass it.
Instead, Democrats have proposed a four-week funding measure that would permanently keep the tax credits in place.
Without a bipartisan agreement to avert a government shutdown by Sept. 30, the subsidies will come to an end.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentuckians stand to lose more years off their lives due to power plant emissions than residents of almost any other state, according to a first of its kind national report released Thursday. 
In the Commonwealth Fund’s State Scorecard on Climate and Health, researchers ranked Kentucky as 50th overall among the 50 states and District of Columbia for health impacts of electricity generation emissions, flood risk posed to health care facilities, energy efficiency policies, health sector greenhouse gas emissions and more. Only West Virginia ranked lower.
Michael Seilback, the nationwide advocacy and state public policy expert at the American Lung Association, said the pollution in Kentucky’s air contributes to asthma attacks, lung cancers and premature death.

“When we turn on a light switch, we don’t often think about where that energy is coming from,” Seilback told the Lantern. “And what we’re talking about here is that these power plants that are fueled from coal — the burning of that coal to produce energy produces massive amounts of emissions.”
Kentucky’s longstanding loyalty to coal is “a major contributor to the state’s poor grade” in this report, Seilback said. About 68% of Kentucky’s electricity generation came from coal in 2023, the third-largest share among the states after West Virginia and Wyoming, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
“Often we think about how much energy you’re using in your house, and that’s relevant, but the question is, ‘where is that energy coming from?’” Seilback said. “If you were able to say all of Kentucky was being powered through wind, solar, hydropower, there would be less of a concern about using electricity because you weren’t producing all those emissions.”  
This report “should be another data point for decision makers to say ‘we really need to move away from fossil fuels and towards green energy, which will improve the health of Kentucky residents,’” Seilback said. 
Cabinet for Health and Family Services data shows 12,266 people visited emergency departments in Kentucky for asthma treatment in 2024. There were more than 1,000 hospitalizations, as well, and 34 deaths related to asthma that same year. Air pollution can cause asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, as well as worsen its symptoms. 
“The exposure to these pollutants are literally shortening people’s lives,” Seilback said. 
Kentucky has the nation’s highest rates of cancer and lung cancer.
GOP attorneys general dispute climate science, urge end to greenhouse gas regs

Among the eight indicators on which each state was evaluated, Kentucky ranked best on risks facing health care facilities from natural hazards, defined as vulnerability of health care facilities to natural hazards. “On average, health care facilities in Kentucky are located in areas facing less risk from natural hazards than facilities in other states,” the report states.
At the same time, Kentucky’s  number of inpatient beds in high-hazard flood zones significantly raises the flood risk to the state’s health care facilities, according to the report.
Hawaii ranked worst on health harms from electricity generation, the report said, because of the islands’ high use of petroleum to generate power. Kentucky and West Virginia ranked next worst. The researchers quantified health effects of power plant pollution by using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) — described as “a common measure of the burden of disease, representing years of healthy life lost” — to calculate “the standardized health burden for every unit of electricity generated.”
“In Kentucky, emissions from electricity generation result in more negative health impacts per unit of electricity than in other states,” the report says. “Negative health impacts are represented by years of healthy life lost.” 
The commonwealth is joined by Louisiana and West Virginia as the worst-ranked states overall, meaning they “face more frequent and intense hazards and lack supportive energy and environmental policies.” 
The highest ranking states in the report are Vermont, New York and Washington, meaning those states “have lower environmental risk and vulnerability as well as stronger decarbonization and clean energy policies.” 
Dr. Joseph R. Betancourt, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement that “I hope this scorecard inspires states to learn from one another’s efforts to reduce pollution, prepare for environmental risks, and better protect people’s health.”
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

“As a physician, I have seen firsthand how closely the environment and health are linked,” Betancourt said. “People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather.” 
Calls to action for Kentucky and beyond 
The Commonwealth Fund, founded in 1918, is a private foundation seeking to improve the country’s health care system through independent research and grantmaking. The report recommends a series of policies for states and health systems to consider. They include: 

Prioritize decarbonizing energy sources and improving efficiency, through mechanisms like renewable portfolio standards and updated building energy codes, to reduce emissions and protect public health.
Set health care decarbonization goals and incentivize performance improvement through payment reforms in Medicaid as well as private and employer insurance.
Require standardized, verified and transparent reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, strategic planning, and mitigation targets by health care facilities and their suppliers.
Prioritize building resilience to extreme weather; expand public health investment in relief centers and early warning systems, especially in high-risk areas.
Assign executive-level sustainability responsibility and employ designated leaders at each health care facility.
Collect and report sustainability and resilience data in areas prioritized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and The Joint Commission.
Purchase reusable and environmentally preferable products and champion waste reduction and clean energy.

Seilback, with the Lung Association, said the Trump administration’s moves to undo “many air quality protections” have put more responsibility on states to act. 
“Without a strong federal government, we really need state and local bodies to step up,” he said. “We want to see more investments in the wide range of cleaner, greener technologies.”

Nearly a month after school leaders demanded greater transparency, the State Board of Education voted Thursday to support raising the benchmarks — or cut scores — for math and English, setting off a debate over how the changes will affect classrooms.
The decision to raise the cut scores, which determine whether K-12 students meet proficiency standards — has been a priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. The goal is to align Virginia’s benchmarks with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a move officials say will help students develop deeper problem-solving skills. 
Youngkin’s appointed Board of Education is weighing concerns from education leaders who warn the changes could harm equitable access,contribute to teacher burnout, and lower graduation rates. The current cut scores for math and English were set in 2016 and 2017.
“We’re measuring today’s proficiency expectations using outdated benchmarks,” said Board of Education President Grace Creasey. “Approving new cut scores are necessary to reflect proficiency expectations for mastery of our more rigorous 2023 mathematics and 2024 English standards.”
On Thursday, the board endorsed the recommendation by Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson and the standards setting committee to raise the cut scores, capping off a yearslong process that included adopting tougher academic standards in 2023 and 2024 and aligning state assessments.
The initiative is part of Youngkin’s push to close the “honesty gap,” the disparity between Virginia’s proficiency standards and NAEP benchmarks, which often show students performing worse on the national exam than on state tests. 
For several years, a score of 400 has been enough to pass. But the new recommendations push proficiency minimums higher: in grade 4 reading, the committee proposed 444, up from 400, and the superintendent 449; in Algebra I, the committee recommended 445 and the superintendent.
The new performance standards will not take effect until spring 2026.

Tiara Booker-Dwyer, the Virginia Department of Education’s deputy superintendent of Student Outcomes and School Quality, told the board that the department will meet directly with school leaders to discuss the impacts of the new cut scores and develop support plans. The board is expected to vote on a phased implementation model — lasting no fewer than four years — at its Oct. 24 meeting.
“We have impact data by divisions, and we’re going around the month of October to each division, to share that impact data with them, to talk through strategies on the support that’s needed,” Booker-Dwyer said. “That’s why we’re coming back to the board in October for approval of the phase-in model because we can make tweaks, we want to make sure we’re doing what’s right for the school divisions and honoring requests that they have made.”
Gullickson emphasized the importance of the vote, adding that it was “the most critical” action because it reaffirms Virginia’s commitment to its students and their future.
“I am excited that every parent in the commonwealth and teacher and principal and superintendent and, most importantly, students will have the confidence that as they walk across that stage, they know that it means that they are truly ready for the pathway that they are being called to pursue,” Gullickson said.
Ahead of the October vote, the board will also consider a policy plan to add a temporary ”approaching” category to recognize progress toward proficiency during the phase-in. The plan would also revise score reports for parents to include details such as “score earned, performance level, content mastery, growth areas, and strategies and resources to advance learning,” while expanding professional development and resources for teachers and families.
Rodney Jordan, a representative for the Virginia School Boards Association, said the group supports higher expectations but stressed they must come with adequate resources. 
“VSBA remains dedicated to support excellent student outcomes for each and every public school student,” Jordan said. “Critical to achieving that goal is communicating with clarity and transparency the current reality for students and the instruction resources and support necessary to ensure student success.”
Phillip Abou-Zaki, who identified as having experience in the plumbing pipeline industry, said raising proficiency expectations will better prepare students for the workforce, because graduates are currently not ready to step into specific fields, including plumbing, which supports hospitals and universities.
“We hire promising young people who are motivated and hardworking, but they struggle with the math needed to do the job that slows down their progress, creates frustration and ultimately limits their earning potential,” Abou-Zaki said. 
“When we raise expectations, we send a message to students, families and schools that we believe in our kids and know they are capable of more. High standards are about preparing young people for real-world success.”

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)Southwest Virginia has been making strides to bring new life to abandoned mine sites. Millions of dollars have been invested in the region to plug the old coal mines, restore the land, and repurpose the space for economic development. Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced last week that an additional $11 million will open up another round of applications.
“Virginia thrives when every region has the resources it needs to grow,” Youngkin said in a news release. “This funding honors Southwest Virginia’s mining legacy by investing in its economic future, with projects that build infrastructure, attract new jobs, and revitalize its communities.”
Since the program began in 2017, funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have supported efforts to convert former mine lands into industrial parks, energy projects and other infrastructure uses. In 2023, the program was awarded a record $23 million to be used over the next 15 years. There have been 50 projects since its inception.
“It’s that things like mine openings are closed off, high-walls taken down, new roads are built near the areas that were affected by mining operations, or new economic centers are built on or near what was previously mining lands,” said Richard Borean, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Energy.
The program addresses Abandoned Mine Lands — portions of land disturbed by past mining \ that were never restored to their original state. That practice was banned under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
“There are thousands of acres of land impacted by mining in Virginia, with approximately 7,000 abandoned mine land features. Approximately 100,000 acres have been impacted in Southwest Virginia,” Borean said.
Virginia was one of six states in this round of funding to receive grants from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). Counties with coal mine histories must demonstrate their development plans to qualify for the money.
Virginia has a long history of coal mining, with the first commercial coal field opening in Richmond in 1758. Today, only one coal field remains operational in the southwest region, with 45 active mines.
“AMLER is part of a broader strategy that combines workforce development, infrastructure investment, and entrepreneurship to drive prosperity. These funds give communities the flexibility to pursue the projects that matter most to their future,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura in a news release.
Examples of past projects that utilized this funding include the Trammel Community Revitalization in Dickenson County, site preparation for the Wise County IDA solar project, and parking and trails improvements near Devil’s Bathtub in Scott County. Applications for the latest round of funding are due Dec. 18.

An analysis of 10 years of election results — president, governor, senate and every other partisan statewide race. On average, Republicans win 55%-45% over Democrats.
With that breakdown, Democrats proposed a redrawn map with eight seats leaning red, seven blue.
But right now, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts are made up of 10 Republicans and five Democrats.
Catherine Turcer with Common Cause Ohio, a nonprofit that advocates for fair maps, said that’s a problem.
“It’s very hard to have accountable government if the district lines favor political parties so hard to the right or so hard to the left,” Turcer said.


She is concerned because Republicans haven’t introduced a map yet, and the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting’s deadline to pass a bipartisan map is Sept. 30.



“This is one of those situations where a picture is worth 1,000 words and that they have not actually begun this process in good faith is incredibly sad,” she said.
GOP party leaders said they want at least 12 of the 15 districts to lean Republican.
“Four Democrat counties in Ohio, three split counties and 79 Republican counties,” state Rep. Nick Santucci (R-Niles) said during the committee’s meeting Monday, noting a 2025 county commission map. “What do we say to the other counties that are solidly red? Do we just say, ‘Well, sorry, too bad?'”
Santucci and GOP leader Tony Schroeder argued that Democrats make up nearly half of the voting base, but they are primarily located in only a few urban areas: Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton, and Athens, based on a WEWS/OCJ analysis. These areas have different priorities and demographics from red districts, Schroeder said.
“This would create situations where people in rural Ohio, especially, would be governed by people directly in urban centers,” he said.



There’s a solution for Democrats, he added.
“They can move,” according to Schroeder.
Democrats swiftly rejected this proposal.
“So you want people to move out of Franklin County, in the city of Columbus, to rural counties just to make things fair for a map?” state Sen. Bill DeMora said on Monday. “I mean, that’s utter ridiculousness.”
Turcer threw the argument back to the GOP, saying that just because the Republicans are more spread out, it doesn’t mean they get to supersede Democratic voices.
“Land doesn’t vote,” she said.
Urban and urban-suburban areas, where 45% of Ohio voters live, shouldn’t have to be governed by the rural areas, either, Democrats said.
Asked if a 12-3 or 13-2 map was reflective of the voter populace, Turcer said “well, of course not.”
The Republican leaders say that they won’t have a map by the constitutional deadline, which means the GOP-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission will take over the process in October.
Deadlines and process
Sept. 30: The lawmakers need to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber, and at least 50% support of Democrats.
If that fails, it goes to the ORC.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: A map can also pass with a simple majority in the General Assembly, but it must be replaced after four years.
Republicans haven’t introduced their own map yet, but party leaders say they want at least 12 districts to lean red.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Hours after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Suzanne Swierc shared two thoughts on her private Facebook page — that the killing of the right-wing activist was wrong, and that his death reflected “the violence, fear and hatred he sowed.”
The post upended her life.
Indiana Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita soon obtained a screenshot of the post by Swierc, an administrator at Ball State University, and added it to an official website naming and shaming educators for their comments about Kirk.
Libs of Tik Tok, a social media account dedicated to mocking liberals, shared her comments with its 4.4 million followers on X. A week after the post, the university fired her.
“The day that my private post was made public without my consent was one of the worst days of my life,” Swierc told reporters this past week. She said she received calls, texts and other harassing messages, including one suggesting she should be killed, that left her terrified.
A wave of firings and investigations has swept through academia and government in the wake of Kirk’s death, as state agencies, colleges and local school districts take action against employees over comments perceived as offensive or inappropriate. Dozens of workers in higher education alone have lost their jobs.
A Texas State University student was expelled after he publicly reenacted Kirk’s assassination; Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans had called for the student’s expulsion. Clemson University in South Carolina fired one worker and removed two professors from teaching. The University of Mississippi fired an employee. An Idaho Department of Labor employee was terminated.
The purge is driven in part by Republican elected officials who are encouraging Americans to report co-workers, their children’s teachers and others who make comments seen as crossing the line. They have been egged on by the Trump administration, with Vice President JD Vance urging listeners of Kirk’s podcast to call the employer of anyone “celebrating” his killing.
President Donald Trump has threatened to expand the crackdown beyond Kirk, warning falsely in the Oval Office last week that negative press coverage of him is “really illegal,” despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press.

At Kirk’s memorial service, Trump said, “I hate my opponent.” His choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission threatened ABC over comments about the reaction to Kirk’s death made by the late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel and the network pulled his show for several days.
Mark Johnson, a First Amendment attorney based in Kansas City, Missouri, who has been practicing law for 45 years, said he had never seen a moment like the current one.
“Not even close,” Johnson said. “What’s been happening in the last month is astonishing.”
In Indiana, Rokita is using his office’s “Eyes on Education” webpage to publicize examples of educators who have made controversial remarks about Kirk. The page, billed as a transparency tool, housed a hodgepodge of submitted complaints about teachers and schools in the past. Now, it also includes 28 Kirk-related submissions as of Thursday afternoon.
Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden threatened to strip an entire town of federal funding after a high school math teacher noted on her personal Facebook page that Kirk had in the past said some gun deaths are worth it to have the Second Amendment. The teacher has been suspended.
Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who is leaving his job next month to head up a conservative teachers organization, has launched investigations of school employees in response to tips submitted to Awareity, an online platform that allows parents and others to report concerns. Last week the Oklahoma State Department of Education said it had received 224 reports of “defamatory comments.”
Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Fine has urged people with information about anyone celebrating Kirk’s death who works in government in Florida to contact his office. And South Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace wants federal funding cut off for any school that fails to fire or discipline staff who “glorify or justify” political violence.
“It’s at a scale never before seen and I think it’s completely unhinged,” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, said of the rush to fire higher education faculty.
Free speech consequences?
Kirk, who founded the campus conservative activism organization Turning Point USA and was close to Trump, was a hero to many Republicans. They saw a charismatic family man and a Christian unafraid to take his hard-right vision onto liberal college campuses.
But many Democrats and liberals experienced Kirk as a provocateur with a record of incendiary remarks about people of color, immigrants and Islam. While many of Kirk’s opponents have condemned the assassination, some have also emphasized their disagreement with his views or suggested his death arose out of what they saw as his hateful rhetoric.
“I have faculty who are getting fired, who have tenure and are getting fired, for saying things like ‘I condemn political violence but the words that Charlie Kirk used, he sort of reaped what he sowed,’” Wolfson said. “All things told, I may not agree with that statement, but that’s a perfectly reasonable thing for somebody to say. Certainly not something to be fired for.”

Some Republicans have long denounced what they view as past Democratic censorship, including Biden administration efforts to pressure social media companies to censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have also criticized firings and pushed back on perceived political correctness run amok during the height of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, moments of ascendant progressive influence.
But as the current round of terminations plays out, some conservatives argue public employees who speak out about Kirk are facing the consequences of their actions. Oklahoma state Rep. Gabe Woolley, a Republican, said individuals in a taxpayer-funded role who work with children should be held to a high level of accountability.
“I think the most important factor to consider … is that these people chose to enter the public square on public social media accounts and to mock and celebrate the death of an American patriot who was a Christian martyr who was killed for his faith doing what God called him to do,” Woolley said.
Woolley added that “if you choose to make something public, you should not be shocked or surprised by any type of public pushback.”
Swierc described a relatively restricted Facebook account. It was private and couldn’t be found by searching for her name; only individuals with mutual Facebook friends could request to add her as a friend. She did not list her employer on her profile.
Swierc’s post on Kirk could only be seen by her Facebook friends. At some point, someone — Swierc doesn’t know who — made a screenshot of the post. It was then circulated publicly and ended up on Indiana’s “Eyes on Education” page.
On Sept. 17, Ball State University President Geoffrey Mearns fired Swierc, who had been director of health promotion and advocacy within the Division of Student Affairs. In a letter informing Swierc of her termination, Mearns wrote that many current students had written to the university to express concern and that her post had caused unprecedented disruption.
Swierc filed a federal lawsuit against Mearns on Monday, alleging he violated her First Amendment rights. Swierc, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, wants a court to order Mearns to expunge her termination from her Ball State University personnel file, along with unspecified damages.
“I do not regret the post I made, and I would not take back what I said,” Swierc said during a virtual news conference organized by the ACLU of Indiana. “I believe that I, along with every person in this country, have First Amendment rights to be able to speak on a number of things.”
Ball State University declined to answer Stateline’s questions, citing the lawsuit. In an unsigned public statement on the day of Swierc’s firing, the university said the post was “inconsistent with the distinctive nature and trust” of Swierc’s leadership position and had caused significant disruption to the university.
Swierc’s lawsuit is one of a growing number of legal challenges to firings and employee discipline over comments about Kirk. On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the University of South Dakota to reinstate an art professor who had placed on administrative leave after calling Kirk a “Nazi” but later deleted the post and apologized.
Aggressive state attorney general
Swierc didn’t name Rokita, the attorney general, as a defendant in her lawsuit, but the official has loomed over the situation.
Two days after Kirk’s assassination, Rokita urged his followers on X to submit to him any evidence of educators or school administrators celebrating or rationalizing the killing. He wrote that they must be held accountable and “have no place teaching our students.”
But Rokita has also said the Indiana Attorney General’s Office isn’t investigating individuals submitted to his “Eyes on Education” page — suggesting the effort is mainly intended to generate public pressure against employers. Each example on the page lists contact information for the school’s leadership and in some instances information about the next local school board meeting.
“For a government official, especially of that caliber, to be creating a database and doing this has an incredibly chilling effect on speech,” said Ashkhen Kazaryan, a senior legal fellow at The Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank located at Vanderbilt University that promotes the values of free speech and free expression.
Rokita didn’t agree to an interview. “Our goal is to provide transparency, equipping parents with the information they need to make informed decisions about their children’s education,” Rokita said in a news release.
On Monday, Rokita sent a six-page letter to school superintendents and public university administrators, providing guidance on the legal authority to fire and discipline teachers for speech related to Kirk. The letter suggested that speech occurring on social media is a factor that weighs in favor of the authority to fire an employee because it carries the risk of being amplified and disrupting school operations.
Rokita also analyzed comments about Kirk by a U.S. history teacher in Indiana who had said the assassinated activist can “suck it” and referred to comments made by Kirk in 2023 that some gun deaths every year are the cost of Second Amendment rights. The district’s employer had chosen not to terminate the teacher, but Rokita laid out a legal justification for firing the employee.
He concluded the letter by writing that many schools would be within their legal authority to fire teachers “who have similarly contributed to the divisive and, for many, painful eruption of controversial discourse on social media and elsewhere concerning Charlie Kirk.”
Joseph Mastrosimone, an employment law professor at Washburn University, said private employers have broad discretion to fire workers over speech. But the government is different, he said, with the First Amendment providing at least some level of protection to employees.
Decades of court cases have established the core principle that if a public employee is speaking in their capacity as a citizen on a matter of public concern, then the government can only take action if the speech causes significant disruption to the delivery of the public service and that disruption outweighs the employee’s interest in the speech, he said.
Mastrosimone said if a teacher’s message made in his or her own time is causing community outrage and pandemonium, “that’s probably going to count as some disruption.”
“And there might be sufficient disruption to outweigh whatever interest the employee has in the speech,” Mastrosimone said. But the closer the teacher’s message is to core political speech — such as voicing support for a candidate for office — the more the scales tip in favor of the employee being able to speak without fear of discipline.
“It is certainly a matter of public concern, what’s going on here with the Charlie Kirk assassination. The interests are probably pretty high, I would think,” Mastrosimone said.
Push to honor Kirk
As some Republican officials have called for action against public employees who have made comments about Kirk, they have often drawn a line at what they see as celebrating or glorifying his assassination. Walters, the outgoing Oklahoma state superintendent, has gone further and is investigating districts for “refusing to honor his memory.”
In times of crisis, states have few tools to fight misinformation

The Oklahoma State Department of Education last week said in addition to reports on individual teachers, it was investigating 30 reports of schools that didn’t observe a moment of silence. Three reports alleged schools weren’t flying their flags at half-staff.
On Tuesday, Walters announced an official push to start a Turning Point USA chapter in every Oklahoma high school. Later that day, he announced he would resign as superintendent to become CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a new group that casts itself as a conservative alternative to teachers’ unions.
Walters’ Turning Point effort comes after Oklahoma state Sen. Shane Jett, a Republican, filed three pieces of legislation to honor Kirk, including one that would establish “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Day” and another requiring public colleges and universities to develop a “Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza” on their campuses.
Walters and Jett didn’t respond to interview requests.
“Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active,” Walters said in a news release on Tuesday. “We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)With no warning last Friday, a former Cincinnati Children’ s Hospital chaplain was released after a 72-day stay in the Butler County Jail. 
It appears that immigration officials concluded that they didn’t have a case for revoking Ayman Solimon’s status as a refugee. That’s what his lawyers and his many defenders had been saying all along.
“How they came to this conclusion, no one knows,” Soliman said in a phone interview Monday evening. “There was no case. It was an act of retaliation. It was an ungrounded, baseless case.” 
Even so, the attempt to deport the Egyptian asylee ignited a national uproar. It also sparked a protest march to which police reacted and arrested two journalists who tried to cover the march. 
Soliman fled Egypt in 2014 after being detained by the government four times and tortured on one of those occasions, he said.
As a tour guide under the regime of autocrat Hosni Mubarek, Soliman said he was arrested for his dissident political views.
Authorities applied electroshocks, beat him and put out cigarettes on his naked body, according to Soliman. They took him to an open courtyard in winter, stripped him to his underwear and doused him in cold water. They deprived him of food, water and sleep. They hung him by his arms, which were behind his back.
“This was all extrajudicial punishment,” Soliman said. 
Mubarek was deposed during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Soliman worked as a journalist during that time, as a freelance producer for international news organizations, and on a documentary.
Representing the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi was elected president in 2012. But the military seized power the following year. Soliman again found himself in the crosshairs of the authorities.
“After the military coup, I was abducted off the street as I was going to cover some protests opposing the coup against the elected president,” he said. “For three days they told me I was a criminal and I was a traitor working for a foreign agency. I was a journalist. I had my credentials. It was not a crime. But of course they accused every independent journalist of being a traitor working for a foreign power that was working to destabilize the great country of Egypt.”
Never having been the object of an official proceeding by the government, Soliman was able to go to Chicago in 2014 to study documentary filmmaking. He initially planned on returning to Egypt, thinking the military government would be short-lived. 
But after a government raid on his Egyptian home and seeing multiple journalists abducted and disappeared, Soliman decided to apply for asylum. It was granted in 2018.
That asylum was suddenly revoked on June 3 over alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the United States has not designated a terrorist group, though Trump and Republicans in Congress are pushing to do so.
“They claimed that I volunteered with a charitable organization in Egypt — it was one of the most trusted and reputable organizations in Egypt — and they said it might be linked to the Muslim Brotherhood,” Soliman said. “Even if it was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood — which is not true — it’s not listed as a terrorist organization in the U.S.” 
After the cancellation of a July 3 hearing in immigration court, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Soliman on July 9 and took him to Butler County Jail in Hamilton. The jail, along with a number of others in Ohio, has a contract to house people detained by ICE under President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation effort.
Soliman said he was treated poorly. But then, so was everyone.
“It’s a jail,” he said. “ICE detainees shouldn’t be there. We are not criminals. They applied the same rules to us as they applied to the other offenders. It’s just dehumanizing.”
But much more than that, he was scared what would happen if attempts to revoke his refugee status were successful and he was sent back to Egypt. 
“In some ways, it was as scary as what happened in Egypt because if I was deported, it could be torture and death,” he said. “So for me, it wasn’t just about being in jail, it was about the consequences. For me deportation could be death.”
As Soliman sat in jail, his legal team and others poked holes in the case to revoke his asylum. Two academics said their work was misrepresented  by federal authorities who tried to use it to support their claim that Soliman was connected to terrorists. His lawyers pointed to what they said were false, shifting reasons the government used to hold their client in jail.
Finally, the government appeared to capitulate on Friday when it released Soliman.
“The trial was coming up next week and I think it was going to be pretty ugly for the government,” said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. “It was pretty gory what happened to him in Egypt. He was tortured. All those details were going to be repeated. The government didn’t really have a case. They didn’t have any specific accusations of bad activity that Ayman was involved in.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the specifics of Soliman’s case. But it said it had power over noncitizens even if they’re in the country legally.
“An alien – even with a pending application or lawful status – is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” an unnamed DHS official said in an email. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “is responsible for administering America’s lawful immigration system, ensuring the integrity of the immigration process, and protecting the interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens; but generally speaking, and as a matter of practice, USCIS cannot discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
Soliman is free, but he said he’s concerned about what happened to some supporters during his incarceration.
Two chaplains were fired from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital — one for attending a vigil for Soliman, and another for giving media interviews in support of her former colleague. After he fired the two, hospital CEO Steve Davis warned other employees to keep quiet about Soliman.
Soliman called on the hospital to rehire the chaplains.
“I think my friends did the right thing by advocating for their colleague, who was facing death back in Egypt,” he said. “I know those who made this decision (to fire them) got a lot of pushback. And I think (the chaplains) should be back in their jobs.”
On July 17, as about 100 people left a vigil for Soliman and marched over the John A. Roebling Bridge into Kentucky, the Covington, Ky., Police Department made 15 arrests, including journalists, shortly after giving an order to disperse. 
Cincinnati CityBeat reporter Madeline Fening and photo intern Lucas Griffith were arrested as they covered the march, which occupied travel lanes, obstructing traffic. 
Fening and Griffith were charged with felony rioting. 
Covington authorities later dropped the felony charges against the journalists, and Fening is scheduled for trial on misdemeanors next week. Griffith is scheduled for Oct. 2. 
Meanwhile, more than 20 journalism organizations last week wrote to Kenton County Attorney Stacy Tapke, stressing the importance of a free press and asking her to drop the charges against the reporters, WCPO TV reported Tuesday.
Soliman said he watched TV coverage of the march and the way Covington police reacted from jail. He said he couldn’t sleep that night — partly because of the violence in which some officers engaged. But Soliman was also disturbed that police in the United States would be so quick to arrest reporters covering their beats.
“A free press is essential in any civilized country,” he said. “A free press is a guarantee that people’s voices will always be heard. It is not a crime, and journalists should be protected as long as they’re doing their work professionally. Brutalizing and arresting journalists means these people are doing something wrong, and they don’t want the journalists to cover it.”
Soliman added, “I’m not surprised this is happening with this current government. Civil rights. Free speech. The First Amendment. They are all under direct threat from this government.”

Bob Lynn (right) addresses a subcommittee of the House Education Funding Committee about a bill to expand due process rights for students and faculty on college campuses, on Sept. 23, 2025 (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)When a University of New Hampshire student reports to the school that they have been sexually assaulted by another student, a lengthy process begins.
Depending on how the alleged perpetrator responds to the accusation, that process can either be handled voluntarily, via a mediation process, or it can play out in a hearing with both sides attempting to prove their case. The possibilities are spelled out in the university’s 31-page policy prohibiting sexual misconduct. 
The process can be complex. The victim and the alleged offender are each allowed to be represented by an attorney. The hearings can feel like court trials, with opening and closing statements made by lawyers or representatives before a decision maker. 
But however the process plays out, the UNH policy makes one point clear: “Neither party may directly question the other party or witness.” This fall, some House lawmakers are proposing to change that.
A bill gaining momentum would overhaul how UNH and other public colleges and universities conduct disciplinary proceedings. And one proposed change would require the institutions to allow alleged perpetrators to question their accusers directly. 
In New Hampshire, the bill could kick off the latest round of a long-running national debate.
Sponsored by Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican and a former state Supreme Court chief justice, House Bill 510 would mandate that those institutions put in place a standardized list of due process guarantees in those disciplinary proceedings. Among the rights universities would need to extend to the accused are “the right of the presumption that no violation occurred,” “the right against self-incrimination,” and “the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who provide evidence against” the defendant.
The bill would apply to university disciplinary proceedings against students, student organizations, and faculty members. The proposed statutory requirements could thus apply to a number of proceedings, from academic dishonesty to breaches of the code of conduct. 
But the bill’s implications for sexual misconduct proceedings has drawn specific criticism from Democrats in Concord, who have argued the new process could re-traumatize victims and discourage them from reporting sexual assaults. 
Republicans, like Lynn, have countered that the right to confront one’s accuser is essential to a fair hearing, and have pointed to the consequences such proceedings can have for those accused. 
On Tuesday, in an exchange during a House Education Funding Committee work session on the bill, Democratic Rep. Hope Damon, of Croydon, raised concerns about how the bill could affect survivors of sexual assault.
“I think it is risking grave harm to victims of sexual assault to be cross examined by their assaulter,” she said.
“I fundamentally disagree with that,” Lynn responded. “The idea that somebody can be charged with … something that could affect the person for the rest of their lives that they do not have the right to confront their accuser.”
The University System of New Hampshire and the Community College System of New Hampshire have both raised objections to the bill, arguing it will require costly and unnecessary changes to their policies.
“We feel that due process is already well represented within all of our policies,” said Shannon Reid, executive director of government affairs at CCSNH, speaking to lawmakers. 
The bill, she said, “includes specificity such that it would necessitate a significant level of work to basically redraw how we do things without … substantively strengthening due process.”
A federal back-and-forth on campus due process
The New Hampshire bill comes after a series of dramatic swings in federal policy around campus sexual assault proceedings in recent years.
Colleges and universities are required to follow Title IX, a federal law established in 1972 that outlaws sex-based discrimination on campus. 
In a pair of guidelines in 2011 and 2014, the Department of Education under President Barack Obama interpreted Title IX to require higher education institutions to address sexual assault on campus. Among its recommendations, the department said it “strongly discourages schools from allowing the parties personally to question or cross-examine each other during the hearing.”
But in President Donald Trump’s first term, the Department of Education reversed course, repealing many of the Obama-era sexual assault recommendations and advising colleges to allow alleged offenders to cross-examine alleged victims using an advisor.
Unlike the proposed New Hampshire law, the Trump administration policy, which took effect in 2020, did not require institutions to allow defendants to question their accusers directly. The policy remains in place today; an effort by President Joe Biden to change the guidelines again was struck down by a federal judge in Kentucky in January.
To public institutions, the changing guidance has felt like a “pendulum,” said Chad Pimentel, general counsel of the University System of New Hampshire. The latest version of the UNH anti-sexual assault guidance, for instance, was crafted with the Trump administration’s 2020 guidance in mind.
So far, there does not appear to be interest in the second Trump administration to make any more changes, Pimentel said in an interview. But HB 510 would require that the university drop its prohibition on parties directly questioning each other.
Pimentel argued there already exists due process protections that allow someone accused to challenge their accuser’s narrative. Typically, at hearings, this is done by submitting a list of questions that they would like the neutral fact-finder to ask the other person.
“There’s ways to confront (the other party) without you having to sit across — this far away — from somebody you’re accusing and that person gets to ask you questions,” he said. 
Lynn has argued that to be most robust, the right to confront an accuser must be given to the accused, not just to their lawyer or representative or to a fact-finder. 
But, he added, “that doesn’t mean that anything goes, that the person that’s accused can berate, harass, yell at (the accuser), whatever. Of course, they can’t do that.”
Growing Republican support
While Democrats have objected, Lynn’s bill appears to have Republican support. 
HB 510 was introduced in January but was held by the committee over the summer for further work. The full committee is slated to vote on a recommendation for the bill next week and the House will take up that recommendation in early January. 
On Tuesday, Republican Chairman Rick Ladd of Haverhill suggested he could support the bill with some revisions. Ladd’s main concern was that the definitions in the bill for “student,” “student organization,” and “public institution of higher education” are different from those in other parts of the higher education statutes. Lynn said he would be open to amending the bill to align those definitions.
If the bill passes the House in January, it will also need to pass the Senate. In 2024, a similar bill brought by Lynn, House Bill 1288, failed to clear that hurdle. 
Back then, senators in both parties expressed worries that HB 1288 could force the institutions to violate collective bargaining agreements with university staff unions, which typically lay out agreed-upon disciplinary procedures. The Senate voted unanimously to send the bill to further study.
This year’s bill is meant to address that problem, Lynn said Tuesday. HB 510 stipulates that the new disciplinary process will not affect faculty member disciplinary procedures until their current collective bargaining agreement runs out. After that, new collective bargaining agreements would need to align with the new law, Lynn said.
To Lynn and other Republicans, the aims of the bill are clear: to bring university procedures in line with those already employed by courts. And if universities already have the bill’s protections in their policies, they won’t need to change anything, he said.
“I think, as a state, we should give everybody equal protection and make sure that certain standards are applicable to every campus, and this, to me, sets the minimum amount of protection that everybody should have when they attend the higher education institution,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. 
Opponents say that determination should be made by the institution. 
“There’s no indication that the rights of students aren’t being met, or parents, within the law,” said Rep. Wayne Burton, a Durham Democrat. “I don’t think the state needs to chime in from this level.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bob-Lynn-House-Education-Funding-Committee-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 05:56:21.398780

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia has received approval from the Trump administration to extend its Pathways to Coverage program, a partial Medicaid expansion with work requirement components, at least through the end of 2026.
An approval letter from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that was sent this week to Georgia leaders noted that the temporary extension and its amendments are designed to help the program accomplish its goals. 
The federal agency approved changes that were announced early this year, such as exempting caregivers of young children from the program’s work requirement. 
Currently, participants must complete 80 hours of work, job training, education or community service every month – and report that activity to the state. Under the new program rules, those qualifying activities would need to be reported annually instead of monthly as previously required. 
CMS noted that these changes are meant to “increase the number of potentially eligible beneficiaries under the demonstration who qualify for and maintain coverage.”

Gov. Brian Kemp touted the approval as a collaboration with the Trump administration while criticizing former President Joe Biden administration’s efforts to prevent states from establishing work requirements in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
“Unlike the previous administration which chose to sue, obstruct, and delay, President Trump and his team have worked alongside us to improve Georgia Pathways and ultimately deliver a better program to Georgians who need it most. We look forward to continuing that partnership in the months ahead,” Kemp said in a statement Thursday.

The program was extended shortly after the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report highlighting concerns about the program’s effectiveness and cost. The report was ordered by Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff, along with other lawmakers. The report found that the program came in “over budget and under delivered,” enrolling only 3,500 individuals in its first year, far short of the state’s projected goal of 25,028.
The GAO report found that the administrative spending for the program was substantial. Out of the $80.3 million spent on the program from fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of 2025, approximately $54.2 million was allocated to administrative costs, with $26.1 million spent on health care benefits for recipients.
CMS’s approval letter acknowledged the low enrollment, noting that as of May 2025, enrollment was approximately 7,463 individuals, and attributes the shortfall to a “general lack of awareness and understanding of the program; a complex and administratively burdensome application process; and a limited set of exemptions and qualifying activities.”
The new GAO report also noted that CMS “wrongly approved higher federal matching rates for certain administrative costs, wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Reaction to the program’s extension was mixed
The extension and its policy changes have been met with a mix of praise and criticism.
Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a nonprofit think tank and policy advocacy group, said the changes are positive steps but called for a more comprehensive approach.
“More covered lives are always good but we know Georgia can do better,” said Crawford, a former Republican commissioner in Habersham County. Crawford criticized the program as “fiscally irresponsible.” 
In an interview Thursday, Crawford pointed to challenges Georgia will face in 2026 with the state managing two distinct work requirement policies: a less-frequent reporting schedule for the Pathways to Coverage population, while establishing the more frequent reporting requirements under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that will be implemented in 2027. That could increase administrative costs for the state, and it’s unclear whether the Pathways to Coverage population will be exempt from less frequent reporting requirements once work requirements under the new federal law are implemented.
“I think there’s still a lot of unknowns,” Crawford said.
The Georgia Hospital Association praised the extension, saying that it “will further strengthen the program and improve coverage and access to health care for Georgians.”
“This continuation further preserves access for the thousands of Georgians that are already benefiting and improves access for additional Georgians that will now find it more streamlined to qualify. We appreciate the Governor, the team at DCH, and CMS for continuing to champion and advance this program,” said Caylee Noggle, president and CEO of the Georgia Hospital Association.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that changing to annual reporting is an improvement for the program, but work requirements are still likely to be an impediment to coverage. She said that while the monthly reporting was burdensome for recipients, it did not account for Georgia’s low program enrollment because the state did not disenroll individuals who did not submit monthly reports to verify their qualifying hours and activities.
“Moving to annual reporting is a critical program pivot and will reduce the administrative burden on enrollees. However, it does not change the fundamental issues that are suppressing enrollment among potentially eligible Georgians and creating unnecessary costs for Georgia’s taxpayers: an outdated, confusing enrollment system; disinvestment in customer service and frontline caseworkers; and unnecessary bureaucratic red tape for low-income, uninsured Georgians that largely are already working, going to school, or caregiving,” Chan said in a statement.

During a recent Health Connect South conference in Atlanta, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz addressed the Georgia program and defended the concept of work requirements in health coverage. He spoke about the national approach to Medicaid and the changes brought by recent federal legislation.
“I know a lot about the Georgia program. It’s actually known widely around the country, because it’s, I think, a very smart path for states who are not expanding Medicaid, and it might be a path for states that have expanded who want to go back. And it’s a clever and thoughtful and customized approach,” Oz said.
He went on to describe the philosophy behind the requirements, saying that without work requirements, Americans covered by Medicaid may be incentivized not to seek employment.
“The people don’t want to just stay at home. They actually do want to go work, but because of this bizarre compensation and almost bribe for you to stay home by giving you free health insurance, you incentivize people not to enter the workforce,” Oz said.
Crawford pushed back on that notion, saying that she has not seen any “compelling evidence” suggesting that people who would benefit from Medicaid expansion are incentivized to stay home when that coverage does not include a work reporting requirement.
“I think, honestly, when, for that specific population, more red tape is introduced, it can incentivize quite the opposite. These are folks who want to work. They want to work. They’re going to work. They’re trying to pay their bills and do what we so often say, ‘pull themselves up by their bootstraps,’” Crawford said.
Warnock, however, cast Georgia’s program as an example of bad policy.
“The only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,” Warnock said in a statement Thursday. “If Republican politicians were serious about getting people to work, they would have closed the coverage gap nationwide and cut out the government bureaucracy. (Renewing the program) will continue to keep health care away from Georgians who need it most. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it only makes our country sicker and poorer.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC0231-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 05:56:21.398780

Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.


The plant emits roughly 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year, complicating Cleveland’s effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report released by advocacy group Industrious Labs this summer. The plant is the city’s largest single source of planet-warming pollution.


Cleveland’s climate action plan is ​“bold and achievable,” said Hilary Lewis, steel director for Industrious Labs. But ​“if they want to achieve those goals, they have to take action on this Cleveland Works facility.”


As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.

Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 Goal Achiever in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 infrastructure law.


Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of ​“green” hydrogen made with renewable energy. In June, Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves backed away from a federally funded project to convert its Middletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.


To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.

Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 39 early deaths per year, more than 1,700 lost work days, and more than 9,000 asthma cases. Cleveland ranks as the country’s fifth-worst city for people with asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.


 A road map for cutting carbon



Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6 is a hulking vessel that removes impurities from iron ore by combining it with limestone and coke, a form of coal that burns at very high temperatures. Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.


To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% if natural gas is used. Using green hydrogen would slash emissions even more, the Industrious Labs team found.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #5 in 2022.
Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.

Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6.


To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6 to the direct reduction process, Industrious Labs said.


The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #6, would increase emissions cuts to 47%, according to the Industrious Labs report.


Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #5. Completing that work would cut Cleveland Works’ greenhouse gas emissions by 96%, according to the report.

 What happens now?

The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is in the process of finalizing the latest version of its climate action plan.


“My question about the paper is how feasible it truly is that Cleveland-Cliffs will deploy it in the near future,” McGowan said. Policy uncertainties at the federal level further complicate matters, she added.


For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.


But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector ​“will require more fundamental changes … [which] will take place over decades, rather than over a few years,” Cleveland’s climate action plan says. It also notes that low-carbon steel costs 40% more to produce compared to standard methods, ​“making it difficult for steelmakers to justify the investment in clean production.”


Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50 megawatts, the plan notes. That replaces electricity the plant would otherwise need from the grid, a majority of which still comes from fossil fuels.


Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.


In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. ​“I think the biggest thing is staying competitive,” Lewis said.
One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6 billion in a new plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, that will produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.


The Industrious Labs report ​“opens the door for Cleveland to be a leader in clean steel,” Lewis said. Before that can happen, though, ​“there’s a lot of work to do.”

Susan Collins, to push for a stopgap measure that includes an extension of health insurance subsidies.  In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that she supports exte[...]","Interfaith leaders held a vigil outside U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ Portland office on Sept. 25, 2025 urging her to push for health care subsidies in a must-pass government funding bill. (Photo courtesy of Maine People's Alliance)As the end of the fiscal year approaches, pressure is building on Maine’s congressional delegation, specifically Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, to push for a stopgap measure that includes an extension of health insurance subsidies. 
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that she supports extending the credit but believes they should be addressed outside the must-pass spending bill. She noted that, unlike funding the government, the subsidies don’t have a Sept. 30 deadline. They expire at the end of the calendar year. 
Democrats are trying to use the leverage of a looming government shutdown to push for an extension of these subsidies and other priorities they otherwise would likely not be able to enact under GOP control. It’s become a familiar approach for Congress, though the party roles have been reversed.  
Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

“It is clear that we need to act on this issue, but our focus right now needs to be on avoiding a harmful government shutdown that would cause disruptions to vital programs that many Americans rely on every day,” Collins said in a statement. “Our constituents should not be used as pawns amid a needlessly partisan impasse.”
The White House sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs.
Collins added that passing a continuing resolution would afford Congress the time to complete its annual funding bills and take up legislation to extend the subsidies this fall. 
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to discuss the minority party’s asks, which in addition to extending the subsidies include reversing the Medicaid cuts made in the GOP spending bill in July. 
With the president unwilling to negotiate with Democrats on funding now, some worry that leaves little assurance that the subsidies will be extended later, as Collins suggests. 
In September, the Maine Bureau of Insurance announced the finalized 2026 health insurance rates, with an average increase of 23.9% for the individual market and 17.5% for the small employer market.
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the subsidies are not extended. 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed the increased costs to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs.
Several groups held events in Maine on Thursday specifically calling on Collins to extend the subsidies and highlighting what’s at stake for Mainers. 
During a virtual event hosted by the Maine chapter of Protect Our Care, a progressive healthcare advocacy organization, Briana Bononcini, co-owner of the Portland Hunt + Alpine Club cocktail bar said she has been enrolled in a health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act since 2014. Not having insurance tied to an employer allowed her to start her small business while ensuring she and her children were still covered. 
“It’s been disappointing to see Susan Collins say that she supports restoring the premium tax credit, but the reality is that she could have stopped this from occurring and she chose not to,” Bononcini said. “I really think that if she truly cares, like she says she does, she will show up and make sure that the premium tax credits are in the bill.”
State Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) spoke at that event about broader implications of losing the credit, which he described as an existential threat to the entire health care system in the state.
Pointing to strides the state Legislature has made to expand health care coverage, such as creating a state-based insurance marketplace and reducing medical debt, Tipping said “these federal changes undo all of that work.” 
“Fewer Mainers will have health coverage, and when they’re sick, they’re going to go to the emergency room, which is the most expensive form of health care,” he said. “Mainers will pay for this in the form of increased premiums in their private insurance, and it’s going to hit Maine small business owners first and hardest.”
Additionally, faith leaders organized under Maine’s largest community organization, Maine People’s Alliance, held a vigil outside Collins’ Portland office on Thursday urging her to do what they see as the moral thing. 
“Accountability is a core part of my Unitarian Universalist faith,” said Rev. Tara Humphries of Allen Avenue Unitarian Universalist Church in Portland. “We are individuals, part of something much larger and more deeply connected than our own selves, and justice calls us to consider that when making decisions that impact the whole. So, I hold my elected officials accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of their most vulnerable constituents.”
Many of the speakers also called on Collins to stop funding to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in light of continued accusations of unlawful activity. 
“As people of faith, we believe the health and well-being of all our neighbors matter,” said Rev. Alison Patton of First Congregational Church of South Portland. “So we are calling on Senator Collins to step up and demand the budget changes we need, to ensure legal protections for immigrant Mainers, resist illegal ICE activity and preserve access to healthcare for all Mainers.”

(Getty Images)A wise man once said: “I do not believe in the cancel culture. I think redemption is necessary and even wise, and I would like others to forgive and restore with me anytime I make a mistake.”
The same wise man once told me: “I am a strong proponent of upholding our constitutional liberties, which includes freedom of the press. Our system can’t function honestly without it. When government tries to interfere with the right to speak, worship, assemble, or report what government is doing, the result is never good.”
Unfortunately, that man no longer sounds so wise.
He’s Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, who has decided to swerve hard to the right during his run for governor. He has squared off against former Gov. Jeff Colyer, who’s also aiming for the Republican nomination, in a battle to see who can most cravenly exploit this tortured political moment. Each man has called for firings of Kansans who posted horrible things online after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Kirk’s death was shocking and contemptible, the very opposite of free speech and expression. What’s more, online celebration by a handful of leftists damaged their cause and harmed our national conversation. (I don’t mean those who thoughtfully critiqued Kirk’s career and rhetoric.)
So it might make sense that Masterson would post the following to social media.

It might make sense. Yet back in 2021, Masterson’s fellow state Sen. Gene Suellentrop was arrested on DUI charges. According to officials, he was driving the wrong way on Interstate 70 in Topeka at speeds near 100 mph. He then challenged police after they pulled him over, calling an officer “donut boy.”
By any measure, Suellentrop posed a threat to public health and welfare. He wasn’t posting online. He put his fellow motorists at deadly risk. Yet in that case, Masterson issued the plea for tolerance I reproduced at the very beginning of this column. Those words carried weight, and Suellentrop served in the Kansas Senate through January 2023.
Does Masterson believe that others deserve such grace?
As for the First Amendment, that’s a matter of law. The U.S. Constitution protects a variety of expression that broad majorities of people find tasteless, vulgar and unforgivable.
That doesn’t protect those expressing such sentiments from social opprobrium or employment consequences, especially if they work for private businesses. Those on the left made such arguments fairly recently, as movement for social justice crested in 2020 and misinformation about COVID-19 flourished. Those on the right are making such arguments now, and while they might be hypocritical, they’re not wrong. The right to speak your mind doesn’t mean the right to say it without feedback.
Problems arise, however, when the government itself tries to enforce such consequences, or when those working for the government speak in their private capacity. That’s why Masterson’s second quote at the beginning of this column struck me.
Let’s read it again: “When government tries to interfere with the right to speak, worship, assemble, or report what government is doing, the result is never good.”
Masterson still serves as Senate president. He’s running to be the state’s chief executive. Is he not a representative of government? Is he not attempting to interfere with others’ right to speak? One of those targeted by his recent posts just filed a lawsuit against the Kansas State Department of Education, claiming interference in her rights as a private citizen.
As for Colyer, the former governor appears to reside on a completely different planet.
Give him points for consistency: Back in 2018, he complained about an art exhibit at the University of Kansas that included a defaced American flag. (Expression also protected by the First Amendment, in case you wondered.) His social media channels have competed with Masterson’s for hardcore conservative attention, but I had to highlight this particular post.

Quoth the former governor: “Kansas values free speech, but glorifying murder is not free speech. It is a moral collapse!”
I don’t disagree with the moral collapse part. We can all do better. But the First Amendment safeguards pretty heinous stuff, including the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest at military funerals. The agreeableness of expression has nothing to do with whether the Constitution protects it. As someone running for the highest office in Kansas, Colyer should know better.
I reached out to the Masterson and Colyer campaigns to give them a chance to respond. Neither one got back to me by publication time.
 
A few extra words
Hello, friends.
It’s been quite the month. On Sept. 14, I ran the classic William Allen White editorial “To an Anxious Friend,” which sums up my feelings during this turbocharged political moment.
But I feel like I owe you a bit of an explanation for why I’ve approached opinion columns the way I have since Kirk’s death. I have not raced to run pieces on the topic, by myself or others. In troubled times, I believe that those of us in the opinion business can choose to calm the waters or agitate them.
I chose to focus on calm.
Not because I’m not concerned. Not because I haven’t tracked the waves of antipathy from the right and left. But because when someone’s brutal slaying becomes part of our national partisan conflict, I feel profoundly queasy. It should go without saying that political violence and violent threats have no place in these United States. Full stop. It should also go without saying that the First Amendment remains the law of the land and applies to every one of us lucky enough to live here.
Unfortunately, some folks still miss that free speech part, which is why I wrote the main part of today’s column.
I do not plan to change my approach to opinion, focusing on how Statehouse policy affects everyday folks. The point of this section has always been to lift up Kansas voices on Kansas topics. You can find abundant commentary on topics of national interest everywhere. You can’t find an array of local commentators like ours anywhere else. I take this job seriously, and I treasure the role of curating community conversations.

The findings, published by researchers at Ohio State University and Johns Hopkins University, followed up participants from a study published in 2021 to track whether the dramatic improvements in depression symptoms would endure. The results suggest they do – and, remarkably, without serious side-effects.
The original study involved 24 people aged 21 to 75 who were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin treatment in 2019 and 2020 either immediately or after an eight-week delay. Each participant received two doses of the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms, spaced two weeks apart, alongside 13 hours of psychotherapy support.
When researchers checked in five years later, the improvements in depression seen after one year were still holding strong, suggesting psilocybin therapy may last longer than traditional treatments, such as antidepressants or psychotherapy.
But the researchers are cautious about overselling their findings. The follow-up study lacked a comparison group, making it impossible to know whether people who recovered from depression through other means might experience similar long-term success. Eleven of the 18 participants who remained in the trial also reported using antidepressants during the study period, muddying the waters about what exactly drove their continued recovery.
The study design presents other puzzles as well. Was it the psilocybin itself that proved beneficial, or the extensive psychotherapy, or some combination of both? The original research didn’t include a placebo group – everyone knew they were taking psilocybin – raising questions about whether expectations alone might have influenced the outcomes.
Despite these limitations, other studies are painting a similar picture of psilocybin’s enduring effects on depression. While psychedelic research is still in its infancy and grapples with design challenges, the results consistently show significant reductions in depression symptoms following psychedelic-assisted therapy.
What makes these findings particularly intriguing is the suggestion that just one or two treatment sessions might deliver lasting benefits. This is in stark contrast to traditional antidepressants, which typically require daily use and often come with a catalogue of side-effects.
The researchers propose that psilocybin therapy may trigger “positive behavioural feedback loops”, helping people gain fresh perspectives and emotional insights that continue benefiting their lives long after the treatment ends. This could enable the development of healthier habits and relationships that serve as natural buffers against depression’s return.
One participant captured this transformation vividly: “I’m doing more of activities that I enjoy. My life these days is a lot more social with family. Helping out my family. Helping out friends. Connecting with old friends.”
 Psychology matters

At Lund University in Sweden, my colleagues and I are exploring similar territory, including an upcoming study on psilocybin and anorexia. And our early results, published in Scientific Reports, suggest that individual psychology plays a crucial role in both how people experience psychedelic sessions and the benefits they derive from them.
The picture becomes even more complex when considering that many people report personality changes after psychedelic experiences, particularly becoming more open to new experiences. This psychological shift adds another layer to understanding how and why psychedelics might produce lasting change.
Psychedelic research still faces significant hurdles, from creating convincing placebo groups to accounting for the self-selecting nature of many participants. These methodological challenges make it difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about psychedelics’ therapeutic potential.
Yet perhaps the most compelling evidence lies not in clinical scores but in participants’ own words about their transformed lives. As one person put it: “I think I’m more open to gratitude and more open to delight.” Such testimonies remind researchers why they’re exploring what some describe as potentially “one of the most meaningful experiences in life” – and why this emerging field of medicine deserves serious scientific attention.

(Getty Images)There has been a lot of talk lately about how best to connect some rural parts of our country to broadband. Broadband internet service is as vital to Nebraska’s well-being as any other critical infrastructure.
People considering a move want to know if their potential new home has reliable broadband, and people living without reliable service risk falling further behind as work, education and civic engagement increasingly move online.
Many like to focus on the upfront costs associated with connecting those areas of our state that have been left behind, and that is one crucial piece of information to determine how to get these areas connected. But there’s more to the story than just initial network construction costs.
It takes years of planning to design, build and pay for a network. It takes a business case often lacking in rural areas where distances are great and densities are low. And it’s not “mission accomplished” once a network is built.
Instead, building a network is one important step in the ongoing effort to deliver reliable and affordable connectivity. In other words, the mission of achieving “universal service” — ensuring that every American has both access to and can make use of broadband — takes work every day to achieve and sustain.
This is why we have the federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, an important and often overlooked program for rural internet access that you’ve likely never heard of. So, what is the USF? The Communications Act of 1934 included language that said that all Americans should have access to “rapid, efficient, nationwide communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.”
Almost 100 years later, the USF is the main federal program helping millions of rural consumers connect to services comparable to those in urban areas. It supports critical connections for schools, libraries and healthcare facilities in rural communities.
But even as the USF programs continue to be highly effective and enjoy widespread support, updates are needed to help sustain universal service for the decades to come. For example, the USF is currently paid for by contributions from service providers based on certain telecommunications services and revenues.
As fewer customers buy legacy telecom services, the burden on these companies and their customers increases, and entities whose services result in the greatest use of rural networks get a free ride while selling their own products. Netflix, for example, used to pay postage to get its content to its customers. Now ISPs essentially cover much of those delivery costs for them. This is unsustainable and unfair.
We need Congress to update the ways the USF is funded so that all who use and benefit from affordable and ubiquitous voice and broadband services contribute equitably to its mission. At the same time, transparency and accountability are critical when distributing billions of USF dollars.
Careful review and vetting of those seeking support is essential, and Nebraska broadband officials should continue to play an important complementary role in ensuring providers that receive USF funding are capable and have the capacity to serve the consumers and communities they are charged to help.
Congressional reforms should consider the contributions from members of a USF working group and rural broadband supporters, including U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb. Rural Americans need those reforms to update and sustain USF funding and help us achieve broadband connections built to last.

The panel issued slightly lower revenue projections for the current year and forecasted weak revenue growth in its first look at fiscal 2027. (Photo from grandbrothers/Shutterstock.com. )A key fiscal panel revised its revenue estimates downward slightly for the current fiscal year, saying Thursday that it expects revenues to be less than one-tenth of a percent lower than the March forecast.
The three-member Board of Revenue Estimates said the revenue forecast would likely have been higher if not for federal tax changes made this summer in President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill.
Given the continued economic uncertainty related to that bill, and to a looming government shutdown and threatened layoffs of federal workers, panel members said the state has dodged a fiscal bullet so far.
The meeting Thursday also offered a first forecast of revenues for fiscal 2027. The initial estimate of about $27.1 billion — 1.7% higher than the current fiscal year projection — will be revised in December, in time for a legislative spending committee to make recommendations on state spending as lawmakers set the next budget.
“The forecast remains relatively unchanged, with a slight write down of $19.1 million, and I want to note that this actually feels like a big win for us,” said Comptroller Brooke Lierman, chair of the board, of the revisions to the fiscal 2026 revenue estimates.
Republicans were quick to disagree, saying “Marylanders should not be fooled by today’s numbers.”
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

“Our state’s fiscal picture looks ‘OK’ right now for one simple reason — Democrats in Annapolis raised taxes and fees on hardworking families and small businesses in the last legislative session,” said Senate Majority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore).
“There were no meaningful, long-term reforms to curb runaway spending, no effort to grow our economy and no real plan to keep Maryland competitive,” Hershey’s statement said. “A budget built on higher taxes and higher fees is not a sign of strength — it’s a sign of weakness.”
In March, the Board of Revenue Estimates approved a fiscal 2026 forecast that projected nearly $26.6 billion in revenue.
“If you think about where we were earlier this year, in February and March, we were very concerned about where things would be today in September,” Lierman said. “There were even discussions about the need for a special session if things really deteriorated, and we are not there, which is good.”
The new forecast, released Thursday, predicts more than a $110 million drop in income taxes, driven by lower-than-expected corporate taxes. The newest projections also lower sales tax collection estimates by $34.7 million and tobacco taxes by $19.7 million.
Those decreases were offset to a large degree by higher-than-expected individual income and insurance premium taxes, and miscellaneous revenues.
The new report does not consider the full effect of federal layoffs or a potential government shutdown next week. It also does not consider the effects of tax changes implemented earlier this year by the legislature.
Lierman and Board of Revenue Estimates Director Robert Rehrmann blamed the lower projections on Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which they called “OB Three.”
“But for OB three, we would be writing up our revenues,” Lierman said.
Rehrmann estimated the state would have exceeded March estimates by $100 million if not for the passage of Trump’s bill.
Hershey pointed a finger at Maryland Democrats.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Let’s be clear: Maryland’s challenges are not the result of Washington politics or past presidents. They are the direct consequence of one-party rule in Annapolis,” his statement said. “Maryland Democrats have built a high-tax, anti-growth economy that makes it harder for families to thrive and businesses to invest here. That’s not Trump’s fault — that’s theirs.”
Passage of Trump’s signature tax package extends and, in some cases, expands tax changes passed in 2017 in Trump’s first term.
One key change increases a deduction for state and local taxes from $10,000 to $40,000. The lower amount, a component of the 2017 law, benefited state tax collections by about an additional $300 million per year. The new law, with its higher deduction, will eliminate that bonus and lead to a $117.9 million decrease in fiscal 2026 revenues, falling to $71.4 million in fiscal 2027 and nearly $30 million the year after.
Revenues begin to tick up for three years starting in fiscal 2029, but nowhere near the amount to offset the $300 million annual gain under the 2017 law.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the General Assembly this year resolved a more than $3 billion deficit in the fiscal 2026 budget with one-time fund transfers, some budget cuts and $1.6 billion in tax and fee increases. At the time, Moore and lawmakers said the moves would leave the state with a nearly $150 million in fund balance.
Those efforts, however, do not erase the state’s ongoing structural budget issues. And the reduction in revenues from the federal tax changes will erase that projected fund balance and potentially leave a $200 million hole for lawmakers returning in January.
Maryland’s federal job losses climb to 15,100, the most in the nation

That figure does not include expected requests to cover overspending by state agencies and departments. Members of the House Appropriations Committee were warned earlier this week that many such requests were expected.
“The thing I’m more worried about is that we will be updating our spending forecast both for fiscal ’26 and ’27 to take into account deficiencies in ’26 and how that impacts ’27 estimates,” David Romans, a Department of Legislative Services budget analyst, told lawmakers Monday.
Romans said state agencies “reported being short” by about $250 million at the end of fiscal 2025.
“So, they’ll be paying those bills with fiscal ’26 dollars and are going to need a deficiency,” Romans said. “So, we already sort of know there’s going to be some additional costs.”
Lawmakers will have some flexibility, including $2.3 billion in the state’s rainy day fund.
“The significant amount of cash,” Romans said, will “help mitigate the impacts” of those deficiencies to a degree.

(Photo courtesy of Duke Sanford School of Public Policy)First, the big question. Is former U.S. Transportation Secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg going to run for president again?
Buttigieg told a Duke University audience Thursday that he doesn’t know. 
“I’m not just saying that because we’re supposed to be cagey,” he said during the question and answer portion of his appearance on campus sponsored by the Sanford School of Public Policy. 
When considering whether to run for an office, Buttigieg said he asks himself what the office calls for at the moment, what he offers, and whether those two things fit. 
His somber assessment of the state of the country and the world started with an acknowledgement of the “season of political violence” and the shooting deaths of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in Minnesota and conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. 
He continued with a summary of the upending of modern political norms.
“Big picture, we are in the middle of witnessing an energetic and largely successful attempt by people running our government not only to take full control of the levers of official policy and power in this country, but also to wield unprecedented levels of government control over the pillars of our civil society, including law, science, technology, medicine, entertainment, press, and academia,” he said. 
Buttigieg said he wasn’t discouraged despite all this, and told audience members they shouldn’t be either. 
Three principles
He offered three principles to “fashion something dramatically better.”
Don’t be wedded to the status quo and be willing to rethink and refashion aging organizations. “Good things are being destroyed right now,” he said. “Useless things are being destroyed alongside them. It is time to be rigorous and thoughtful about which is which and to think creatively about what to put in their place.”
Get back to basics. “We need to find ways to explain everything we believe in in terms of concrete results, and hold ourselves accountable for those results.”
Work across boundaries, which requires getting offline. “We’ve got to be connected in ways in which the algorithm simply will not support.”
Asked what he would do if he had 100 days to reform government, Buttigieg said he would get rid of Citizens United, a Supreme Court ruling that allows unlimited political spending by corporations, unions, and other outside groups. Buttigieg added that he’s not convinced the Supreme Court has the right number of justices or that the House of Representatives has the right number of members. 
Expectations for a gay presidential candidate
There was no mention of former presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s new book, where she wrote he was her first choice for a running mate and would have picked him if she thought the country was ready for a Black woman and gay man on a presidential ticket. 
In answer to a question, he described running as a gay presidential candidate in 2020. 
“You’re carrying the expectation of a community, but that’s not all you set out to do,” he said. “I wasn’t running to be a gay president. I ran for president because I thought the presidency was a way to achieve the things that I believe in. And I was gay. 
“Being able to be who you are. Being able to be as much or as little defined by that as you wanted to be. And just being able to live life and not get fired, or beat up, or worse. I just thought I’d be who I am. There were some people who thought I wasn’t being gay enough.”

Mostly embarrassed.","Throughout my three days spent navigating the packed halls of the Omni Hotel in New Haven at YIMBYtown – the premiere nationwide pro-homes conference, I felt a mixture of emotions.
Excited- to see old colleagues and meet new ones. Engaged – in the pursuit of sharing and learning new ways of thinking. Earnest – in the hope that the infectious energy of over 1,000 people might inspire real change in our narratives around the meaning of home. 
But mostly, I felt embarrassed. As the hosting state for YIMBYtown, Connecticut should have been leading the conversation. Our state leaders should have been on the main stage, sharing how we are creating new homes, strengthening protections for tenants, and preventing homelessness. Instead, the spotlight was on Connecticut for the Governor’s veto of H.B 5002,  the legislature’s unwillingness to call a vote on Just Cause Eviction protections, and other ways we are lagging behind our neighbors.
Meanwhile, attendees at the conference heard from numerous states who have managed to figure out how to tackle our country’s desperate need for new homes. On a panel entitled, “Pro Homes Wins in Red States,” presenters from Montana, Texas, Florida and Arkansas, shared how they managed to pass significant housing legislation, even in conservative political climates. Three of these states have passed policy allowing for commercial conversion opportunities; a provision Connecticut could have had if H.B 5002 had not been vetoed.
Our New England neighbor, Maine, tackled “local control” in 2022 through setting regional housing production goals. They did this by emphasizing to residents the economic impact of inaction on housing. Connecticut’s business community agrees with this evidence. Maine’s legislation also included the development of a Housing Opportunity Fund, providing $2 million in grants to municipalities for technical assistance and infrastructure aimed at creating new homes. Similar provisions were included in H.B 5002, but the veto left our state standing still, despite statewide and national research on how many families are struggling every day.
Listening to representatives from other states talk about their successes, it is easy to think “Well that won’t work for Connecticut” or “That will never happen here.” But this thinking is a fallacy. Connecticut is not unique. Our residents suffer from our inaction in the same way that families experience the effects of unaffordability and insecurity in any other place. NIMBYs, advocates for local control, and those fearful of change exist everywhere. What sets us apart from these other states is our unwillingness to hear beyond the loudest voices of opposition and do what is right for the lives of our current, and future, residents. 
The lessons from YIMBYtown are clear: Connecticut’s inaction on housing is unacceptable. We are not special. It is time for our legislature, and our governor, to pass strong, meaningful housing legislation that serves our families, our economy, and our future. We simply can’t wait.

After Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s months-long quest to eradicate autism spectrum disorder, he and his colleagues have apparently delivered on their promise to provide a so-called cure. This announcement is troubling considering that autism is not a disease.

Isabelle Farnham
Leucovorin, the drug Trump and his colleagues intend to use in autism treatments, normally offsets the toxic effects of cancer treatments, and boosts the amount of folic acid in the body. Evidence that leucovorin can have any effect on autistic behavior is limited, and the idea that this drug can remove autism – a neurotype passed down through genes – has no basis in reality. Medicines cannot remove characteristics of autism, nor can they alter any personality trait.
Up to this point, RFK and his associates have blamed vaccines for the recent rise in autism diagnoses. Now he claims that Tylenol use during pregnancy causes autism. Neither of these assertions are true. In actuality, this increase in diagnosis comes, at least in part, from growing awareness of what autism really is. For most of its history, autism has been underdiagnosed in girls and women, who often mask their autistic traits more successfully than their male counterparts due to social pressure. Underdiagnosis also disproportionately affects autistic people of color, whose characteristics are often ignored, misread or demonized by health professionals. As research on autism has expanded and knowledge has spread, diagnosis rates have naturally risen. These growing numbers reflect important advancements in the scientific world and indicate that more autistic people may be receiving the support they need.
RFK’s misinformation has contributed to measles outbreaks, chaos at the CDC, and a moment of misguided empowerment for the anti-vax movement. It has also put autistic people everywhere in danger, especially autistic children with high support needs (more commonly known as “low-functioning” autistics). Instead of receiving accommodation and assistance, these children will face even more judgement and contempt. Many children, whether autistic, disabled, or neither of the above, will lose life-saving healthcare. The misconception that autism is a disease rather than a neurotype – a way of being a person in the world – destroys and ends lives. Autism itself, though it can and often does present serious challenges, is not a curse, nor is it a death sentence.
If our society made room for its autistic population, providing compromise and understanding, the lives of autistic people everywhere would become not only more manageable, but happier and richer. These advancements might include more accessible diagnoses and mental health support, more diverse options in schooling and employment, and above all a shift in perception. Widespread, accurate information on autism and empathy for autistic people can vastly improve their lives. As a lower support needs (or “high-functioning”) autistic adult myself, I have felt this lack of kindness and understanding deeply throughout my life, in ways both big and small.
I have empathy, too, for the parents of struggling autistic children looking for a cure that does not exist, although their actions frustrate me and have devastating consequences for their families. These people, in their desperation and their need to provide happiness for their kids, have been taken advantage of by leaders with no regard for their well-being.
Autism, as the term “autism spectrum disorder” suggests, affects different individuals in profoundly different ways. However, I’m willing to bet that all autistic people – as well as their loved ones, communities, and society in general – would benefit from compassion. Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “answer to autism” shows no compassion, but rather bravado and a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue at hand. 
In order to soothe the suffering of autistic individuals and their families, we must listen to the wisdom of autistic voices, and we must lead with a willingness to learn and adapt. The answer to autism is empathy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-26 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut cannabis is safe. Here’s why that matters for patients.,Nikole Burnes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/26/connecticut-cannabis-is-safe-heres-why-that-matters/,"Connecticut’s medical cannabis program is safe, tightly regulated, and designed to protect people who rely on it.","We want patients and families to hear this first: Connecticut’s medical cannabis program is safe, tightly regulated, and designed to protect people who rely on it. 
Every product in the legal market is tracked, tested, and verified before it reaches a shelf. By contrast, the illegal market offers none of those protections. If safety is the goal, the regulated system is the only place that guarantees it.
Connecticut set one of the highest bars in the region when it built this program. Licensed producers operate under strict quality rules. Every lot is tested before sale. Dispensaries are run by pharmacists who counsel patients and watch for interactions. That structure has served this state well for more than a decade.
Recent media coverage has created confusion by implying that “clean” cannabis often means cannabis that was “zapped” to fix contamination. That framing is misleading. Prevention comes first in Connecticut. Facilities are designed to stay clean, teams are trained, and processes are validated so products meet standards from the start. 
When prevention is not enough, a second layer of protection exists to keep patients safe. That layer is remediation.
Remediation is a common, science-based safety step used across food and medicine. Milk is pasteurized. Spices and herbs are treated to reduce microbes that occur naturally in agriculture. Similar principles apply in cannabis. If a batch does not meet a limit, it is held back, corrected with an approved method, and retested. If it still does not meet every specification, it does not go to patients. That is not a loophole. It is how modern safety programs work.
Patients also deserve to know how often remediation is used. It is not the norm. It is a tool for exceptions. The baseline in licensed facilities is prevention and process control. When remediation is used, it must be validated and the finished product must pass all tests before release. That is the law and the practice in Connecticut.
Transparency helps people trust what they buy. We support clear, public guidance from the Department of Consumer Protection that explains which remediation methods are acceptable, how they are validated, and what post-process testing must show. We support easy access to Certificates of Analysis through QR codes on labels so patients can see that a lot met every limit at the time of sale. We also support ongoing roundtables with patients, clinicians, laboratories, producers, and regulators to keep standards strong and communication clear.
The illegal market is not a safe alternative. It does not test every lot. It does not label or track products. It does not offer pharmacist counseling or recall systems. Counterfeit vapes and unlabeled edibles from unregulated sources are the real risk. Directing patients away from the regulated market by sowing doubt through incomplete or technical claims increases harm, not safety.
Our message is simple. Connecticut cannabis is incredibly safe because prevention, testing, and accountability are built into the legal system. Remediation is a responsible backstop used when necessary to ensure products meet strict limits before sale, just as it is for common foods and medicines. Patients should feel confident that what they purchase in a licensed dispensary has been produced and verified under some of the toughest rules in our region.
We welcome honest debate and better public education. We also ask that commentary avoid leaving the impression that routine safety tools are shortcuts. Patients deserve clarity, not confusion. The best way to protect them is to keep strengthening the safeguards that already work: clean facilities, rigorous testing, pharmacist oversight, transparent information, and a regulated market that puts health first.

(Photo by John Cole/Capital-Star)Just days after securing the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s endorsement in the 2026 race for governor, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity took her campaign to the biggest swing county in the state.
“Pennsylvania deserves a fighter who works for them, not a politician with eyes on the White House,” Garrity said Thursday at the Newtown Sports & Event Center.
The event was part of her campaign’s week-long kickoff dubbed the “Help is on the Way” tour, with rallies taking place in five regions of the commonwealth.
Throughout her roughly 10-minute stump speech, Garrity often described incumbent Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro as an elected official more concerned with running for higher office as opposed to addressing the needs of Pennsylvanians.
“For Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania is a stepping stone,” Garrity said. “And for all of us, Pennsylvania is our home.”
Garrity, who is serving her second term as state treasurer, highlighted her small town roots in Bradford County, background in business and her military service.
She also touted the work the state treasurer’s office has done delivering for taxpayers and criticized Shapiro for the ongoing budget impasse.
During her speech, Garrity pinpointed areas of policy where she would advocate for change, if elected. She said she would “unleash energy responsibly,” in the state and cited natural gas under the feet of Pennsylvanians.
She also said fighting crime would be a focus and vowed to work alongside President Donald Trump.
“I will be a partner with President Trump and not a roadblock to make sure our streets are safe,” Garrity said. “So, whether it’s Philadelphia, Pittsburgh or Punxsutawney, when I’m your governor … you’ll see real action in your communities. We need to keep our streets safe.”
Garrity vowed to expand education savings accounts, protect charter schools, and reform public schools.
“It’s time for a governor who actually gets stuff done,” Garrity said, taking a not-so-veiled jab at Shapiro’s “get stuff done” catchphrase.
In a statement, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party linked Garrity to Trump’s agenda and claimed she can’t be trusted to fight on behalf of Pennsylvanians.
“Stacy Garrity has pledged her complete support for Donald Trump’s agenda and has fully embraced a plan that is raising costs, killing jobs, and cutting health care for the people of Southeastern Pennsylvania,” Chairman Eugene DePasquale said in a statement to the Capital-Star.
Shapiro, who was elected governor in 2022 with a double-digit victory over GOP nominee Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), has consistently held positive approval ratings for his job performance.
National ratings outlets like the Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections view Shapiro as the favorite, with each predicting the outcome of the race as a “likely Democratic” victory.
“Defeating Josh Shapiro is not going to be easy,” Garrity said. “But I never back down from a challenge. Not in business, not in service to our country, and not as your state treasurer.”
Bucks County has the distinction of being a county that Shapiro and Garrity both won in their most recent successful campaigns.
Garrity is the only candidate in the GOP race, although Mastriano has not ruled out a 2026 run for the office.
The 2026 primary in Pennsylvania will take place on May 19.
National Guard deployment
Since being sworn in for a second term, Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee in what he calls an effort to combat crime. Garrity said she would support the deployment of guard soldiers to the commonwealth.
Shapiro has criticized Trump for the deployments and told reporters last week that it is his “hope that it will not get to that here in Pennsylvania.”
“I can tell you that we are preparing aggressively on that front,” Shapiro said in Delaware County last Wednesday.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, held a series of events last week where he lambasted the possibility of Trump deploying the National Guard to the state’s biggest city.
Garrity views it differently.
“I’m retired military police. I have a law enforcement background, so whatever we need to do to make our state’s streets safe is vitally important,” she told reporters on Thursday.
“So, if that means deputizing retired police officers or some of the local folks, that’s fine,” she added. “If it means we need the National Guard, that’s fine too. I’ve worked very closely with the National Guard and the Army Reserve. They’re extremely professional.”
A plea to vote by mail
Before Garrity took the stage, multiple candidates for office and elected officials pleaded with attendees to consider voting by-mail in upcoming elections.
During a successful 2024 cycle, Republicans advocated for vote-by-mail as a part of their “Swamp the Vote” strategy. As a result, Republicans increased their share of voting by mail in the 2024 election, although Democrats still vote by mail in larger numbers.
In August, Trump posted that he was going to “lead a movement” to end mail-in voting.
“I don’t like mail-in voting, but mail-in voting is what we have right now in the state of Pennsylvania, and so we’re gonna have to embrace it until we have a change in the governor’s mansion,” Garrity said in response to a question from the Capital-Star.
“So if you don’t embrace mail-in voting, that’s like being in a hundred-yard dash and giving your opponent a 50-yard head start,” she added. “So while it’s here to stay, I think we have to do everything that we can to embrace it.”
Garrity pointed to Florida being a model for elections. 
SEPTA stop-gap
On Sept. 8, Shapiro announced that he was directing state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll to approve the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority’s (SEPTA) request to use $394 million of its capital budget – money designated for infrastructure and vehicles – from the Public Transportation Trust Fund (PTTF) for operating expenses. It’s a two-year funding stop-gap for SEPTA.
Mass transit, particularly SEPTA, was a major topic of discussion for the Pennsylvania General Assembly over the past few months.
Garrity told the Capital-Star that she would have preferred the solution that Senate Republicans proposed and passed in August.
“We want SEPTA funded, but it would have also taken care of our roads and bridges, so it helped all 67 counties,” she added.

Wes Moore (D) speaks with reporters Thursday at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual legislative conference in Washington, D.C. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) has said repeatedly that his beef with President Donald Trump (R) isn’t personal. But it’s clear from Moore’s comments to reporters Thursday at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual legislative conference that he and the president aren’t exactly pals, either.
The governor took about 15 minutes to speak with reporters, answering the now-obligatory question about a presidential bid — he again said he’s not running, in case you’ve been asleep for the last few months — but also talking about what he called the Trump administration’s “assault” on democracy and the president’s war on working families.
Moore pointed to the president’s proposal to do away with mail-in ballots as just one facet of his assault on democracy. “Why do you think that’s happening? It’s happening because they think they have a better chance of doing voter intimidation if you actually have to show up at the voting booth,” Moore said.

“Why do they think that they are trying to put National Guards inside of our communities and our streets and our neighborhoods? So people can get comfortable with the idea of having people walking around in military uniforms, and so they can surround voting booths,” he said. “This is a very intentional thing that they are doing.”
Moore was also asked about the possibility of a federal government shutdown, something he said Trump has been trying to do since he began his latest term. Maryland leads the nation with more than 15,000 federal jobs lost since January.
The governor said the state continues to help laid-off federal workers find jobs in the private sector and in the state’s classrooms to help ease a teacher shortage.
“We are going to continue being aggressive. We are going to continue being creative,” he said. “This battle that the president just seems to be content on waging on working families. It continues, and it continues with a speed that is absolutely offensive, particularly for those who actually care about the middle class.”
After Moore spoke with reporters, he went to do a radio interview with the Black Information Network. Before he put on a headset, the governor was warmly greeted by conference attendees.
Moore is scheduled to return to D.C. on Saturday for one of the conference’s main events, the Phoenix Awards. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is also scheduled to attend, which would mark her second straight year at the event.
Remembering Sue Hecht
Tributes were flowing in Thursday for former Del. Sue Hecht, a Democrat who represented the Frederick area for three terms, from 1995 through the aughts, and who was remembered as a role model for elected women who followed in her footsteps. Hecht died Tuesday, Sept. 23, at age 77.
Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) called Hecht “a true trailblazer who led with compassion and conviction. Sue broke barriers for women in politics and mentored so many who followed in her path. Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater called Hecht a “dear friend and an incredible leader in our community.”
Former Del. Sue Hecht, a Democrat from Frederick, died Tuesday at age 77.
“Sue led with compassion, vision, and tenacity and was truly a champion for Frederick County,” Fitzwater said in a social media post. “She was a role model for so many local elected officials, especially women — blazing the trail and breaking glass ceilings.”
C. Sue Hecht was born in Takoma Park in 1947. She attended Frederick Community College and Hood College, where she received a bachelor’s degree in management, and earned an MBA from Frostburg State University, where she briefly taught. From 1986 to 1997, she was executive director of Heartly House, a Frederick County shelter for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, was a member of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault for the same period, and was a co-founder of the Frederick County Domestic ViolenceTask Force, among many other positions.
Hecht was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1994 and reelected in 1998, serving as a member of the Appropriations Committee and, in her second term, as deputy majority whip. She ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2002, losing to incumbent Republican Sen. Alex Mooney, before running for House again in 2006 and regaining her seat. She did not seek reelection in 2010.
As recently as last year, Hecht was working to help elect U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) Nancy Lineman, who served as communications director for former House Speaker Michael Busch, said the first campaign she ever worked on was Hecht’s, which solidified her “love of politics and policy.”
“She was the truest of true public servants. A life well lived and unending giving to her community and constituents,” Lineman said in a social media post. “I was lucky to know her and learn from her.”
Are we sure this time? We’re sure
After counting the Annapolis City primary ballots, and then ordering a hand recount, city and Anne Arundel County election officials confirmed Thursday that the “final” election results posted Tuesday were unchanged and the winners and losers stand.
The only race where a recount might have made a difference was in the Ward 4 council race, where Democrats Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson and Coren Eve Makell were separated by just four votes in their race. The recount confirmed that Allsup-Johnson had edged Makell for the Democratic nomination by a vote of 144 to 140.

The Annapolis Board of Canvassers voted in emergency session Wednesday to conduct the recount, in part because of the razor-thin margin of the Ward 4 race and in part because of an election night error that switched results for candidates in the Ward 6 race. The error, which was discovered and corrected before results were reported Tuesday, gave Diesha Contee’s votes to Craig Cussimanio and vice versa. The audit confirmed the numbers reported Tuesday, with Contee receiving 185 votes to Cussimanio’s 124.
“We apologize to all the candidates and especially Ms. Contee and Mr. Cussimanio for the error,” said Board of Canvassers Chair Eileen Leahy in a statement Thursday. “We found the error through our normal procedures, and remedied the mistake, then we expeditiously conducted the audit to give voters and candidates confidence in the outcome.”
Beside Allsup-Johnson and Contee, the — now official — winners in the other contested races were Harry Huntley in Ward 1, Keanuú Smith-Brown in Ward 3 and Jared Littmann in the mayor’s race. All eight council seats were up, but only four were contested.
The audit began Thursday morning at Anne Arundel County Board of Elections offices in Glen Burnie, where workers “retabulated the results of paper ballots from in-person, mail-in, drop-box, and provisional ballots cast in the primary.” The whole process took about 2.5 hours at a cost of about $1,300, which the county board paid for.
The winners still have to get through the general election on Nov. 4, and the winners of that election will be sworn in on Dec. 1.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gov.-Wes-Moore-9-25-2025-1024x921.jpg,,,2025-09-26 03:56:13.993931

During his time in Bethel, Begich sat down at KYUK with News Director Sage Smiley to talk about what he’s hearing from constituents and his thoughts on how federal policies play out on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length. You can listen to the full interview here.
KYUK (Sage Smiley): Thank you so much for joining us today Rep. Begich, you have been doing a little tour of the [Yukon-Kuskokwim] Delta; you were in Aniak yesterday. Tell us a bit about how that’s been. What have you been hearing from constituents? What have you been up to?     
Rep. Nick Begich III visits KYUK in Bethel on Sept. 23, 2025. (Photo by Samantha Watson/KYUK Public Media)

Rep. Nick Begich III: Yeah, you know, we came out here yesterday. We did stay the night last night in Aniak, and we had an opportunity to meet with [The Kuskokwim Corporation], with folks from Calista, with folks from Donlin [Gold], with folks from the school district. And what we’re really trying to do is understand the community needs in a holistic sense, right? And really understand how these organizations are working together, what their capacities are, and then also, what are some of the gaps that they need some assistance in filling.
KYUK: What are you hearing from them, what are the biggest priorities for these communities?
Begich: Yeah, you know, I think there’s been a lot of concern around federal funding, certainly that’s been on people’s minds, and it’s a reasonable thing to be concerned about. There’s a lot of reliance in not just this part of the region or this part of the state, but the entire state with respect to federal fund flows. And as we’re starting to see in [Washington, D.C.] a tightening of the belt, it’s impacting people across the United States. But for the states that are most federally dependent, and Alaska is one of, if not the most federally dependent state in the country, it’s certainly got folks concerned. And so what we have said from the start and continue to say, and what we were talking about yesterday: if there are issues specifically that are concerning, that we can address and try to raise flags with administrative officials in [Washington, D.C.], let us know, and let us know early so that we can get ahead of some of those decisions before they get handed down.
KYUK: That leads very well into one of my next questions, which was: many people here do rely on federal assistance programs, whether that’s Medicaid, whether that’s [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], and our regional tribal health consortium, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, they have said that 38% of their budget comes from Medicaid. So as you’re traveling around and talking to people, how are you sort of explaining your support for the Big Beautiful Bill, for your support for pulling back these things as it is a really important part of the budget of our health corporation, for example?
Begich: I think it’s a really great question, and there’s been a lot, in my opinion, of mischaracterization around what these adjustments were. So let me explain a couple of things about the adjustments. So we’ll start with [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], and then I’ll talk about Medicaid.
So for [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], specifically, historically, the federal government has paid 100% of [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] payments to the state, so full reimbursement passed through from each state to the federal government in terms of [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] liability. What has happened, though, is because there’s no real skin in the game for the states, is that some states like Alaska have had a very high, what they call improper payment rate. So that’s payments that were made in the improper amount, or payments that should never have been made were made. And in the case of Alaska, we have a lot of people who should be getting support on [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], and haven’t been, and so they have a formula and to determine that improper payment rate, and Alaska is the worst in the nation. We have – not in this last year, but the year before – we were over 60% of the payments in [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] were improper. And so that’s being improved. I think we’re down in the 20% level, but we’re still the worst in the country. And so what the federal government said was, ‘Look, we got to have some accountability among the states.’ And so the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] doesn’t change.
People who were eligible before are still eligible today. But what did change was that the states need to pay 5% you know, instead of zero, into the program, and so if a state continues to have high improper payment rates, there’s penalties associated with that. So that’s intended to incentivize states to get it right. And Alaska, even recently, in the news, has recognized that and has started hiring people who are experts at [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] compliance to ensure that we’re taking care of the backlog of folks who have been waiting for [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits, and they’re accelerating that so now we appear to have a more responsive situation where we’re going to bring those payment improper payment rates down to a manageable level, which will be better for people in the long run anyway in the state.
When you talk about Medicaid; so Medicaid, there’s, you’ve got to think about this this way. There are two populations of Medicaid. There’s a traditional Medicaid population, and then there’s what they call the expanded Medicaid population. The work in [Washington, D.C.] this last year did not affect anyone in the traditional Medicaid population, so folks who are disabled, single moms, kids, those low income families are not impacted by anything happening in the Medicaid program. What is impacted is part of the expanded Medicaid population. Within that population, there’s three groups that were addressed, three categories of spending within expanded Medicaid as a part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. There are folks who are in the country illegally that were receiving Medicaid support, not in Alaska so much, but in other states like California. There’s been a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse, and so we’re tightening some of the controls around the program to reduce that.
But then the last piece was what they called the work requirement. So for able-bodied folks. So these are, again, not part of the traditional Medicaid population, but for able-bodied folks who could be working but are choosing not to work, they have until 2028 to either find a job or start looking for work. Now it’s important to recognize that there are excluded categories in this work requirement, so I’ll mention a few of them here. If someone is a caregiver to a family member or a friend, they’re excluded from the work requirement because we deem that as work. If someone says, ‘Look, I’m not in an area or in a position where there’s opportunities for me to work. I’m able-bodied, but that’s not where I’m at.’ There’s a volunteer option, so someone can volunteer 20 hours a week and that’s considered full-time work. If someone is a senior who’s getting a Medicaid supplement, then they are also excluded from the requirement. And if someone is in a county or borough that is one-and-a-half times the national unemployment rate, they’re also excluded, which includes a lot of rural Alaska.
KYUK: Even in unincorporated boroughs?
Begich: If, yes, if it’s a borough it counts. But also important, and this is probably one of the most important things for rural Alaskans to know is that if somebody is Alaska Native or American Indian or Hawaiian Native, they’re excluded, because we have a treaty trust obligation, and Medicaid is an important supplement to [Indian Health Service], and [Indian Health Service] has been chronically underfunded for a long time, so a lot of the health consortiums and providers in Alaska rely on who service, the Native population rely on Medicaid as a gap between what [Indian Health Service] pays and what they need in order to run their operations. So all those categories are excluded from the work requirement. And so when you look at those categories and the expanded Medicaid population, you’re really talking best data that I’ve got right now is about 7% that that would apply to.
KYUK: The state of Alaska recently petitioned the [U.S.] Supreme Court to rule on rural subsistence priority, specifically here on the Kuskokwim [River]. I’m wondering where you fall on that issue. What do you think about rural subsistence priority?
Begich: I think there should be a rural subsistence priority. And I think it’s important because when you’re out here in parts of the state that are off the road system, I mean, let me back up a little bit. When I’m in Washington, D.C., and I talk to my colleagues about rural, they think rural is a long trip down a road. But I have to explain to them, if that’s rural then we’re ultra-rural. We are beyond rural. We are not connected to the roads. Many parts of our state will never be connected to our roads for a variety of reasons: because of the terrain, topology, the size of a community, justifying a road, resources in that area that would justify a road. So we have to think differently and be treated differently up here. So when you’re in one of those communities, you should have my opinion, this is Nick’s opinion, but you should have a priority for the rural food resource that you need in order to survive in the community. And so I think it makes sense, and that’s where I fall on it.
KYUK: Some rural school districts, including in the [Yukon-Kuskokwim] Delta, rely on J-1 or H-1B visas to bring in teachers to help supplement education in these rural areas. And with the changes [to visas], I know that some school districts are concerned. What are you hearing from them? Or what do you feel like you can do at the federal level to help mitigate those concerns?
Begich: Yes, and we, we’ve raised this concern with the administration, and it is, I do support the ability to bring in J-1s and H-1Bs to support as a supplement to local Alaskans and Americans generally, the education workforce in rural Alaska. We know that it’s a hard job to fill, and when you’ve got positions that go unfilled it means that kids are going uneducated. So we need to make sure that we have teachers in the classroom. I met a teacher this morning in Aniak and she was telling me her story. She thought she would come to Alaska, it would be an exciting experience. She’s on a J-1 visa from, I believe, the Philippines, and she was, she was here for the first year, and said, ‘Okay, I’m gonna go somewhere else in America.’ And then she realized just what an impact she was making to these kids. And she’s on her fifth year here, and it’s rewarding work for her, and she’s really integrated into the community. We need that.
And you know, I’ve had conversations with others in the school district here in the last couple of days, and I’ve heard it from others around the state. But it was good to meet some of the educators who’ve come over from their home countries to rural Alaska, and they’ve become an important part of the workforce here to make sure that the kids have opportunities.
KYUK: How do you balance your support for development projects in this region – the one top of mind is obviously Donlin Gold, supported by Calista and [The Kuskokwim Corporation] – with the potential concerns or impact to subsistence fishing and hunting, to the environment more broadly?
Begich: It’s a great question, and I think it’s a question we will never stop asking and answering as Alaskans. Last week, I was on the House Natural Resources subcommittee for oversight, and I sit on that subcommittee. We had two panels, eight Alaskans that came down from Alaska to testify before Congress to talk about some of these topics and what was really interesting, because the majority party and the minority party have an opportunity to call their respective witnesses in. So we heard from Democrats and Republicans both on the committee, but every Alaskan agreed that Alaskans are pro-development and pro-environment. And there is no one outside of Alaska that will take better care of Alaska than an Alaskan will do.
So I think that was really important for others to hear that in Alaska these two things, while they may appear in conflict to some folks, they’re really harmonics to each other, and in some respects, having the resources come into the region may allow us to do a better job of taking care of the environment that we have. So I was recently up in Red Dog outside Kotzebue, and just to see the shareholder hire that’s been prioritized there for so many years, it’s been transformational for the economy there. It’s given people a lot of opportunities. And as some folks listening may know already, the fish that come up that stream up into Red Dog – there were no fish before Red Dog came. They cleaned the water up so much that the fish came back because it was naturally polluted by the deposit that was out there. So that, I think that’s a really interesting example of how a lot of times resource development in the modern era can be used to actually improve environmental outcomes.
And, yeah, so I’m encouraged by it, you know, I recognize, having been to some of the villages yesterday, the opportunities in some of these areas just aren’t there. There just are not economic opportunities. It’s a continuous grant funding hope and prayer that someone will approve a grant or get a congressionally directed spending request back to a village to keep it alive for a few more years. The best way to keep our communities alive is to make sure there’s economic opportunity. Donlin [Gold] is one of those kinds of projects that brings generational opportunities to the region.
KYUK: This is a bit of a multi-part question. So bypass mail is a really important part of goods handling in this region, and the cost of energy, the cost of goods do continue to go up. I’m wondering, number one, what your opinion on bypass mail is, and then number two, what sort of other solutions you’re looking at, at the federal level to help assist this region, which has really high energy costs and really high cost of pretty much everything –
Begich: Yeah.
KYUK: – to help bring those down and make it sustainable.
Begich: Really good, really important topic to cover. First of all, [Essential Air Service] was on the chopping block, and so we heard about that in early conversations and raised huge alarm bells. And I know that the senators did too. So we are all on the same page for supporting Essential Air Service, which is connected to our ability to deliver bypass mail. Recently, we saw there were some price increase proposals from the Post Office for bypass mail, and I joined a letter with the senators to push back on that and say, ‘Look, you know, you don’t understand the impact that you’re making to rural communities in Alaska, and we can’t absorb those kinds of price increases.’ So we’re working on pushing back against those price increases because we recognize that there’s no other way to get essential goods out here, right, in an economic fashion.
Anyway, one of the things that’s been a challenge, and I’ve seen this personally in different parts of the state, is trying to bring groceries into communities where the community can really only sustain one grocer, and so there’s international grocers that come into parts of Alaska, and they’re engaging sometimes in monopolistic practices that make it very difficult for people to get a fair price and a reasonable price for for groceries. And so what we saw in Aniak was a store run by [The Kuskokwim Corporation] where they’re not motivated to try to generate a profit from the community. They’re motivated to make sure that they keep people honest and they keep a fair price, and I think that’s really important. It was encouraging to see the model, but it is tough. Running a grocery store in rural Alaska is tough, but it’s tougher as a community resident to eke out a living in these parts of the state if you’ve only got one provider.
You touched on energy. So one of the things that I think is important is that in rural parts of Alaska, where we have micro grids. Micro grids running purely on diesel are not the most cost efficient structure. So in other parts of the state, you have wind and solar augmenting with some now battery systems that come in, that’s good, and it demonstrably lowers the cost when you don’t have to bring the fuel in. And so we need to use that model that’s being used in other parts of the state, where you can and plug in solar, and if it makes sense, wind, but definitely solar into these micro grid systems so that we don’t have to pay as much on the diesel fuel costs for the diesel fuel consumption. So when you talk just at a high level, you know there’s what’s driving the cost of living in rural Alaska. You have food, energy, and housing, and those are the three things.
And one of the things, so in the final category, housing, that we have worked to do early on is we passed HR43, which allowed for some of the lands that are in a number of these villages that have been locked up in a municipal land trust to be returned to the villages. And this was something that Don Young worked on, and my predecessor, Mary Peltola, worked on, and we were happy to work on too, and we were able to get it over the finish line. So hopefully that’ll open up some lands that are attractive in some of these villages that just haven’t been able to be developed for either community purposes or for new housing, because you’ve got, obviously, generations of people that are often living in the same home stacked on top of each other, and while we all love each other and we love our family, that’s not always the easiest thing for folks, we want to make sure they have the ability to to get housing in their own community.
KYUK: And you see that as a federal solution to the housing crunch that exists here in the [Yukon-Kuskokwim] Delta?
Begich: Well, that’s one solution. That’s part of the solution. But giving, getting people their land is not, is not the be all, end all. So there’s federal funding programs that are part of [Indian Health Service], there’s federal funding programs that are part of [U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development], there are state programs. And so these various grant sources, one of the challenges that my team and I have realized is that a lot of these programs come with challenging strings or challenging barriers, right? And so you’ll talk to folks who are responsible for housing in a particular region, and they’re saying, ‘Look, I can get grant money from here and a loan from here, and I might be able to get it, get some additional third party match from here.’ And they’re stitching together this strange patchwork quilt of requirements that makes it very difficult for them to even get a single house built. And so we’re looking for people to help us identify what those barriers are and see if there’s some, maybe some legislative fixes to some of those barriers so that the programs can plug into each other a little bit more effectively.
KYUK: In July, you voted to pull back previously committed funds from public broadcasting, which impacts stations all over the U.S., including KYUK and KSKO upriver in McGrath, [here at KYUK] we’re looking at cutting $700,000 just from salaries and benefits this fiscal year. And so I’m wondering if you could walk us through that decision of support for rescission for public broadcasting.
Begich: Yeah, so the rescissions request that came over – so let me just back up how, just explain at a macro level how rescissions operate. So under the the Budget Control Act of 1974, Congress and the executive have an opportunity to work together on two categories, one’s called deferrals and one is called rescissions. Prior to that Budget Control Act, the President could just decide to rescind funds at will and or defer funds until the end of the fiscal year, at which time they wouldn’t be utilized, which was sort of a backdoor way to rescind until the next fiscal year. So Congress decided to put this in place, and it was signed into law, and it provides a process by which the executive branch can then send a package of rescissions. And so it’s not a line item set of rescissions, it’s a group of rescissions. So a group of rescissions was sent over as a singular bill to the House and Senate, and it included about $8 billion of [U.S. Agency for International Development] rescissions, as well as [National Public Radio] and [Public Broadcasting Service] rescissions, which were about a billion dollars. So what was rescinded in that package was not the current fiscal year, but it was future funding for those two categories.
So the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and [Public Broadcasting Service] had been forward funded from their portion of government funding for the next two fiscal years. So those two fiscal years were pulled back, and we were only funding this fiscal year. If we do a [continuing resolution], which is likely, we will see what happens. That might be a future question on your list, I don’t know, but if we do a continuing resolution through November, then there’ll be a discussion about whether that includes the things that were previously rescinded or not, and that will probably be more in the weeds. I don’t know the answer to that question yet.
We haven’t seen yet what the answer to that’s going to be. But when you looked at the entire package, I had to make a decision about, ‘Okay, what do we do with $9 billion in spending? Do we rescind it or do we not?’ And something that I’ve campaigned on, and I’ve talked a lot about, was I believe we’re sending too much of our American tax dollar resources overseas when we know we have a significant national budget deficit. So you don’t get to decide which particular category you vote on. You have to vote on the entire block. So I chose to vote yes for the rescission.
What is, what’s important to recognize, however, is that there’s $100 million fund that’s dedicated to emergency response that Alaska will continue to be able to receive funds for the [Public Broadcasting Service] funding, my understanding is it’s about 17% of funds came from the federal government for for [Public Broadcasting Service], but 1% for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting –
KYUK: for [National Public Radio].
Begich: – for [National Public Radio]. Thanks.
KYUK: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting got most of its money from the federal government.
Begich: Okay, so what’s been encouraging to see, though, is how the public has responded. And we’ve seen this in other areas as well as things have gotten a little tighter in [Washington, D.C.], you know, folks who are patrons have stepped forward, and we’ve seen $3.5 million dollars. I think in the first several weeks that the real hard push for raising capital has occurred, there’s been about $3.5 million, which is, I think half, I’ve been told anyway, half of the budget gap. So I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to see some private funds come in and pick up where the federal government left off and keep the stations running and on online.
KYUK: Would you support restoring federal funding for public broadcasting?
Begich: You know, we’d have to take a look at it specifically. You know, it’s all within the context of what other things get rolled up into a single bill decision, because very seldom do we have the ability to vote on just that item. But I think broadcasting is important. There’s no doubt about that. People remain, particularly in rural Alaska, they remain connected through radio, but it would just depend on what it’s attached to.
KYUK: It’s the final days of the federal fiscal year. We’re looking at a potential government shutdown. For lack of a better way, to not be blunt, why visit the [Yukon-Kuskokwim] Delta now in these final days of the federal fiscal year?
Begich: Well, first of all, it’s important, right? And there’s never a perfect time to do a trip like this, because you’re definitely outside of [Washington, D.C.] But no one’s in [Washington, D.C.] right now, the House and the Senate have recessed for the week, and so we come back to our districts around the country and we visit the people that we need to visit, right? Our constituents, and they’re telling us: here’s the things that we need. So if you spend too much time in [Washington, D.C.], then you’re going to become [Washington, D.C.] So it’s important that we take time out and come back home and hear from people before we go make decisions on their behalf. So I think that’s important.
But the House passed the continuing resolution to fund government. So I’m in the House and we passed that successfully, and went over to the Senate. The Senate tried to pass. It did not get through. They had two different versions, one from the Republicans, one from the Democrats, both failed, and so the Senate adjourned for the week and will be back next week.
But it is concerning. I don’t think that we need to be playing games with government funding. And you know that the House is ready to pass a clean, what they call a clean [continuing resolution], which is a continuation of the previous fiscal year forward for a couple of months, while we let the regular order, what we call regular order, or, you know, the appropriations process, work through, give it some time to work through. So we have three appropriations bills out of 12 that have passed, both the House and Senate have been sent to conference, and those are being worked on in a negotiated way, what they call the four corners. So you got two of those corners are Republicans and two are Democrats, one in the Senate, one in the House. They’re negotiating out what those appropriations bills will look like in the final form between the two chambers, but both chambers did pass them. Now you say three out of 12 doesn’t sound like a lot, but it represents more than half of the actual federal spending within those three bills. So it is a significant chunk. I think a lot of folks are getting tired of the [continuing resolution] process. Continuing resolutions don’t offer many opportunities for us to bring back targeted monies for our districts, because you’re just continuing the previous fiscal year. So if you got a project that needs to get done, it’s very hard to get it funded in the current methodology. So we do, I believe we need to get back to again, what they call regular order, which is passage of the appropriations bills through the appropriations process. And hopefully this will give us some time to do that.
KYUK: Final question: you are busy. You’re doing a lot of travel. Some of my colleagues in journalism may say you’re a little bit tough to get an interview with. Why interview with KYUK?
Begich: Well, I’m here, and I have time in my schedule. Let’s do it. You asked for an interview. Let’s do an interview. I mean, we, I do a lot of interviews. I do a lot of radio and I do a lot of print interviews as well. Some of those are national. Some of those are local. You know, I’ll tell you this just straight up. There are a couple of news sources in the state of Alaska that I don’t do a lot of interviews with because I don’t feel like we get a fair opportunity to share our side of the story. Radio is different.
Radio allows us to have a robust one on one conversation where we can drill down in issues and it’s longer form. A lot of times in print, I’ll give someone a quote that might be three paragraphs and get one sentence in, and the sentence may or may not be what I believe is the full picture. What we’re doing today, we have an opportunity to drill down. And I really appreciate the long-form opportunities, because it allows us to provide context to what’s happening in [Washington, D.C.] How does it impact us? What are the concerns in the community? We can have a fuller discussion in this format.
KYUK: Is there anything we didn’t touch on that you want to add?
Begich: You know, I’m excited for the opportunities that we have as a state. You know, in every administration, Democrat or Republican, there’s going to be chances for Alaska to have a certain perspective shared. And under this administration, we have an opportunity to really open up chances for people in rural Alaska.
When I was in a village yesterday, outside Aniak, I was talking with a grandmother and this grandmother’s son and daughter-in-law and kids just left for Anchorage, and they wanted to stay in the village, but they didn’t have an opportunity out there to really build the life that they were envisioning for themselves. You know, I want to see more opportunities for people to stay in rural Alaska, and those opportunities come from the private side, long-term, sustainably. What we’re seeing right now statewide, again, is kind of a microcosm of what we’re seeing nationwide, where, if you have communities that are really reliant on the federal government, and the federal government runs out of money, it’s a huge risk, and it’s a huge risk for Alaska.
So in this moment, I think it’s important for us to advocate for ourselves, for not just continuing federal funding, that’s understandable, but to open up an additional aspect to our economy, the private side that creates additional jobs and allows those monies to circulate and lets our lets us keep our people where they want to be, which is in their traditional communities.
KYUK: Well, thank you very much for your time Rep. Begich.
Begich: Thank you.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0)An Arizona Republican state lawmaker on Wednesday called for the execution of a Democratic congresswoman from Washington state because she urged people upset with President Donald Trump to protest in the streets.
Rep. John Gillette, R-Kingman, wrote on the social media site X that U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was calling for the the government to be overthrown and should be hanged.
“Until people like this, that advocate for the overthrow of the American government are tried convicted and hanged.. it will continue,” Gillette said in response to a video of Jayapal.
That clip uploaded to X was from a longer video, which was posted online in March, that is part of Jayapal’s “Resistance Lab” series in which she and others discuss protest movements and non-violent actions. The session in question featured a speaker who studied political violence and spoke about non-violence.
The post Gillette responded to claimed that Jayapal was making a call to violence because she said protesters should be “strike ready” and “street ready.” The Arizona Mirror watched the video in its entirety and found no calls to violence or advocating for overthrowing the government; it was focused on “non-violent resistance” to Trump and advising people on how to do that.
In contrast, Gillette has expressed support for the Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, who violently assaulted police officers and broke down doors and windows in order to access the building so they could stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. In several posts on X, he called the 1,600 or so people who were prosecuted — and since pardoned by Trump — for their actions that day “political prisoners.”
He refused to answer questions when the Mirror reached him by phone on Thursday.
“You guys aren’t known for putting out accurate information,” Gillette said. “The comment is what it is, it is on the post. You can see what it is, there is no hidden meaning. No nothing. You report whatever you want to report. We are done. Stop calling me. Have a good day.”
Gillette then hung up and he did not respond to follow up questions texted to him about the post. A representative for Jayapal said that she is out of the country and currently unable to comment.
One of Gillette’s Democratic colleagues in the Arizona House of Representatives said the Kingman Republican’s call for an elected official to be put to death for exercising their First Amendment right was appalling.
“The Congresswoman was clearly talking about nonviolent protest and legal strikes — absolutely nothing violent,” Assistant House Democratic Leader Nancy Gutierrez said in a statement to the Mirror. “Representative Gillette misconstrued her words to once again put a target on a political opponent’s back, calling for her to be hanged. What will he need to say before Republican leadership in the House takes action? This is language that leads to violence. I’m tired of him putting us and our families at risk.”
Gillette’s recent comments come after some of his democratic colleagues have voiced concerns over his rhetoric after he castigated them for calling for civility and unity in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In a message to all his fellow lawmakers that included a racial slur, he placed blame for political violence solely on Democrats and the political left, accusing them of stoking hate and violence against Republicans.
“The tone was set by your party; unity is no longer an option,” Gillette wrote to the 59 other members of the state House. “We handed you an olive ranch (sic), and you broke it. Your party invited the radicals to the table and they took over. Now you own them. As the J**s did at Peral (sic) Harbor, Radical Muslims on 911, your party has woken the sleeping giant.”
He has also recently come under fire for Islamophobic comments that led to an ethics complaint that was ultimately dismissed. The Republican chair of the House Ethics Committee said that Gillette had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted on social media without consequence.
Jeff Sharlet, a professor at Dartmouth and author of “The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War,” said he was “wary” to call Gillette’s words a direct call to violence, but said the comments were still worrying and part of a larger trend.
“I think it is grotesque what he is saying. I would be afraid that someone would maybe act on it,” Sharlet said, adding that if he were a Democratic politician who had to work with Gillette, he may be nervous. “If he got anywhere near the Congresswoman he is targeting, I’d want security to take notice.”
Discussions around political violence have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with high-profile conservatives laying blame on their political opponents and their rhetoric.
“We are having a punctuated burst — a historically high period of political violence that I would call America’s era of violent populism,” Dr. Robert Pape, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has studied political violence for 30 years, told the Mirror.
In June, Pape penned an op-ed in The New York Times saying that the country was on the brink of an “extremely violent era” in American politics.
“We are now … in the eye of the storm I was worried about,” Pape said.
Pape runs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, a nonpartisan research center. In May, Pape’s organization found that 40% of Democrats supported the use of force to remove Trump and 25% of Republicans supported the use of military against anti-Trump protests, double what the numbers were last fall.
That violent rhetoric used by Gillette also could have an unintended consequence on him and his political allies, Pape said.
“It is going to push those supporters (of Jayapal) to becoming more defiant and probably more supportive of political violence against Republicans,” he explained. “Whatever his intentions are, it is increasing the danger to Republicans.”
Sharlet said that, although the intention behind Jayapal’s words was easy to discern, “this is not the time for ambiguous language.” Politicians, he said, should aim to speak to the public in a more truthful and concise manner.
“They need to know the way it boomerangs back in a negative way to their own community,” Pape said, adding that he’d advise them to be more like Kirk’s widow, Erika.
At the memorial service for her husband, she said she forgives the man who killed her husband, adding that “the answer to hate is not hate.”
“Erika Kirk offered an olive branch here, and we need more olive branches here,” Pape said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)States don’t have to help enforce the Trump administration’s immigration policies in order to get disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled Wednesday.
Senior U.S. District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted a motion for a permanent injunction against the Department of Homeland Security, calling a federal directive issued in April “coercive, ambiguous, unrelated to the purpose of the federal grants, and undermine[s] the system of federalism.”
The directive made enforcing the administration’s immigration detention policies a condition for receiving federal disaster relief aid.
“States rely on these grants for billions of dollars annually in disaster relief,” wrote Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. “Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed.”
A group of Democratic attorneys general from 20 states filed suit against the Department of Homeland Security in May, claiming the agency lacked the legal authority to require states to abide by immigration policy in order to receive funding. The District of Columbia later joined the suit.
They argued in their initial lawsuit that not only was the policy unconstitutional, but violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Like all Democratic lawsuits, the attorneys general called the decision “arbitrary and capricious.”
Maryland joins suits against Trump administration over crime victim grants, clean energy caps

The Department of Homeland Security disagreed, arguing that conditions align with its core mission of enforcing federal immigration law.
But that was not enough of a justification for Smith.
“Such platitudes cannot substitute for an actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” he wrote.
Smith’s ruling was welcomed by Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who said tying aid to immigration policy exceeded the Department of Homeland Security’s authority and threatened to deny states the aid the needed and were due to receive under the law.
“This ruling not only preserves tens of millions of dollars in federal funding that helps Marylanders and their communities recover from devastating natural disasters – it also stops Maryland from having to break its own laws to acquire these essential resources,” Brown said in a prepared statement.
“Maryland fully complies with federal immigration law, but the Trump administration’s coercive conditions exceeded federal requirements and would have forced Maryland to violate its own laws that regulate state and local cooperation with immigration authorities,” he said.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha called Smith’s ruling a “win for the rule of law” and reaffirmed that President Donald Trump cannot pick and choose what federal laws to follow.
“Today’s permanent injunction by Judge Smith says, in no uncertain terms, that this Administration may not illegally impose immigration conditions on congressionally allocated federal funding for emergency services like disaster relief and flood mitigation,” Neronha said in a statement. “Case closed.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Besides Maryland, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.

Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday evening announced that they have reached a budget deal just days before the end of the current fiscal year, by proxy avoiding a government shutdown and raising sorely needed money for roads.
The details of the deal are still scarce, but it would include passage of a school aid budget and the state budget on time despite months of uncertainty and political jousting between the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, while Whitmer, for the most part, sat on the sidelines until it became apparent that she needed to step in and push things along.
That said, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said Thursday that the agreement was to a framework and a foundation to move things forward, with the various appropriations subcommittee chairs expected to work Friday and Monday to dig deeper into the numbers and pass the respective budget pieces before Tuesday, Sept. 30, the final day of the current fiscal year. 
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) speaks to reporters after tentative budget deal is announced. Sept. 25, 2025 | Screenshot
What is known is that the deal includes a long-term road funding deal and melds the top priorities of Democrats and Republicans alike. The Republicans get to do a victory lap because their calls for eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” and increasing government efficiency would be a part of the final plan. Democrats, on the other hand, get to keep the budget pieces that they have said will help average Michiganders thrive, which might include free school meals – but that has yet to be seen.
Whitmer, for her part, gets to take potentially the biggest victory lap of all, with her finally getting a divided government Legislature agreeing to nearly $2 billion per year to fix local roads. Hall, following House session on Thursday, said that was closer to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, but that’s still a start considering Whitmer had to have the state authorize bonds to fix roads during her tenure in the face of past Republican opposition.
“Today’s agreement in the legislature puts us on a path to lower costs, fix the damn roads, and pass a balanced, bipartisan budget by October 1,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I am grateful to Majority Leader Brinks, Speaker Hall, and legislators on both sides of the aisle for working hard to move this budget forward. In Michigan, we’ve proven again and again that we can work together to get things done by staying focused on the kitchen-table issues that make a real difference in people’s lives.”
Michigan House GOP facing pressure over ‘ghost employees’, but leadership says it’s a real problem

Whitmer also touched on the burgeoning uncertainty over the national economy under President Donald Trump, saying she was “proud that we are taking action to lower costs, cut taxes for seniors and working families, create jobs, fund schools, fix roads, keep people safe and healthy, and so much more.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said the people of Michigan deserve a budget that makes their lives better, one that boosts education, improves roads and protects health care in the state.
“The framework we have agreed to reflects the priorities of Michiganders from every region, and while no budget will be a perfect product, I am confident that the final result we vote on next week will have features that benefit every resident,” Brinks said in a statement.
Hall also said the framework offers an opportunity to reform “Michigan’s broken process and get much better value for the taxpayers.”
“There is still work to be done, but it is an important step that all of us are agreeing to implement meaningful tax relief for Michigan workers and seniors, bring transparency and accountability to the earmark process for the first time, and eliminate ghost employees,” Hall said. “Government has grown far too much in recent years, and we need to trim the waste, fraud and abuse in Lansing. That’s how we can afford the real priorities of Michigan families – like education, public safety, and fixing our local roads and bridges. This agreement puts us in position to do just that.” 
This is a developing story and will be updated later.

West was executed Thursday despite a clemency campaign by her son Will. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The state of Alabama executed Geoffrey Todd West, 50, on Thursday for the 1997 murder of Margaret Parrish Berry.
Thursday’s execution, carried out despite a public campaign from Berry’s son to stop it, marks the fourth time that the state put someone to death for the year, and third time in 2025 that Alabama used nitrogen gas as the method of execution.
Prior to his execution, West was given the opportunity to make a final statement but he declined. His attorney released a prepared statement to the media after he was put to death.
“I am sorry,” West said in his statement. “I have apologized privately to the family of Margaret Parrish Berry, and am humbled by the forgiveness her son, Will, has extended. I was baptized into the Catholic Church earlier this year and confirmed yesterday. I am at peace because I know where I am going and look forward to seeing Mrs. Berry when I get there. I urge everyone, especially young people, to find God. Spend a few moments to consider the two possibilities: this was all a fluke or there is a creator and a reason for everything. Your choice will determine where you spend eternity. God bless you all.”
Media who witnessed the execution said that staff for the Alabama Department of Corrections adjusted the mask shortly before the start of the execution. His spiritual adviser then walked over to West and prayed. West responded with a thumbs up sign.
After the execution began, West’s lips turned slightly pale and shook his head a couple of times and clenched his fists. His eyes also rolled to the back of his head and he began to salivate. West took several deep breaths followed by more shallow breaths. Witnesses also heard him gasping for breath before there was no more movement.
West was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m.
Berry’s son, Will, opposed the execution and said he wanted to meet in person with West. He urged Gov. Kay Ivey to exercise her authority and halt the execution. Ivey refused in a Sept. 11 letter, citing security concerns in denying a meeting with West.
“Alabama law imposes death as punishment for the most egregious forms of murder, and there was no question of Mr. West’s guilt by the jury in this case or any court over the last three decades,” Ivey said in a statement Thursday evening. “As I expressed in a letter to one of Ms. Berry’s sons, it is my solemn duty as governor to carry out these laws. Tonight, the lawfully imposed death sentence has been carried out, justice has been served, and I pray for healing for all.”
In a statement following the execution, Will Berry expressed condolences to West’s family.
“From what we understand, he acted out of character that night,” the statement said. “People he grew up with said he was a good person who got off track. We pray that he gains peace when he meets his maker.”
A jury convicted West of capital murder in 1999. According to court documents, West and his girlfriend entered a convenience store in March 1997 in Etowah County to rob the establishment. Berry was working when West entered the store with a firearm and killed Berry. He stole $250 from the store.
“I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God,” Will Berry wrote in a commentary. “I don’t want anyone to exact revenge in my name, nor in my mother’s. I believe life without the possibility of parole is just punishment. I believe there is an ending to this story where Mr. West and I find comfort in each other and in the healing power of forgiveness.”
The state executed Demetrius Frazier in February; James Osgood in April and Gregory Hunt in June. Frazier and Hunt were put to death by nitrogen gas; Osgood was executed by lethal injection.
Ivey has set the execution for Anthony Boyd in October. Another individual, David Lee Roberts, was supposed to be executed in August, but Marion County Circuit Lee Carter delayed the execution pending a mental health examination to determine if he is mentally competent to be put to death.
West did not file any recent appeals in court seeking to halt his execution.
“Our office has represented Mr. West for many years, and in that time we came to know a man who, despite his grave mistakes, came to understand the magnitude of his actions and the pain he caused,” his attorneys said in a statement. “He sought forgiveness, both privately and publicly. His remorse was sincere.”
They also said they were disappointed that Will Berry and West could not meet.
“We also share in the profound disappointment that the State of Alabama denied the victim’s son the opportunity to meet with Mr. West,” his attorneys said. “That meeting could have allowed Mr. West to apologize in person, and might have given the victim’s son a chance to hear that apology, perhaps to offer forgiveness. Denying this meeting was a lost opportunity—for closure, for healing, for humanity. It is a loss to all of us.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gregory-West-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-25 20:57:49.805090

(Photo by A.R.Nanouk/U.S. Fish and WIldlife Service)Everyone had a job. The men and boys drove the boats upriver to dip the nets in the river and seine. The women waited. Never wondering. There were always enough. The salmon that filled the boats when they returned weren’t huge — humpies aren’t — maybe a foot long. But they were plentiful and made for good drying.
My cousins and I played in the water. Swimming. Doing somersaults or handstands, holding our breath, eyes closed tight, our hands squishing in the mud on the slough side of the sandbar island our family called Eaton Station, in the Unalakleet River. Eaton Station: The best resort. We played badminton in the sand. Tanned on hand-sewn calico blankets laid on the beach. We ate Norton Sound red king crab, fatty grilled king salmon, and, if we were lucky, akutaq made by Mom or an auntie.  It seemed like the sun was always shining. And it probably was. Climate change wasn’t a part of our daily vocabulary, and persistent summer rains and winds weren’t a thing back then. July was for sun and salmon.
Once the boats returned, slow and heavy, the women gathered at the fish-cutting tables. My favorite part. They said funny things when they were working. They always knew the answer to everything. They always seemed to be smiling and laughing. The cumulus clouds above us, like whipped cream on grandma’s white cake with a sprinkle of fresh tart blueberries, laughed with them. My belly, my cheeks, my jaw, the oil and juice making up my eyeballs relaxed. Safe. So safe.
Life flowed easy.
My first job at the cutting table, when I was maybe 7 or 8, was to clean the slime and blood off the fish my aunties and Mom cut for drying. Three fish in each hand, I’d wade out on the river side of the island, the sun so hot it didn’t matter that the water was cold. I’d go past my knees, far enough to ensure that the fillets, attached by the tail, wouldn’t touch the river bottom and stayed free of any sand. I swished the orange flesh in the sparkling, fresh, clear water. The gulls, those greedy cousins, flying and squawking for any piece of flesh or eggs. Or milt — now and then I’d toss a piece of the white sac from a male, just to see it disappear whole, the gull’s head tilted to the sky.










Once the boats returned, slow and heavy, the women gathered at the fish-cutting tables. My favorite part.


One day, Mom handed me her ulu at the fish-cutting table. It was a graduation. A commencement. I was on to bigger things, the handover said. I was ready to learn the real craft. With real technique. With her favorite tool. I didn’t realize that from that point on, I’d stand at the table with Mom and my aunties and learn the secrets of the world when the boats came back.
With guidance from Mom, I cut my first humpie, a small female. I sliced down the belly, pushing harder than I anticipated. Then down the back. A few other cuts, and the fillets were attached at the tail, ready for the tirraqs, or angled slices, that ensure bite-sized bits in winter. When I was done, the heart was still attached. The purple morsel hung from the collar at the bottom of the fillet. I didn’t know that leaving the heart attached to dry was considered a skill. I hadn’t meant for that to happen.

“Wow, Paniuq!” Papa Ralph said, his voice ebullient, like cold Tang. “The heart still on there! The best way!”
Papa handed me my diploma with those words. Words warmed by the love and pride in his inflection, feelings that also flowed from his eyes and heart that day at Eaton Station. Words I can return to any time, to feel grounded in love. I am important, he said to me. I will do important work, he said to me. I am doing good, he said to me.
The pride seeped through my marrow. I waded out into the clean water of the river and swished the humpie, the cottonwoods and birches on the other side of the river practically clapping for me. I hung the cut fish on the drying rack made of cottonwood poles that my dad, brother and uncles put up every year.










I am important, he said to me. I will do important work, he said to me. I am doing good, he said to me


We no doubt ate uuraq that night for supper. Boiled pink salmon steaks and fish eggs with onions, potatoes, salt and pepper in a broth like no other. Mom would have put either kimchi or ketchup in hers. Dad, seal oil. If there was leftover uuraq in Mom’s stainless steel pot, blackened on the bottom from the fire, she tossed it into the river. White fish and grayling ate the pink meat and boiled eggs. We washed out our bowls at the river, using sand as dish soap for scrubbing.
My job of cutting fish returns, year after year. My favorite job. My favorite job because, thanks to my teachers, it is done with love and was born from love. Because we all work together, and together is the cornerstone of everything that gives meaning in life.  My favorite job because cutting fish means I belong. To a family, to a community that shares, and in the process of doing, I remember I belong to a long line of ancestors who made cuts just like the ones my mom showed me. It’s more than just food for the winter. Salmon remind me that I am important and loved.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Senate President Pro-tem Phil Berger acknowledged on social media Thursday that he would be open to North Carolina redrawing congressional district maps this year if necessary.
In August, President Donald Trump asked Texas to redraw the state’s congressional district to help Republicans win five additional seats in the U.S. House. When Texas agreed to the maneuver, California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded with a pledge to redraw his own state’s maps, creating additional seats for congressional Democrats. Newsom is also seeking a special election that would allow California to bypass its independent redistricting commission and enact a new map.
With Texas and California in play for 2026, multiple other states have indicated they may also redraw their maps, rather than wait for the next redistricting cycle, typically at the start of each decade.
Berger said he’s been closely watching what’s going on in California, accusing Democrats of trying to steal the narrow Republican-majority in Congress.
“We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats because of their sue-until-blue strategy,” Berger wrote on X. “If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.”
Berger denied speaking to Trump about the possibility of redrawing North Carolina’s congressional map or seeking an endorsement. Berger is locked in a tight primary challenge against Sam Page, the longtime Rockingham County sheriff.
Berger said an unsubstantiated rumor that he might redraw the first congressional district seat currently held by Rep. Don Davis (NC-01) to favor a Republican was blatantly false.
“The Democrats are spreading lies to hurt President Trump,” Berger wrote.
U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02) said if the reports of new redistricting plans in the North Carolina General Assembly are true, Republicans have stooped to a new low.
“From Texas to Missouri and now North Carolina, Republicans are waging a war on American voting rights because they know the truth – their policies are unpopular, their candidates are unlikable, and they can’t win a majority in Congress without stacking the deck in their favor,” said Ross in a statement.
It is not unusual for the president’s party to lose seats in a mid-term election. Redrawing the maps would be a way of limiting losses for Trump, and perhaps keeping control of the Congress.
“We will fight these corrupt redistricting plans in every single state,” Ross wrote. “We will fight for our democracy and for American voters who are tired of corrupt leaders silencing their voices.”
North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton said news reports of further gerrymandering by the Senate leader amounted to a ‘slimy backroom deal.’
“Berger is once again doing what he’s always done: changing the rules, sabotaging the will of the people, and holding critical priorities like Medicaid hostage in a desperate attempt to cling to power,” Clayton said in a statement released by the party.
Berger campaigned in Concord Wednesday with Vice President JD Vance, two days after passing Iryna’s Law, an expansive crime bill that creates a new path to resume the death penalty.
North Carolina’s current congressional delegation in the U.S. House consists of 10 Republicans and four Democrats. The first congressional district is the state’s only competitive House seat.
The 2024 contest between incumbent Democrat Don Davis and Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout was North Carolina’s most expensive congressional race with the two raising more than $10 million.
The Cook Political Report lists Davis as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country.
This is a developing story.

Josh Stein speaks about pending medicaid cuts as Chelsea Grey left, Dr. Jenner Beckham, middle, and Pete Tannebaum look on (Photo by Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein on Thursday urged lawmakers to prevent looming cuts to the state’s Medicaid program, warning the reductions could hurt residents and cripple already struggling hospitals and clinics.
Speaking at Alliance Medical Ministry in Raleigh, Stein said the state faces a $319 million shortfall, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and clinics set to drop Oct. 1. If the cuts take effect, he said, patients could face longer wait times, delayed diagnoses and reduced access to essential treatments.
“The General Assembly has failed you, but it is not too late for them to step up and do the right thing,” Stein said. “Let’s work together again. Let’s put our people’s health first. Let’s get it done. I am ready to sign a clean Medicaid funding bill today.”
Stein pointed to a $500 million Medicaid contingency reserve that lawmakers could tap to prevent the reductions. He said that the cuts are reversible if legislators act immediately rather than waiting until they return to Raleigh on Oct. 20.
“I’m using every tool at my disposal to ask for the money, to look for the money, to demand the money that we need to keep our state’s health care system safe, money like the $500 million that is in the Medicaid contingency reserve account that is available for the legislature to appropriate today”
The Senate and House passed their respective Medicaid funding bills this week, but they remain at odds. Senate leaders want to include money for a new children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals, while House Republicans are pushing for a “clean bill” without the extra money.
Unless lawmakers act soon, the state health department says it has no choice but to move forward with the cuts.
House Speaker Destin Hall has said the state already budgeted enough to keep Medicaid running into next year and accused Stein of manufacturing a “fake crisis” for political gain. 
Stein rejected suggestions to simply delay the cuts, saying another extension would only compound the problem. The state already postponed the reductions by three months, he noted, and further delay would leave lawmakers scrambling to close the $319 million gap in less time. 
“By identifying cuts that are reversible, they can solve this problem at any point,” Stein said. Waiting, he warned, would increase financial pressure and could force even deeper reductions later. “I had hoped that the legislature would realize that helping people get the health care they need is more important than grinding their political axes.”
Other speakers talked about the potential impact of the cuts on doctors, hospitals and clinics, warning that reduced Medicaid funding could force providers to scale back services or stop accepting patients altogether.
Chelsea Grey, a mother of three, described caring for her daughter, who suffers seizures each day and depends on Medicaid for treatment. “Every day is already uncertain,” said Grey, who is also a disability advocate. “We are barely staying afloat with the funds that Medicaid currently has.”
Pete Tannenbaum, executive director of Alliance Medical Ministry, noted the broader economic ripple effects. Free clinics like his, he said, saved hospitals $350 million last year by diverting patients from emergency rooms. “This is not just a financial crisis,” Tannenbaum said. “It’s a human crisis.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1987-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 20:57:49.805090
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-25 23:56:27+00:00,Mississippi Today,School choice opponents warn lawmakers of segregation and financial collapse as advocates tout ‘education freedom’,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/25/school-choice-opponent-segregation/,Lawmakers selected to study school choice proposals in Mississippi made good Thursday on their promise to hear from both sides of the debate. What resulted was a dizzying day of conflicting arguments.,"Lawmakers selected to study school choice proposals in Mississippi made good Thursday on their promise to hear from both sides of the debate. 
What resulted was a dizzying day of conflicting arguments, punctuated by a lunch break that divided the differences in opinion.
In the morning, a school superintendent from the Gulf Coast and an education policy expert argued against expanding such programs in Mississippi, citing education’s worth as a public good. 
But the afternoon speakers — a school choice advocate from Florida and an education researcher — instead referred to the education system as a business and centered their argument around the superiority of private schools. 
It was the second meeting of the House Education Freedom select committee, which was created by Republican House Speaker Jason White to weigh pros and cons of a robust school choice program. So far, neither of the select committee’s meetings has been streamed online. 
“Education freedom,” the moniker that Republicans prefer to describe school choice ideas, refers to a myriad of policies that either disburse money to families to pay for education services, including private school tuition, or allow families to move their children to different schools, regardless of type or location. The issue has gained traction under the Trump administration, and White and other state leaders have repeatedly indicated their support for the issue, which is expected to headline the legislative session that starts in January. 
Kim Wiley, education policy analyst at the Mississippi Center for Justice, kicked off the meeting with a warning. 
Over the course of an hour, she reminded legislators of the academic gains that have landed the state in a national spotlight and cautioned against turning the “Mississippi Miracle” into a “Mississippi Mistake.”
Around 55,000 students in Mississippi attend private schools, while another 22,000 are homeschooled, she said. One of the options state leaders are exploring — education savings accounts or ESAs — would award families vouchers in the amount of their state-funded student allocation to spend on their education however they see fit. Wiley said it could potentially bankrupt the state, costing upward of $500 million. 
In other states, voucher programs have been grossly underestimated. Wiley used Arizona as an example, which is common among school choice opponents. The state expanded the program quickly and without many guardrails, resulting in huge, unexpected costs. Wiley said if something similar is passed in Mississippi, it would come at the detriment of funding to other important issues such as public safety, health care and rural schools. 
With federal pandemic relief funding ending and the elimination of the state income tax, Wiley said expanding school choice is a brewing “fiscal storm.” 
She offered recommendations that — if school choice were to be expanded — she said would “lessen the harmful impact,” including establishing income limits for eligibility and requiring that voucher applicants have previously attended a public school. 
Wiley was grilled by Republican representatives who asked her for examples of neighboring states where expanding school choice was “disastrous,” as she put it. While it’s true that Mississippi is surrounded by states with  some version of universal school choice, many of those programs are in their first year, so it’s hard to say what the effects have been. 
Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville who co-chairs the select committee, told Wiley, “We’re not doing what Arizona did. Let’s get that out of the way.”
Rep. Gregory Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst, asked Wiley who was behind the recent school choice push.

“Defunding public schools has become a priority for some,” she responded. “I think that there are those private interests who realize this is a cash cow. This is a way that they can sort of game the system.” 
Owen said later Thursday that he was disturbed by her assertion. 
Biloxi School District Superintendent Marcus Boudreaux followed Wiley with a passionate argument against expanding school choice and one that firmly centered schools as the bedrock of communities. 
His presentation against expanding school choice policies ran the gamut, arguing they would worsen the teacher shortage and lead to school closures.  
He said there was no demand for the policy in his community, where the public district is consistently top-rated. Boudreaux said expanding school choice would create two separate publicly-funded education systems, one without the same level of accountability as the other. 
Boudreaux suggested he was supportive of an open enrollment program that would allow students to transfer between public school districts. But he acknowledged that letting students leave schools where they live would worsen the financial and academic disparities between districts, creating “have” districts and “have nots” as money follows students.

“I honestly see it as a return to segregation,” he said. “Not necessarily racial segregation — economic segregation.”
When Rep. Trey Lamar, a powerful Republican lawmaker from Senatobia, asked Boudreaux what he would say to children in Greenwood who have limited options outside of their struggling school district, unlike in Biloxi, Boudreaux’s response was succinct.
“I don’t say it to the children,” he said. “I say it to their state. It’s time to invest in public education everywhere.” 
Boudreaux said earlier in his presentation: “All Mississippi children deserve the best.”
After a lunch break, legislators heard from Erika Donalds, a school choice activist and wife of Florida gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds.
She described her sons’ different experiences in public school, which eventually led her to enrolling one in a private school despite struggling to pay his tuition. Donalds later helped found a network of charter schools and campaigned her way onto the local school board, which is where she realized the public school system wasn’t responsive to parents, she said. 
Interrupted by frequent applause from supporters, Donalds described classrooms where students were spending the majority of their days being taught by teachers whose values didn’t align with those of the students’ families. She cited polls from pro-school choice organizations that showed parental support for the policy, and added that education was the only “industry” that allowed monopolies in the form of the public school system.  
Donalds also had a warning for lawmakers: If school choice isn’t expanded, companies boasting innovative education programs and technologies would be less inclined to come to Mississippi. 
“Put these decisions in the hands of parents,” she said. “Give them the education freedom that they deserve, and watch the economy of education in Mississippi flourish.”

House Education Committee Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, asked Donalds if expanding school choice would harm school districts — a fear of parents who have reached out to him. She responded that high-performing, wealthy districts tend to “beef up,” while less-resourced districts are the ones that are hurt.
Responding to Wiley’s earlier claim, Donalds said she didn’t know anyone — charter school founders, private school leaders or advocacy group staffers — that was “in it for the money.”
“Running schools is a difficult way to do that,” Donalds said, despite describing herself as an “education entrepreneur.” It was reported this summer by a news outlet, the Florida Bulldog, that Donalds’ education companies have garnered millions in charter school contracts. 
Donalds emphasized to leaders that their decision to expand school choice would be supported by President Donald Trump, echoing a sentiment repeatedly shared by federal education leaders at the first Education Freedom select committee meeting in August. 
Thursday’s meeting concluded with Patrick Wolf, a researcher who serves as the Endowed Chair in School Choice in the University of Arkansas Department of Education Reform. He presented a litany of studies — many authored himself — that connected enrollment in school choice programs with higher rates of high school and college diplomas.

Prosecutors had sought an additional charge of making false statements, but the grand jury returned only one.“No one is above the law,” Bondi wrote. “Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.”FBI Director Kash Patel on social media referenced the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won. Comey was FBI director at the outset of that investigation.“Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability,” Patel wrote. “For far too long, previous corrupt leadership and their enablers weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and severely eroding public trust. …Nowhere was this politicization of law enforcement more blatant than during the Russiagate hoax, a disgraceful chapter in history we continue to investigate and expose.”‘We can’t delay any longer’The Senate confirmed Comey, 93-1, in 2013. He oversaw the agency’s probe of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election. Trump fired him after pressuring him to end the investigation and failing. Trump and Comey have publicly sparred since his dismissal. Comey has denied wrongdoing.Over the weekend, Trump posted on social media urging Bondi to take action against Comey and other political enemies, demanding retribution for his own prosecutions.“Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done,’” Trump wrote. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!! President DJT.”Trump was impeached twice during his first term and was indicted in four criminal proceedings following his first term.On Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the new interim top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey indictments were returned. Halligan, who was endorsed by Trump for the post, has represented Trump as his personal lawyer.Virginia U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said Halligan’s appointment — after the firing of Erik Siebert, the permanent U.S. attorney in the district, who declined to pursue charges against Comey — showed the prosecution was political.“I’ve had my differences with James Comey in the past, but I can spot trumped-up charges a mile away,” Kaine wrote in a statement. “Trump said he’d go after him, then fired a superb, ethical prosecutor when he refused to bring frivolous charges against those whom Trump perceived to be his enemies.”",,,,2025-09-25 19:58:22.055041

BURLINGTON — Melissa Davis, the widow of Gregory Davis, addressed for the first time the man who ordered her husband’s deadly hit and that man’s former friend who played a role in carrying it out.
Gregory Davis, of Danville, was killed more than seven years ago not far from his home after he was kidnapped and shot as part of a murder-for-hire plot.
“I stand here today not only as a widow, but as the mother of seven children whose lives were shattered the night Gregg was taken from us,” Melissa Davis said Thursday. She spoke during the sentencing hearing in Burlington’s federal court for Serhat Gumrukcu, the man convicted of commissioning her husband’s killing. 
Gumrukcu walked into the courtroom before the hearing, dressed in a red prison uniform. Sitting a few feet away from where Melissa Davis stood in the courtroom to address him, Gumrukcu did not appear to look at her or react to her words. In the roughly 30-minute hearing, he did not address her comments.
A jury convicted Gumrukcu in April of several charges, including murder for hire and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The jury reached the verdict following a five-week trial that featured him taking the stand in his own defense and the three co-defendants testifying against him.
Melissa Davis, her voice breaking with emotion, talked Thursday about the scar the death of her 49-year-old husband left on her and her children. She was pregnant with their seventh child when Gregg was killed, but despite the devastation, she said she decided to name the baby Jubilee. “I chose to believe God would one day bring beauty, restoration, and freedom,” she said, her words interrupted by sobs. 
Melissa Davis continued to describe how their oldest daughter just started college this summer and had decided to study forensic psychology and help combat crime. Their oldest son studies criminal justice and tries to fill the role of his father — a burden no boy should have, Davis said.
While Melissa Davis fought depression to be strong for her children, Gumrukcu lived a wealthy life built on lies and deception, she said. 
“You thought you could silence my husband, but your lies die here in this courtroom,” she told Gumrukcu. 
Gregg’s death protected future victims from Gumrukcu, and her late husband’s legacy will continue through his children, according to Melissa Davis.
Sheryl Davis, Gregg’s mother, also submitted a statement for the court. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig read it for her, as she said she couldn’t bear to be face-to-face with the men who killed her son. Gregg was her only child, Sheryl Davis wrote in the statement, and he left behind four boys and three girls who can no longer count on their father. She asked the court to sentence Gumrukcu to life in prison.
Later Thursday, Berk Eratay, Gumrukcu’s former friend, was sentenced for his role in the plot. He had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to launder money.
Melissa Davis addressed Eratay, too, saying that his choices contributed to her husband’s death but also acknowledging that she saw him change during the trial. When Eratay described the sorrow he felt over the loss of his father, who died while he was incarcerated, Melissa Davis said she felt a connection with him because she had endured that kind of pain, too. 
Yet, she found solace in faith and exhorted Eratay to do the same, noting that “the debt of taking a life cannot ever be repaid by human hands.” 
Eratay and Melissa Davis had exchanged letters before, but this time, Davis said, she could look him in the eye and tell him, “I forgive you.” Eratay wiped away tears as he lifted his head to look at her.

‘How do things get so far off track?’
The two sentencing hearings unfolded in different ways. 
In the first one, Judge Christina Reiss has said she has no leeway in the sentence she could impose since Gumrukcu’s convictions carry a mandatory sentence of life behind bars. 
However, the judge agreed Thursday to a request from Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, to delay the formal imposition of that sentence until November. Marcus told the judge she needed more time to consider possible challenges to information contained in a pre-sentence report prepared by a federal probation officer ahead of Thursday’s hearing. 
Reiss, in granting the delay, apologized to Davis’ family members in the courtroom but said it was important that Gumrukcu had the ability to present his position as well.
Gumrukcu, 42, was arrested in May 2022 in California, where he was living at the time. A Turkish national, Gumrukcu had come to the United States more than a decade earlier and worked as an entrepreneur and biomedical researcher. 
The prosecutors argued during the trial that greed motivated Gumrukcu to kill Gregory Davis, and he ordered and paid for the deadly hit. 
Gumrukcu, according to prosecutors, feared that Gregory Davis was going to report him to authorities and accuse him of fraud in a failed oil deal between the two men. Gumrukcu believed that the fraud allegation could jeopardize a larger biomedical deal he had been working on, where he eventually gained tens of millions of dollars, the prosecutors told the jury.
Prosecutors told jurors that Gumrukcu brought Eratay into the plot to help carry it out with two other men — Aron Lee Ethridge and Jerry Banks — later joining in. Banks was ultimately the one who traveled to Vermont and fatally shot Gregory Davis in January 2018.
Banks and Ethridge, who have also reached plea deals with prosecutors, are set to be sentenced Friday.
Allan Sullivan, Eratay’s attorney, argued Thursday for a five-year prison sentence for his client, half of what the prosecutor was seeking. The defense attorney cited, in large part, Eratay’s cooperation with the prosecutors and that he testified over several days in Gumrukcu’s trial. 
Reiss questioned Eratay during the hearing to better understand his motive. The judge said she read the 70 letters submitted by friends and relatives in his support and pointed out that they showed Eratay had always been loved and supported — unlike some of the other men involved in the murder for hire who had troubled pasts. 
Yet he still ended up involved in a murder plot. 
“How do things get so far off track?” she asked.
Eratay wasn’t fully able to answer that question, but his statements —  and those of prosecutors — suggested Gumrukcu’s charisma along with Eratay’s loyalty and eagerness to help his friend played a central role.
“It took him some time to realize how deeply involved he was,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Pau Van de Graaf said. In contrast with the other men involved, Eratay didn’t have a personal or financial motive, the prosecutor said. He believed he was only a middleman, Van de Graaf added, but after his father passed, he probably realized how involved he had been.
Eratay, 39, also spoke, apologizing to the Davis family members in the courtroom for his actions and telling the judge he believed he fell under the influence of Gumrukcu and acted out of loyalty to his friend.
“I hope today you will give me a second chance,” Eratay said to Reiss,  as his mother, who came from Turkey, and several friends sat in the court.
Reiss told Eratay she believed a five-year prison term for Eratay was too short given the seriousness of the offenses, but she didn’t impose the full 10 years the prosecution had requested. 
In imposing a sentence of 110 months, or just over nine years, Reiss told Eratay she wanted him to take to heart the words delivered in the courtroom moments earlier by Melissa Davis.
“I hope you know how lucky you are that she forgives you,” the judge told him.

“Idaho’s outdated and deteriorating infrastructure is to blame,” Ryan Langrill, director of the Office of Performance Evaluations, wrote in a letter summarizing the watchdog state agency’s latest report. 
A new system could fix that. But the report recommended the Idaho Legislature think about stabilizing funding as the state works to modernize Idaho’s emergency communications system by shifting to a secure, digital network called Next Generation 911.
State lawmakers serving on the Legislature’s Joint Legislative Oversight Committee — which orders reports from the state watchdog agency — on Thursday publicly released the report and heard its findings.
“A large-scale IT project is one of the highest risk activities that state government can undertake, as evidenced by (the Office of Performance Evaluation’s) reports on Luma, numerous education initiatives, and Medicaid payment processing,” Langrill wrote. “… Right now, no state-level entity has the authority and responsibility to manage statewide 911 initiatives. We believe the Legislature can set the state up for success by strengthening state-level authority and oversight.”

 Funding for Idaho’s next generation 911 system will run out by 2031

Without changes, funding for Idaho’s Next Generation 911 system will run out in six years, the report said.
Idaho approves $15M grant to upgrade emergency response system to Next Generation 911

The Office of Performance Evaluations recommended the Legislature “consider developing a funding mechanism for statewide emergency communications infrastructure.” 
That could be through raising taxes on phone lines by about 20 cents, or setting aside state funds, Casey Petti, a principal evaluator on the report, told state lawmakers. 
The recommendation comes as Idaho’s state government faces tough finances for this fiscal year and next fiscal year. 
Gov. Brad Little ordered all state agencies, besides public schools, to cut budgets by 3% mid-year amid dwindling state revenues — months after he and the Legislature passed $450 million in tax cuts. The governor’s budget chief recently told agencies those cuts would be permanent. 
As the meeting ended, Rep. Steve Berch, a Boise Democrat, urged lawmakers to think about the state’s needs before cutting the state’s revenue even more. 
“There isn’t a problem in this state that money can’t solve,” he said. “Especially a fast-growing state with an aging infrastructure. We’ve seen almost every (Office of Performance Evaluations) report ultimately points out that we need to make investments to solve the problems that are being presented to us. So, I hope we as legislators, as we prepare for the next session, we think about what the needs are before we start continuing cutting revenue.” 
 How the new system could help. And what else it recommended to get there. 

Many emergency calls in Idaho run through a copper-based network that “is aging, expensive to maintain, and vulnerable to outages,” according to the report. 
“Idaho’s emergency communications system is increasingly unable to meet modern demands,” the report said. “… We found that calls from wireless phones are not routed (to emergency officials) using the caller’s exact location, which can result in calls being sent to the wrong county or state, delaying emergency response.”
The next generation 911 system could fix that issue, the report said. Using an internet-based network, the new system can route calls to local emergency officials based on people’s locations.
The Legislature should consider taking several steps to help, the report recommended, including:

Changing state law “to evolve the Idaho Public Safety Communications Commission into a statewide entity with the authority to develop and oversee a statewide 911 system.”
Selecting an agency to be responsible for, and have authority over, collecting and managing data for a geographic information system, or GIS, statewide.
And “developing a funding mechanism for statewide emergency communications infrastructure.”

The state’s Public Safety Communications Commission should also work with emergency officials to “develop and publish a roadmap for the statewide transition,” the report added. 
The report recommended Idaho shift to collecting 911 fees at the state level, saying the Gem State was one of only three states that collects the fees locally.

In response to the report, the head of the commission’s parent agency, the Idaho Military Division, agreed with the recommendation to consolidate payment processes.
“This is an excellent and necessary step that would reduce administrative friction, enhance accountability, and significantly improve auditing capabilities across the system,” Idaho’s Adjutant General Timothy Donnellan wrote in a letter, shared with the report. 
But he wrote that the report’s estimate for potential fees to collect — called a remittance rate — seemed “overly optimistic when compared to national standards and Idaho’s specific demographic context.” 
In a separate letter in the report, Gov. Little wrote he agreed with that concern, and would tap the Idaho Military Division “to take the lead for my executive agencies in working closely with legislators to ensure a unified consensus and strategy are determined.”

Bill Mercer, R-Billings, speaks during a floor session of the House on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)Well, it’s not often we get to say this — in fact, it may be the first and last time — but thank you, President Donald J. Trump.
No, not for wrecking international alliances, raising our taxes through tariffs, starting an international trade war, and increasing the national deficit, but for something truly unexpected: Taking Bill Mercer out of Montana’s gubernatorial sweepstakes and plunking him onto the federal bench instead.
Seriously, thank you.
Bill Mercer was shaping up to be a real contender for governor. A Republican with actual brain cells, a résumé longer than a CVS receipt, and the uncanny ability to talk policy until even the policy wonks nod off. He’s been U.S. Attorney, a Department of Justice insider, and a prolific legislator (39 sponsored bills in 2025).
But now, thanks to Trump’s nomination, all that gubernatorial ambition is headed for early retirement — in a black robe. As we all know (especially from Republicans’ endless pontifications), judges don’t make laws, they just “call balls and strikes.” Which, in Mercer’s case, means he’ll be forced to sit quietly, restrain his policymaking itch, and actually follow precedent. Gasp.
Imagine the pain of having to respect Obergefell vs. Hodges (the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide), when you could have been leading a crusade to “restore family values” from the governor’s mansion, plotting an end to Medicaid expansion, and finding new ways to discriminate against the LGBTQ community.
This is what we call a “win-win.’
Now, to be fair, Mercer is smart.  He’s been called “the smartest guy in the room,” and I believe it. He graduated from the University of Montana and was named a Truman Scholar. He’s affable, well-spoken, and oozes respectability. He’s the kind of guy who can oppose Medicaid expansion in a city whose economy depends on healthcare and still convince half the room he’s doing it “for the good of the system.”
But alas, this judicial promotion means no more writing laws that ignore the working poor, and no more bills that undervalue public health. Instead, he’ll be spending his days reviewing briefs and issuing orders — and hopefully not freelancing new interpretations of the Constitution from the bench.
Of course, the Trump seal of approval should give everyone pause. Mercer’s nomination is described as a recognition of his “tremendous experience” and his commitment to “the Rule of Law” — which, in Trumpian translation, means: “He didn’t prosecute me.” But it’s worth noting that Mercer has actual integrity, which might prove to be a liability in the MAGA universe. Stay tuned to see if Trump withdraws his nomination after discovering Mercer won’t overturn birthright citizenship from the bench by waving a gavel like a magic wand.
And what a relief for Montana politics! With Mercer benched, that leaves Attorney General Austin Knudsen as the GOP’s frontrunner for governor — a man so ethically compromised he could teach a masterclass in how not to behave as a lawyer. The Montana Commission on Practice unanimously recommended suspending Knudsen’s law license for 90 days for 41 separate instances of “unprecedented misconduct” that violated multiple ethical rules. Expect law professors across the nation to update their ethics syllabi under the new chapter heading: “The Knudsen Exception: When Law School Wasn’t Enough.”
So again — thank you, Mr. Trump. You did what Montana voters may not have been able to: You sidelined Bill Mercer. You spared us a political race where Mercer’s affability and intelligence might have masked his extraordinary record of bad policy choices. You saved us from another Republican governor who believes “limited government” means fewer rights for everyone but corporations.
Now, instead of signing bills, Mercer will be signing orders – primarily in criminal cases. Instead of crafting policy, he’ll be citing precedent. And instead of governing, he’ll be judging — hopefully with the integrity and restraint we were always told judges should have. Because if there’s one thing Republicans always say judges should do, it’s nothing creative.
And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, Mercer will surprise Trump World from the bench. Because for all our political differences, Mercer is, at his core, a man of integrity. He will discharge the duties of his office with honor, independence, and fidelity to the Constitution — values that are utterly anathema to Donald Trump. If Mercer stays true to his values and oath, he just might become the best kind of Trump appointee: The kind who ends up disappointing Trump.
Thanks again, Don.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3459-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 19:58:22.055041

The Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia filed motions Monday to quash subpoenas served on the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in June.
They’re among more than 20 doctors and clinics across the country that provided transgender health care that have received demands for sensitive medical records and personal information from the DOJ. The filings by the law center were made on behalf of four patients of UPMC and five CHOP patients and their families.
Public Interest Law Center Legal Director Mimi McKenzie said the Trump administration’s description of gender-affirming care as “mutilation” and child abuse has created fear for many families with transgender children.
“Parents and patients are extremely worried about having their identities disclosed to the Department of Justice and the broader world in this political and social climate,” McKenzie said.
In its filings, the law center notes that a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a motion by Boston Children’s Hospital to quash an identical subpoena earlier this month. U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun found the subpoena was issued improperly to interfere with the right to gender-affirming care in Massachusetts.
Gov. Josh Shapiro has joined a federal lawsuit led by Massachusetts and more than a dozen other Democrat-led states challenging President Donald Trump’s executive orders and regulations that “unlawfully targeted transgender individuals.”
The CHOP and UPMC patients note in their filings that gender affirming care remains legal in Pennsylvania, although the Human Rights Campaign reports 27 states have banned such medical treatment. While U.S. medical associations generally support gender-affirming care, some European countries take a more cautious approach, prioritizing psychological support and restricting some treatments for minors. 
The subpoenas request billing records, consent forms, information on the use of puberty blockers and hormones, use of billing codes in connection with gender affirming care, reports of adverse events, doctors’ notes and recordings and patient identifying information for minors who received gender affirming care, including social security numbers and home addresses. 
They followed a memo from Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate directing the DOJ’s civil division to prioritize investigations in furtherance of Trump’s Inauguration Day executive orders reversing federal policy recognizing transgender people and health care.
The order directed Attorney General Pam Bondi, among other things, to investigate “deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public,” about the long-term side effects of gender-affirming care, which the order describes as “chemical and surgical mutilation.”
McKenzie said the DOJ’s stated intent is to investigate providers for potential violations of federal law regarding off-label uses of hormones and puberty blockers. The department is also investigating whether providers violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims to federal health care programs for “non-covered services related to radical gender experimentation.”
“What is happening here is the Trump administration is weaponizing the DOJ to threaten providers and intimidate families all in an effort to end this very important care for transgender youth,” McKenzie said.
CHOP still provides gender affirming care through its Gender and Sexuality Development Program. UPMC, however, has ceased some gender-affirming care due to the Trump administration’s memos, directives and subpoenas.
“These actions have made it abundantly clear that our clinicians can no longer provide certain types of gender-affirming care without risk of criminal prosecution. This includes specific restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for individuals under the age of 19,” a UPMC spokesperson said in a statement.
The hospital continues to provide essential behavioral health support and other care “within the bounds of the law” while maintaining physician-patient confidentiality.
“We empathize deeply with the patients and families affected by these ongoing changes,” the statement says.
CHOP did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for comment Thursday. The hospital has been fighting the subpoena since July, accusing the DOJ of targeting “patients who have struggled with deeply personal issues concerning gender, and who have been victims of harassment and discrimination.”
A DOJ spokesperson said in a statement that Bondi and the DOJ will use every legal and law enforcement tool available to protect innocent children, referring to gender-affirming care as “mutilation.”
McKenzie said the records targeted in the subpoena are the most sensitive that any person could have and are protected by a constitutional right to privacy. They include information about the patients’ mental health, reproductive health and sexual health. To invade that privacy, the government must have a compelling reason, which the law center argues it does not have.
“If the Constitution means anything, it means the federal government can’t rifle through your child’s medical records in order to intimidate you,” McKenzie said.
The law center’s filings on the families’ behalf also argue the DOJ requests are “hugely broad” (as the Massachusetts judge also noted) and represents “a barely disguised political agenda in search of a health care fraud offense” – all without stating a compelling reason to compromise patient privacy.
The court doesn’t need to read the subtext, “because animus is official policy,” the law center argues.
“The administration has asserted that transgender citizens cannot lead an ‘honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle,’ and that their medical treatment is part of a ‘warped ideology’ and ‘evil and backwards lies’ that cause ‘sexual mutilation,’” the filings say.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 19:58:22.055041

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers are planning for a special session in late January or early February to make decisions on how the state will spend up to $500 million in federal Rural Health Transformation funds.
It’s unclear whether Gov. Kelly Armstrong would call the special session or if lawmakers would use their remaining legislative days to gather at the Capitol. 
The Legislature can meet for up to 80 days every two years. Lawmakers have six days left after adjourning the regular session in May. If the Legislative Management Committee calls a special session, that time limit would apply.
If the governor calls a special session, it would not count against the Legislature’s 80-day limit.
Armstrong said in a statement Thursday his office is working with legislative leaders to determine the best path forward.
“We thank them and are excited to work with them as we prepare our proposal,” Armstrong said.
If Armstrong calls lawmakers to Bismarck, the governor would set the scope of the special session in a report to the Legislature once members convene, but lawmakers would be free to conduct the session as they see fit, said Mike Nowatzki, spokesperson for Armstrong’s office.
“I think it would be great if the governor called it,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, a member of Legislative Management. “I don’t think the Legislature wants to use up any of our days when we think this is more critical for him to be calling the shot on this one.”
Other lawmaker proposals could be considered during a special session, Klein said, but Legislative Management would vet those proposals ahead of time and only allow what was “absolutely necessary” to be presented to the assembly.
North Dakota legislative leaders expect special session for federal rural health care dollars

“If there are other critical needs, if there are other critical areas of what we need to fund or fix, which we may have missed, we’re going to take a look at that,” Klein said.
The additional rural health funds lawmakers are poised to discuss were included in the 10-year budget reconciliation law.
North Dakota is expected to receive at least $100 million each year from the program, Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers this week. The state could qualify for more funding depending on its application, she said.
The department must apply for the funds by Nov. 5. The money can be used for behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development, disease prevention and chronic disease, and other areas described in the bill. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services has scheduled virtual listening sessions starting Oct. 3 to get feedback from the public about priorities.
Lawmakers on Thursday established a new 33-member Rural Health Transformation Committee so they can weigh in on the state’s application for the funding. The committee consists of members of each chamber’s Human Services Committee and those who serve on the Human Relations Division of appropriations committees.
The committee will meet Oct. 14-15 to receive presentations from the Department of Health and Human Services and get input from the listening sessions, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, who is the committee chair. An additional meeting may be held Oct. 21, if needed.
The dollars are expected to be awarded to states by the end of the year.
The Legislature would then hold the special session to make decisions on how those federal dollars are distributed in the state.
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum called two special sessions during his term. In October 2023, lawmakers met for three days after the North Dakota Supreme Court invalidated the Office of Management and Budget bill. The Legislature met for five days in 2021 to discuss legislative redistricting and federal coronavirus relief funds.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)A new state analysis of New Mexico roads found that they had deteriorated to the lowest ratings in “recent history,” and state analysts are raising concerns about how a key state fund will generate enough revenue to address the issue. 
According to the 2024 annual road condition survey from the New Mexico Department of Transportation, 84% of interstate highway miles are in “fair or better” condition, down from 90% in 2023. Non-interstate roads deteriorated much faster, according to the DOT, with 70% rated in “fair or better” condition, down from 86% in 2023. 
That’s the lowest since at least 2020, according to a DOT database, when 88% of interstate roads met the “fair or better” standard, and 78% of non-interstate roads did.
Lawmakers with the Legislative Finance Committee expressed alarm at the problem during a hearing Thursday morning in Hobbs, at which an LFC analyst, along with NM Transportation Secretary Ricky Serna, presented. 
“Really my heart sank when I read the first sentence in the staff report,” said Rep. Cathrynn Brown (R-Carlsbad), of the LFC’s report that opened with a discussion of the poor road conditions. “We’ve got to do better.”
By the #s: New Mexico targets its pedestrian death rate — the highest in the U.S.

According to the LFC report, revenue toward the State Road Fund is expected to slow over the next few fiscal years. Factors contributing to that are the stagnation of gasoline tax and license fees, possibly due to the rise of electric vehicles, as well as a predicted slowdown in state general fund growth, according to the report. 
But Serna argued that the way the DOT is funded plays more of a role in the department’s financial challenges than electric vehicles. He noted that unfunded mandates for state workers, like pay increases or retirement contribution changes, come out of the State Road Fund. 
“So more than half of the State Road Fund is used just to pay for salaries, and the remainder of that is what is primarily used for maintenance activities across the state,” he said. 
The LFC says the road deterioration is occurring despite the department meeting its performance targets on pavement preservation. For example, the DOT in fiscal year 2024 preserved more than 5,000 miles of pavement, when its target was 3,500.
“Given the recently reported deterioration, the current target of 3,500 may be insufficient to maintain road quality,” according to the report.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2784-e1758841965992-1024x819.png,,,2025-09-25 19:58:22.055041

Intralot, a Greek-based sports betting and technology company, won the bid, but that process wasn’t always so certain. During the 2025 Legislature, lawmakers, including Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, raced to close a loophole that would have allowed the state’s lottery commission to circumvent the bidding process, and simply name a vendor.
The Legislature stymied the plans, and forced the commission to go out to bid, and now that the process has been finalized, some of those same lawmakers say they’re feeling good.
Regier said the bidding process this time around looked a lot like the others, and he’s happy with the outcome because he said it provides transparency.
“We just wanted the bidding process to be transparent — and if they (Intralot) win, they win,” Regier said.
The Senate’s leader also praised fellow members of the state’s upper chamber, saying the issue wasn’t partisan — both Democrats and Republicans demanded transparency. He also said that the “free conference committee” which made the last-minute change to the lottery’s bidding process in 2023 was a big reason the Legislature, which met earlier in 2025, didn’t rely as heavily on free conference committees.
A free conference committee is an ad-hoc group of lawmakers who convene to wrap up legislation and put the finish touches on the final few bills of the session. However, at those free conference committees, lawmaker participation is often variable, and the changes happen quickly, often without public notice or much debate. That was the case in 2023 when the small loophole was created for the lottery commission which was getting ready to bid the next contract, and no one could track exactly who made the change and how it came to be because of the chaotic, last-minute nature of the session’s end.
Still, the experience left unanswered questions for Regier and some of his colleagues.
“It does make you question the vendor, their connections and why they don’t want the competition,” he said.
Intralot’s bid came in at 5 cents on the dollar, less than its current rate of 8 cents. It was also 8 cents on the dollar lower than the next closest bid.
In addition to transparency, the deal provides stability, including a seven-year contract, a potential for new revenue and new gaming machines and software proponents say will give Montana sports betting a better user experience.
Montana Lottery Director Bob Brown was contacted several times by the Daily Montanan, but did not return calls about the new deal.
But, the state of the state’s sports lottery isn’t quite as rosy. Intralot, a multinational company, has struggled with a series of fines and missteps throughout the United States. For example, in Washington, D.C., this year, it was at the center of a scandal that cost the company $6.5 million in fines. While some states, like Idaho, have re-upped contracts with the company, Ohio pulled its contract after a series of problems with its betting kiosks. Meanwhile, at about the same time Montana agreed to a new contract with Intralot, it also brokered a deal with Maryland that has recently collapsed.
Also, a new revenue report suggests that Montana’s cut of sports revenue may be falling. And new research by experts says the state’s restrictive approach may be costing it millions in revenue from offshore sports betting companies, which have become much easier to use through virtual private networks and cryptocurrency.
Kahlil Philander is a professor at Washington State University who studies gambling, gaming and sports betting. He said that Montana may not be as robust of a betting market for several reasons, some which have to do with the structure of sports betting, others because of geographic features.
The most robust state-approved sports betting operations usually have technology that is easy to access and is licensed out to multiple vendors for a fee. For example, Philander said, currently the most popular and used sports betting is through betting apps. Vendors may have their own sports betting programs, but often license other vendors to compete, making a robust, easy-to-use environment.
“When an operator is a monopoly, we find that their product is not as robust,” Philander said.
However, Montana law requires sports betting in the state to be made a kiosk. Currently, Intralot reports that there are 1,300 retailers statewide. Philander said having to go to a brick-and-mortar operation can limit the amount of money a state can take in, and having just one sports betting company, instead a multitude, usually means less competition.
Because gambling enthusiasts have figured out how to work around those obstacles, whether through off-shore betting sites, cryptocurrency, or using VPN connections, he said usually the more restrictive a state is about sports betting, the more money those states lose because sports bettors find ways around state-sanctioned gaming.
The other challenge for Montana, Philander said, is that the market isn’t huge, but the state itself is. That means more technology is spread out, adding to a vendor’s cost. Also, Montana’s population of approximately 1.2 million is small compared with other markets, meaning that some companies may not be interested in all the rules and capital investment for so few betting enthusiasts.
Philander said that the top three sports betting apps command 80% of the market share nationally, leaving smaller operators, like Intralot, bidding for the remainder of the market.
Yet because of Montana’s single vendor with a bricks-and-mortar model, Philander said that the state may believe it’s gotten a good deal, as Intralot lowered its bid, but lose out.
“In markets where you have a monopoly, you’re going to get an OK product, and capture (less than) 50% of the betting market,” Philander said. “That’s because off-shore products can be quite good.”
He said that’s because many of those companies don’t pay taxes, have little overhead and because of the multi-national nature of the business can increase “global liquidity.”
He said off-shore betting used to come with myriad problems of currency and getting money routed internationally. Those hurdles have been somewhat overcome by cryptocurrency.
“I suspect when the state had its first contract with Intralot, it had more market power. There may have been many vendors and many companies wanting to serve the state. There was probably more competition,” Philander said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Regier-SB232-021225.jpg,,,2025-09-25 19:58:22.055041

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Legislative auditors released a report on Thursday that had scathing findings for an office that’s been tasked with monitoring the state’s Medicaid program, saying it has “failed to provide effective oversight” of Utah’s $5 billion Medicaid program.
The Office of the Inspector General of Medicaid Services has a state-mandated mission to guard against instances of “fraud, waste, and abuse,” legislative auditors wrote in their report, but they concluded the office’s leadership has not “made adequate effort” toward those goals.
Lawmakers reviewed that audit on Thursday, when legislative auditors presented their findings to the Legislative Audit Subcommittee. Auditors had a slew of recommendations to address their concerns and improve oversight and accountability for the state’s Medicaid program. 
Those recommendations included three policy options for lawmakers to consider: creating an oversight board, relocating audit responsibilities, or “dismantling the office entirely.” 
The Legislature first created the Office of Inspector General in 2011 — after the Office of the Legislative Auditor General recommended its creation — to oversee the state’s Medicaid program. The legislative audit released Thursday is a follow-up to an initial audit of the Office of Inspector General of Medicaid Services that was first published in 2018, which found that the office “was not assessing risk or completing performance audits of Medicaid and managed care plans, and that the amount of taxpayer dollars recovered should be higher.”

Since that 2018 audit, however, legislative auditors wrote in their report that the Office of Inspector General leaders have “not made adequate effort to improve office performance and oversight of Medicaid’s $5 billion budget, and a change in governance and accountability are needed to improve the effectiveness of the office.”
“Today we find that Medicaid risks continue to increase” due to the program’s growth, legislative auditors wrote in the report. “The (office) has not fulfilled its mandate for Medicaid oversight as envisioned and has not maximized its value. Therefore, this report’s finding compels us to notify the Legislature that this model for Medicaid oversight is not working and major changes are needed.” 
Key findings listed by legislative auditors in their report include: 

Leadership over the Office of Inspector General of Medicaid Services “has failed to adequately prioritize high-impact audits and therefore has been delinquent in fulfilling its duties.” 
The office “does not conduct annual planning, limiting its ability to provide full Medicaid coverage.”
Office leadership has “provided insufficient oversight of accountable care organizations, in which other states have found concerning practices.” 
The office “has failed to improve its office governance and impact.” 
The office has “inconsistent performance practices and some low performance outcomes.”
The office has operated “under a limited oversight structure.” 

Auditors noted that while the office “often performs audits of Medicaid policy and compliance,” like billing practices, only 20% of its audits have focused on “performance or outcomes.” That’s important, auditors wrote, because the Legislature authorized the office to “oversee Medicaid operations and funding, but this has largely remained unaddressed.”
The inspector general “should have been strategically prioritizing audits with the greatest impact on recipients and funds,” auditors wrote, like the resources they were devoting to rooting out fraud and abuse. “Not doing so has left the state open to financial exposure even after we recommended the office improve its approach to reviewing Medicaid” in 2018.
‘Lives are at stake,’ health, food aid advocates say of Medicaid, SNAP cuts in ‘big, beautiful bill’

Overall, legislative auditors wrote that they believe the office’s “lack of oversight has resulted in a less efficient and effective program.”
“Utah needs an improved model for the state’s Medicaid program,” they wrote. 
Auditors added that it’s “worth noting” that their report addresses concerns with “operations and prior leadership” within the Office of Inspector General of Medicaid Services. 
“During this audit, the leadership team within the (office) terminated employment within the office,” they wrote. “Now a new interim leadership team is in place. This audit reviewed the timespan of office activities that ranged from 2018 to 2024, including portions of 2025, before these changes were made.” 
During Thursday’s committee meeting, auditors told lawmakers the office’s previous inspector general, Gene Cottrell, resigned “basically at the end of our audit.” Currently, Neil Erickson is serving as the Utah Office of Inspector General’s interim inspector general.
Erickson said Cottrell, before he resigned, was inspector general for more than 10 years, and he led the office during and after the 2018 audit. Hired by Cottrell, Erickson has worked for the Utah Office of Inspector General since 2015, and in 2017 he was promoted as audit manager, according to the office’s website. Erickson said he was appointed by the governor’s office to serve as interim inspector general after Cottrell resigned. 
Response
Erickson wrote a lengthy, 17-page response to the legislative audit, included in the audit report. He noted that as of Aug. 25, the office “has undergone a complete change of leadership; the former Inspector General and the former Deputy Inspector General have both left the UOIG.” 
“As a result, UOIG has begun to navigate significant changes to its internal structure and organization,” Erickson wrote, adding that the office will “continue to identify areas of opportunity for efficiency and impact, as we seek to continue to fulfill our mandate” under Utah law. 
Erickson noted in his response, however, that “as of the publication of this audit,” the UOIG had not received any documents showing the Office of the Legislative Auditor General was “dissatisfied” with the office’s response to the 2018 audit. 
“Consequently, it is the belief of the UOIG that previous leadership implemented the 2018 recommendations based upon the understanding of and response to the 2018 audit,” Erickson wrote, adding that the office “believed it had demonstrated efforts to meet or exceed the actions outlined” in their response to that audit, but it also “welcomes continued collaboration” with legislative auditors to implement their new recommendations. 
“It is the goal and mission of the UOIG to strengthen Medicaid Program Integrity and Oversight functions, to protect taxpayer dollars, and to mitigate risk,” Erickson wrote. “Medicaid Members and Utah taxpayers depend on the health and sustainability of the Medicaid Program.” 
Erickson said the office’s staff “would be happy to meet” with legislators and other state officials to discuss the audit, their response and “any recommendation implementation.” 
Utah hospitals ‘deeply concerned’ about Medicaid cuts. Rural areas could lose an estimated $870M

Erickson wrote that the UOIG agreed with most of the legislative auditors’ recommendations, but he noted that the office sees “potential challenges” from the recommendation that lawmakers “dismantle” the office and relocate its functions. He wrote that the office currently works to meet state and federal requirements for “Medicaid program integrity,” and if the office gets reallocated or dismantled, lawmakers would need to consider those impacts. 
“The need for independence from Medicaid that led to the creation of the Office in 2011 also remains,” Erickson wrote, adding that relocating the office within the Utah Department of Health and Human Services “could recreate the same circumstances that resulted in the unsuccessful outcomes that originally led” to the office’s creation. 
“The UOIG remains committed to incorporating best practice and increasing its effectiveness in the pursuit of identifying and mitigating risk to the Medicaid program, to Medicaid Members, and to Utah taxpayer dollars,” Erickson wrote. 
He also suggested reporting directly to the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee to “help increase the visibility of the Office and provide meaningful context” to help legislators. 
As lawmakers were questioning how the inspector general’s office continued to fall short after the 2018 audit, Erickson said during Thursday’s meeting he believes the issue boils down to a “matter of interpretation.” 
He said in talking with legislative auditors over the last month, the office has gained “a better understanding” of what legislative auditors expect an audit of Medicaid “accountable care organizations” — or groups of providers that work with Medicaid — should look like. 
“We have a different understanding within our organization, but we want to marry that,” Erickson said. “We want to work together so that we’re able to fulfill those obligations.”

One unintended consequence of Nexstar Media Group’s continued preempting of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on its ABC affiliates, including WTNH in New Haven, was to demonstrate that network affiliates are not necessary to view network programming.
The 28-minute monologue Kimmel delivered Tuesday night after ABC ended his suspension was viewed 20.7 million times on YouTube in 24 hours, more than triple the audience when it aired on ABC.
To Rich Hanley, a long-time journalism professor at Quinnipiac University, the huge YouTube numbers and modest turnout at a hastily organized protest Thursday outside WTNH were evidence of the same thing: the growing irrelevance of local affiliates in viewing television programming.
“Local network affiliates, along with their broadcasting parents, are in steep decline, and I think the fact that the protest was small reflects the size of the audience. It’s diminished greatly as people, particularly folks who are native to the internet, find other sources for news,” Hanley said.


State Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, one of three elected officials who addressed the protesters Thursday, denounced the Trump administration’s role in pressuring Nexstar, which is seeking FCC approval of looser limits on station ownership, to silence Kimmel, a caustic critic of President Donald Trump.
“Some people like Jimmy Kimmel. Some people think he’s funny. Some people don’t think he’s funny,” Lesser said. “If you don’t like what Jimmy Kimmel has to say, change the channel. But it is not — it is not—  the White House’s job, it is not the FCC’s job, to tell us who we’re allowed to see on TV.”
The previous day, Gov. Ned Lamont called on WTNH to put Kimmel back on the air. 
“I think if you’re a champion of free speech, you want to make sure government is not getting in the way,” Lamont said. “Corporations can’t tell us what’s appropriate in the political sector or not. I want WTNH to get him back on the air.”
ABC and its parent, Disney, announced an indefinite suspension of Kimmel’s show on Sept. 17, a response to criticism over Kimmel’s comments about the man charged in the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. It lifted the suspension five days later, though Nexstar and Sinclair, another significant owner of ABC affiliates, refused to go along.
Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, has suggested the government may yet act to force ABC to once against remove Kimmel, and the president threatened a lawsuit against ABC.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., denounced Trump in an appearance Wednesday night on CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”
“What he suggests is that, you know, speaking against him is an illegal campaign contribution to Democrats. Well, then the entirety of Fox News is one big illegal campaign contribution,” Murphy said.
The Colbert audience laughed and applauded.
“But it’s not,” Murphy continued. “It’s not, because if you want to be a TV network that loads up coverage criticizing the president, you can. If you want to be a TV network that loads up support for the president, you can.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is circulating an online petition demanding Carr’s resignation over his threats to strip broadcast licenses from critics.
“That’s not free speech,” Blumenthal said. “That’s authoritarianism. And it cannot stand.”
At the protest, others urged a boycott of advertisers on WTNH, and one said the episode raised questions about whether Nexstar also was willing to interfere in local news coverage, though she pointed to no evidence of it happening. 
The episode is awkward for WTNH, whose executives have been advised to stay silent, according to one station official.
The station declined comment on the protest or the scope of calls and emails either protesting or supporting the continued preemption. All questions were referred to a corporate spokesman in Irving, Texas, who did not respond to a request for comment.
Lesser said he had sympathy for WTNH personnel, who had no say in the corporate decision, but the station is the Connecticut face of the publicly traded company, whose stock closed Thursday at $198.10, down $1.20 for the day.
Nexstar has an agreement to acquire a competitor, Tegna, for $6 billion. The deal would give Nexstar a second television station in Connecticut: Tegna’s holdings include FOX61 in Hartford. Without a change in FCC ownership rules, the expanded company would face having to sell some stations.
“Concentration of media ownership is a problem, and if Nexstar is going to buckle to Brendan Carr on this issue, and then they’re able to dominate the Hartford-New Haven region media market, what’s the next issue they’re going to buckle on?” Lesser said. “What is the next issue they’re going to sell us out to on orders from the White House or on orders from the FCC?”

Lesser said he has asked Attorney General William Tong if the acquisition would violate state antitrust law.
Rep. Kaitlyn Shake, D-Stratford, and New Haven Alderman Eli Sabin also addressed the protesters. The protest was organized by the Connecticut Citizen Action Group.
WTNH posted a story about it on its web site.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Forest Service)Tribal lands in the Pacific Northwest are earning national recognition for something the U.S. Forest Service has struggled to achieve: healthy, resilient forests.
Despite receiving less than 40 cents for every federal dollar spent on national forests, tribes are restoring forest health and reducing tree mortality. Their success is rooted in thousands of years of stewardship and a willingness to act where federal policy too often stalls.
Long before European colonization, Indigenous people actively managed forests through cultural burning and selective thinning to clear underbrush, promote desired species, and prevent catastrophic wildfires. 
“In my neck of the woods, there was a five to 15 year fire return interval that was clearly from tribal management,” said Cody Desautel, executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which extends across Washington and into British Columbia, Oregon, and Idaho.  
Upon settlement, tribes were forced onto reservations, and their territories were tied up in trusts. Contrary to a millennium of Indigenous wisdom, subsequent government policy excluded fire from the landscape and opted for a “hands-off” approach that scaled back active stewardship.
“When you’re not managing these forest types like they were previously managed, Mother Nature is going to have a course correction and reset the clock,” said Steve Rigdon, tribal partnership stewardship and resource manager at Sustainable Northwest, and a member of the Yakama Nation. 
That course correction has arrived. Western forests are now a matchbox: overly dense and ripe for wildfire. Over the past three decades, 216 million acres of wildland have burned across the country. 
Tribes have long recognized that the forests are out of balance. 
“Indigenous people have been tied to these landscapes for thousands and thousands of years,” Rigdon said. “We know they need disturbance. They need the prescribed fire. They need the fuel reductions.” 
But, for much of the 20th century, tribes relied on timber sale revenue and prioritized production over restoration. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency responsible for fulfilling the government’s trust responsibility to tribes, also formerly assumed a more paternalistic role and dictated extractive logging policies on tribal lands.
That changed with a series of policy shifts. 
First, in the 1970s, Congress enacted self-determination laws that offered tribes more autonomy to govern their lands according to their cultural values. Then, in the 1980s, tribes began receiving revenue from casinos and tax compacts with states, which displaced timber revenues. 
These changes facilitated tribes’ movement away from production-focused forestry towards traditional silvicultural practices. In 1983, 80% of the Colville Confederated Tribe’s revenue came from timber. Today, timber accounts for just 20%. 
Tribes now prioritize a suite of ecosystem services from clean water, to cultural plants and big game. Rooted in ancient beliefs, “We feel a deep recognition and obligation to improve the conditions for those things that provide for us,” Desautel said. “Logs and revenues are a byproduct of what we’re actually trying to accomplish, not the goal.”
Tribes leave the healthiest overstory trees on the landscape to promote resilience from disturbances like insects, disease, and fire. Then, they apply prescribed burning, salvage logging, selective thinning, and other treatments aimed to mimic the conditions their ancestors promoted. 
Jerry Franklin, one of America’s foremost forest ecologists and an architect of the Northwest Forest Plan, endorses Indigenous forestry practices. Franklin recommends aggressive restoration, especially in dry, fire-prone forests. “You have to save the old trees, then go to work on the rest of the forest,” Franklin said.
The data affirms Indigenous approaches. Tribal forests are among the healthiest in the country, even as they bear the consequences of centuries of federal mismanagement. Since 2015, 800,000 of the Colville Tribe’s 1.4 million-acre reservation has burned in fires. The Yakama Nation has suffered a similar fate.  
Other landowners are worse off. Mortality rates on tribal forests are 39% to 113% lower than those on comparable National Forests, which often lack sustainable management. 
On the heels of their success, tribes are finally gaining a voice in federal forest policy. 
“When I look at where we’ve been for the last 10 years, there seems to be a recognition in Congress at least, that tribes are more effective than other federal land managers,” Desautel said. Recently, Congress has granted several authorities. Most notably, the 2018 Farm Bill and the expansion of Good Neighbor Authority, which offer pathways for increased self-governance and more tribal control over forests. 
Last year, over 60 co-stewardship agreements were signed between tribes and national forests. In November, the Forest Service published a draft amendment to the Northwest Forest Plan, which manages 24.5 million acres across California, Oregon, and Washington. Over half of the amendment involved tribal stewardship, a landmark policy prescription, considering the 1994 plan failed to consult tribes entirely. 
“We hope to correct that and make sure Indigenous voices are not just engaged, but actively involved in management,” said Travis Joseph, co-president of the Northwest Forest Plan Advisory Committee.
As the national tide turns, environmental organizations are also emphasizing Indigenous forestry. “Twenty years ago, we used to fight with the environmental NGOs like cats and dogs… now there seems to be a lot of alignment,” Desautel said.
Conservation groups like Sustainable Northwest are educating federal agencies on treaty rights and mimicking tribal prescriptions for land management. “We recognize that the forests are [Tribes’] ceded lands,” said Dylan Kruse, the executive director of Sustainable Northwest. “We say, fund them to do the treatments they want to do.”
A seat at the table is only part of the equation. As co-management efforts have increased, federal funding remains limited, leaving tribes understaffed and underfinanced.
The most recent Indian Forest Management Assessment Team report, which evaluates the government’s management of tribal lands, recommends allocating $313 million a year to tribal forestry and fire management. Last year, tribes received half of that. 
Since 2001, the gap between federal investments in the Forest Service and tribes has been steadily rising, as tribal funding remains stagnant. For every dollar the Forest Service receives, tribes get 30 to 40 cents. 
The lack of funding has caused staffing shortages, which make it difficult for tribes to meet annual harvest volumes and implement silvicultural treatments. 
“It’s like, how do you expect us to meet these goals and objectives without having the people to do the job?” Rigdon said. 
Each tribal and Bureau of Indian Affairs staff member manages double the acreage of their Forest Service counterparts, and over six times that of the Bureau of Land Management. In many cases, increases in project funds have proven irrelevant because tribes lack the staff to implement them. 
To compensate for their limited resources, tribes rely on dedicated staff and more flexible regulatory frameworks.
In recent years, tribes have prioritized hiring Native foresters. Today, Native Americans comprise half of the tribal and Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry workforce, a shift that, according to Desautel, fosters a deeper sense of accountability to their communities. 
“Their dedication and work ethic is really unlike anything you see in other federal or state agencies,” Desautel said.
Tribes are subject to the same laws as any other federal agency, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. But, tribes have more flexibility in how they follow environmental laws and regulations because tribal lands are held in trusts, which give them the right to use and benefit from the land.
While federal agencies are focused on the legal risks of implementing treatments, tribes prioritize ecological outcomes. “For a Forest Service agent, it’s not, ‘What does this stand need to be healthy, fire resilient, and free of insects and disease?’” Desautel said. “He’s thinking about, ‘If I treat this block, am I going to go to court?’” 
As a result, tribes respond faster to forest health issues through silvicultural treatments and salvage operations than federal land managers. 
One tribal authority that Kruse, with Sustainable Northwest, is looking to capitalize on is third-party National Environmental Policy Act analysis. Normally, when any management plan is implemented on national forests, a federal agency’s staff must complete its NEPA-required analysis, a process that can take years. 
Tribes, however, can conduct this analysis independently and contract environmental reviews for upcoming forest projects to non-agency personnel. 
“Think about an A-team of top scientists and lawyers all working together to say, ‘Everything we’ve fought about in court, and all the science that we know about that everyone’s been ignoring, let’s do it ourselves,” Kruse said.
The problem is, tribes lack the funding to execute third-party NEPA. That’s where Sustainable Northwest comes in. Over the last several months, the organization has submitted concepts on three forests in Oregon where they have longstanding partnerships with the Klamath, among other tribes. They hope that if approved, these projects will increase acres treated and decrease litigation. 
Limited budgets keep many tribes from using their most effective tools, such as third-party National Environmental Policy Act analyses, at the scale needed to confront today’s wildfire and climate crises. To address this, organizations like Sustainable Northwest are collaborating with tribes to implement projects that speed up treatments and reduce legal delays. These partnerships show what’s possible and highlight the need for policies and investments that empower tribes to lead at a landscape level.
 “A tribal approach would help fix many of the management issues we see,” Desautel said. “But the solution is not going to be quick. The question is, several hundred years after we’re gone, what will people see on the landscape, and will we have made the situation better than it was when we got it?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/colville-national-forest.jpg,,,2025-09-25 18:57:55.102094

New Mexico environment officials approved the wastewater permit on Thurday, Sept. 25, 2025.(Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico’s top environmental official on Thursday signed off on a wastewater permit requested by a luxury resort and nearby homes that has sparked ongoing objections by residents in nearby Tesuque Village.
Environment Secretary James Kenney gave final approval on the permit allowing Bishop’s Lodge to put 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The previous permit allowed Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.
“Bishop’s Lodge’s water treatment system meets all standards under the Water Quality Act,” Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson for NMED, said in a statement provided to Source NM. “The Department retains the authority to conduct future testing and will do so to assure continued compliance for the protection of public health.”
Kenney’s sign-off follows a Sept. 8 recommendation from a hearing officer after nearly a year of proceedings. An organization of residents called Protect Tesuque have mounted weekly protests, and filed objections during administrative proceedings and in the courts, claiming the method will pollute drinking wells downstream, and that state officials are unequally enforcing water treatment standards. In July, the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out an emergency petition to stop the permitting process.
NM environment official recommends Bishop’s Lodge receive controversial sewage permit

Kenney noted in his final order that Bishop’s Lodge completed the required sampling of the treated wastewater for a list of pollutants, the results of which showed undetectable amounts or ones below the standard. No additional testing will be required.
Bishop’s Lodge declined to give a comment Thursday. After the initial approval earlier this month, Chris Kaplan, the head of Asset Management at Juniper Capital, which owns the resort told Source NM: “Bishop’s Lodge has been in operation for more than half a century; and, as the report acknowledged, the evidence presented in the May 2025 hearing demonstrates that the Lodge’s upgraded wastewater treatment facility meets all New Mexico water quality standards and then some.”
Requests for comment to representatives for Protect Tesuque remained pending Thursday afternoon.
Bishop’s Lodge and members of Protect Teusque are currently embroiled in a separate lawsuit. The resort’s owners sued individual Protect Tesuque board members, requesting a district judge ban protests in front of the resort within a 1-mile radius, claiming they are a danger to drivers and veers into harassment.
Protect Tesuque has said the claims are exaggerated and is a form of retaliation for opposing the sewage permits.
A Santa Fe judge scheduled a hearing for Nov. 3 in that matter.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)MITCHELL — Cody Kafka had dreamed of farming his own land since he began working on a farm in his teens, but that seemed unlikely without land to inherit. So it felt good when he finally walked across his own acres for the first time this year. 
“It was one of the most freeing feelings I’ve ever really felt,” Kafka said. 
He owed the feeling to a little-known program administered by the state.
Kafka and his wife, Codi, who live in Alexandria, started thinking seriously about getting into farming last year. But finding a lender was difficult until the Kafkas came across South Dakota’s Beginning Farmer Bond Program. 
“Without this program, I don’t think it would have been possible,” Kafka said. 
Trump-China trade dispute heightens harvest anxiety for South Dakota soybean farmers

Kafka, an ag-equipment salesman in Mitchell, and his wife, an accountant, were approved this year for the program along with one other applicant. 
The program facilitates the sale of bonds to purchasers who receive federally tax-exempt interest, enabling loans to first-generation farmers at low interest rates. The program helps new farmers acquire land, equipment or livestock. Awardees must farm the land, not just own it.
Board members affiliated with the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which administers the program, approved a total of $4.6 million in bonds for 13 applicants statewide from 2019 to this year, an average of about $354,000 per award. The office said it has received no reports of awardees not paying off loans on time.
High land and equipment costs mean aspiring farmers face limited access to credit, and modern farming methods have allowed fewer farmers to farm more land.
U.S. Department of Agriculture reports show the number of farms in the state dropped from 34,000 in 1994 to 28,300 in 2024. The sharpest declines occurred among medium-sized farms. Large-scale farms operating on 2,000 acres or more now control over two-thirds of the cropland in the state, according to a South Dakota State University report. Thirty years ago, large farms controlled less than half of the state’s cropland.
And those aren’t the only challenges facing new farmers.
“Commodity prices fluctuating, droughts, excessive rain, etcetera,” Kafka said. “It really is a risky business, and so it was very, very nerve-racking to take a big financial step such as this.”
The Kafkas received $510,000 to purchase 160 acres near Gregory. This spring, Cody Kafka planted corn.
For Bill Even, commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, overseeing the program is personally gratifying. When he was a young, “asset-poor farmer,” he said, a U.S. Department of Agriculture farmer loan program “allowed me the chance to buy my first piece of farm ground.”
Even said that without that program’s low-interest rate, plus his own equity and a commercial lender, he wouldn’t have been able to get established.
Kafka said he was turned down for a USDA farmer loan because he did not have the required farm income history. That’s when he came across the state-administered program online.
“It’s still stringent — you need balance sheets, cash flows, all of that,” he said. “But they want people exactly like us, with little experience but stable finances, to get a chance.”
Kafka said he is working to improve the soil health of his new land, and experimenting with cover crops, rotational grazing and regenerative practices. 
The math is tough this year. Corn prices are down nearly a dollar per bushel from what the Kafkas budgeted. 
“We’re penciling in a loss,” Kafka said.
But they view the land as a long-term investment. With off-farm income to cushion their losses, he hopes to weather the early years. 
“Land hasn’t depreciated since the 1980s,” he said. “That, and it’ll be paid for in 20 years. And, hopefully, I’ll live another 20 after that.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0696-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-25 18:57:55.102094

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to require more “healthy” food on the shelves of retailers participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
According to a news release from the department, this decision fits with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. In Iowa, it could make it more difficult for small, nontraditional stores to participate in the program and therefore lower SNAP accessibility. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release that the “common sense” changes would minimize “fraudulent activities” in the federal nutrition program and ensure greater availability of nutritious foods to participants. 
“Retailers participating in SNAP need to sell real food, plain and simple,” Rollins said in the release. “Right now, the bar for stocking food as a SNAP retailer is far too low, allowing people to game the system and leaving vulnerable Americans without healthy food options.” 
Currently USDA requires that SNAP retailers sell three varieties of each of the four “staple food” categories. That means they must have at least three options for fruits or vegetables, dairy products, protein and grain. These staple items, according to USDA must be continuously stocked and have at least three stocking units.

Under the proposed changes from USDA, retailers would need to stock seven varieties in each staple food category. According to the release, the change also “closes loopholes” that allow snack products to count toward staple food varieties. The department said this change emphasizes “healthy, whole food.”
According to the press release, there are 266,000 SNAP participating retailers across the country. USDA data shows there are more than 3,000 retailers in Iowa and more than 1,400 of those retailers are convenience stores. 
John Maynes, the president of FUELIowa which represents fuel distributors and convenience stores in Iowa, said many members with the association are “mom and pop shops” in rural parts of the state that sell the “daily essentials” to their communities, which may or may not have a traditional grocery store in town.
“What I’ve heard from our convenience store industry, particularly the small mom and pop shops throughout rural Iowa that accept SNAP and provide access points for the users of SNAP, it’s really a wait-and-see approach,” Maynes said. “They’re trying to see how all this is going to come together.” 
Maynes said for stores like that, distribution, storage and space are all challenges that could make it difficult to comply with USDA’s increased stocking requirements.
“SNAP participation for a retailer is a voluntary program,” Maynes said. “And ultimately, the businesses who offer or accept SNAP payments, they’re going to have to look at it and see if the continued acceptance of SNAP payment is going to be worth their time and effort to comply with the changing requirements.” 
USDA’s statement on the changes said the current low stocking requirements make SNAP vulnerable to fraud and abuse from retailers that aren’t “genuinely” selling food and want to “cash in on taxpayer-funded benefits.” 
“No amount of fraud will be tolerated,” USDA said in the release. 
USDA cancels food security report that anti-hunger advocates say showed the effects of food policies

The National Grocers Association said in a statement it supports the stocking requirement changes from USDA. 
“American consumers deserve access to a wide variety of foods, including perishable and shelf stable, and having access to full service supermarkets and other retailers that offer these items is essential to building strong communities,” the association said. 
While it supported the changes, the grocers association asked lawmakers and USDA to continue funding programs like Double Up Food Bucks and the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program, which help incentivize the purchase of fresh produce with SNAP dollars. 
Chris Schwartz, executive director of the Iowa Food System Coalition, said the changes “might have some good benefits” in increasing healthy food availability, but they could also “backfire and create more food deserts” as retailers stop accepting SNAP. 
“At the end of the day, if the USDA really wants to get healthy food on the table for all Iowans and all Americans alike, we need to start investing in local food systems and table food production at the same level that we do with commodity crops,” Schwartz said. 
Schwartz said that means investing into these systems “on the front end” and reinstating programs like Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance, both of which were canceled in March.
More SNAP changes coming to Iowa
Maynes said the convenience store retailers that he represents are in a “wait and see” situation, not only with the latest news from USDA, but also as they approach the implementation date of Iowa’s SNAP waiver. 
This waiver, proposed by Gov. Kim Reynolds and approved by USDA in May, restricts foods eligible for state sales tax, like candy, soft drinks, and sweetened snacks, from being purchased with SNAP. 
Iowa is one of 12 states to exclude certain foods from SNAP in their states via the waivers, which have been approved by Rollins.
Maynes said retailers have been working with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services for implementation instructions, but said it’s a “slow-moving process.
This waiver would not impact retailer stocking requirements so much as it would affect checkout procedures. Maynes said retailers want to make sure education about the new rules will be offered to SNAP participants to avoid uncomfortable situations at the checkout counter.
“We want to make sure that we’re keeping a positive experience for everybody who’s coming into the private business, and not having situations where we’re having to explain what can be purchased, what can’t be purchased, user to user,” Maynes said. 
The waiver goes into place Jan. 1, 2026, which Maynes said is a “tight timeline.” 
USDA’s proposed retailer stocking requirements are open to public comment through Nov. 24, 2025 on the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY — U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Thursday plans to boost American farmers by purchasing millions of bushels of crops.
In an effort to increase American exports, the USDA will purchase 417,000 metric tons of commodities immediately to support the international food aid programs. That’s equivalent to more than 16 million bushels of corn and sorghum.
Rollins made the announcement during a speech that earned a standing ovation at the Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, where she outlined the Trump Administration’s efforts to aid a struggling farm economy.
“The cost of doing business for our farmers has increased drastically while commodity prices have slipped,” Rollins said.
The large purchase would benefit America First International Food Assistance programs, the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program and Food for Progress, which rely on U.S.-grown crops.
Rollins outlined a series of dire economic challenges facing farmers and ranchers in the United States, blaming the Biden administration for inflation and policies that “all but ignored the needs” of farmers.
Since 2020, the cost of seed has risen 18%, the cost of fuel rose 30%, labor costs are up 47%, electricity up 36%, machinery up 45% and fertilizer up 37%, she said. Largest of all was a 73% increase in interest expenses.
To address rising costs for farmers, Rollins said the Federal Reserve needs to keep lowering interest rates. The Trump administration is also reportedly repurposing “Biden DEI,” or diversity, equity and inclusion funds. Those could benefit farmers as soon as Oct. 2.
She touted seven new international trade deals, including 99% tariffs on Indonesia, increased rice exports from Japan and an ethanol deal with the United Kingdom.
Out of concern for undue foreign influence in American agriculture, Rollins also announced that the USDA and the U.S. Department of Justice signed a joint memorandum Thursday morning to scrutinize the agriculture marketplace through antitrust enforcement that promotes market competition, effective immediately.
Rollins addressed a pressing beef cattle shortage, which partially has to do with low inventory, a loss of cattle ranches and disease risk. Over the past decade, the U.S. has lost about 150,000 cattle operations, Rollins said. Many have been offshored or consolidated. U.S. cattle inventory is at its lowest in 75 years, she said.
She also promised new dietary guidelines for Americans that encourage beef, protein and whole milk consumption.
However, the USDA has no current plans to offer payments to beef producers.
“We see how the government getting involved can completely distort the markets, and so currently there will be no plan,” Rollins said. “No plan is even under consideration to insert ourselves through payments into the beef cattle industry.”
Instead, Rollins said, the government will focus on freeing up land, using funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill for animal disease prevention, and, “hopefully inspiring the next generation of farmers.”
She told reporters following the speech that the USDA is not yet ready to announce a payment plan to aid farmers. During the first Trump administration, farmers received around $23 million in subsidies.
Also on Thursday, President Donald Trump told reporters he would use tariff revenue to bail out farmers, who have been disproportionately hurt by tariff policies, according to reporting from Politico.

For two weeks last spring, students and professors from Vermont State University collected cores of snow, sea ice and permafrost to uncover more about what's hidden beneath the surface.

Picture flat white snow as far as the horizon. No trees, no rolling mountains. Just an endless scene of ice and frozen earth underneath an illuminated sky with the sun high in the air, regardless of the time of day.
This is what Castleton junior Environmental Science major Olivia Rutkowski saw as she stepped off the snowmobile in Cambridge Bay, Canada, this past May.
For two weeks, Rutkowski and five others lived and worked in the Arctic, collecting cores of snow, sea ice and permafrost to uncover more about the microbes hidden beneath the surface.
The research effort is in collaboration with the Dynamic Research of Arctic Cryospheric Organisms team, or DRACO. It’s a group of professors and students researching polar environments down to the nanoscale. The project is led by associate professors Ross Lieblappen and Michelle Sama of Vermont State University Randolph.
Joining them were environmental science and chemistry professor from Castleton Andrew Vermilyea and VTSU Randolph student researchers Elizabeth Goodell and Dominic Mazzilli.
“I’ve done field work around Castleton and Poultney, but this was my first time going out of the country to do it. It was definitely a new experience,” Rutkowski said.
The first week of the trip was spent snowmobiling over seven feet of ice to locations 15 to 45 minutes away to get samples of snow by ice drilling. The group would get as many samples as the day allowed to have thorough data pulled.
Before the day could end, the group would head back to the lab to process the samples.
“For my samples, it was putting them in a bucket, putting them in an incubator, melting them down, filtering all that water, assigning it a code so that I know which site it’s from,” Rutkowski said.
Rutkowski and Vermilyea are a part of a slightly different research effort.
“We’re looking at microplastics in pristine environments like the Arctic. The ocean, when we pull sea ice samples, our global oceans are connected. As plastics just degrade, they can be transported there, and you can see them in ice and water up there. They also can end up in the atmosphere, microplastics. From burning and processing of plastic and all kinds of reasons, and then can hang around up there for a long time and be deposited with rain and snow,” Vermilyea said.
Much of the work done in the field also transfers to further research after returning home.
Vermilyea adds that looking ahead for Rutkowski and her studies, the time she is putting in back in Castleton will be focused on developing more methods to research microplastics in soils, and accurately quantify them.
“Two weeks of field work creates two years of work,” Vermilyea said.

The second week of research consisted of collecting permafrost cores, which can be compared to solid cores of frozen soil. These extracted cores are gathered by drilling down using a corer, and on some occasions it can take multiple hours, if the corer were to stop spinning and freeze to the ground.
“Sure enough, we got the core barrels frozen in the ground, about a foot down. It’s frozen ground. You can’t yank that out, no matter how strong you are. Rather than going home for dinner, now we’re at it for four hours, chipping away at it. One person had like a pickax, one person had a chisel with a hammer, and we just took turns. We had a little bit of movement. So, one person was holding the core barrel, trying to keep it moving as much as possible to not freeze it more,” Lieblappen said.
After being awarded funding in 2023 by the US Army Corps of Engineers’ Engineer Research and Development Center (or ERDC), Lieblappen and his team invested in a state-of-the-art nano-CT scanner located on the Randolph campus to capture images of permafrost, snow, and sea ice down to the micron level.
The trip to Cambridge Bay was DRACO’s fourth research fieldwork trip. June 2024 brought them to Fairbanks, Alaska, and a month later, in July, they were in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Earlier this year, between February and March, the group was in Utqiagvik, Alaska.
Their goal is to fully characterize terrain from different geographical locations, like collecting permafrost from regions that are far apart from each other.
“The idea being that these biomes that have microbes there could potentially be very distinct. So, we want to kind of have a wide sampling of regions of the Arctic that we’re grouping,” Lieblappen said.

But the work doesn’t end after the cores and samples are collected and brought back to the lab in heavily insulated core boxes full of heavy-duty ice packs or a cryoshipper, basically a freezer. These shipping containers can keep the samples frozen and cold for about 48 hours, and are constantly being temperature-watched and tracked during travel.
“If the samples thaw out on the way home, it’s all for nothing. That’s the most worrying part when you’re traveling home and you’re waiting for baggage claim,” Vermilyea said.
These fieldwork trips offer students valuable hands-on skills, professors said.
“They do everything. The students do literally everything. It’s hands-on learning at its core. Olivia was driving the snowmobile with gear. She was running the corer with a big auger engine head on it. She was in the lab processing and filtering samples, taking notes. It’s just such a learning experience, but they’re not just hanging around and observing,” Vermilyea said.
For undergraduates, having this level of responsibility is rare. Lieblappen emphasized how unique these opportunities are for students, especially at VTSU.
“Undergraduate students are the ones being able to use state-of-the-art equipment, making these discoveries, doing all the work themselves, which is something that’s really unique for a place like VTSU. I think there’s a lot of opportunity both in terms of the personal manner aspect, but also in terms of the professional development that they get, and the opportunities that they have, and the confidence that they can do groundbreaking science. They can be out there, being the ones that make these discoveries,” Lieblappen said.
Looking ahead for DRACO, a summer 2026 trip is in the early planning phases. In an effort to remain far from Cambridge Bay, the team is brainstorming locations like Ellesmere Island, Canada, or northern Greenland.
The hands-on nature of the Arctic fieldwork, combined with exposure to cutting-edge equipment, gives students like Rutkowski confidence and a tangible foundation for future research.
“It sets up a path for my career. I’ve always wanted to do cold-weather research. Having this experience puts a foot in the door to more Arctic or Antarctic experiences, more opportunities for cold-weather research. It was an amazing experience for sure,” Rutkowski said.
Lieblappen said the work was funded by the Broad Agency Announcement Program of the U.S. Army Research and Development Center and that “opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations” from it don’t necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring agencies.

Are protections coming?,Mike Koshmrl,,,,,https://wyofile.com/the-state-halted-proposed-migration-safeguards-for-wyoming-range-mule-deer-6-years-ago-are-protections-coming/,"

Wildlife advocates are pushing the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to refocus attention on another long-delayed Green River Basin ungulate corridor following a recommendation to designate the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration. 
The post The state halted proposed migration safeguards for Wyoming Range mule deer 6 years ago. Are protections coming? appear[...]","The tens of thousands of mule deer that call the Wyoming Range home constitute perhaps one of the most famous, best-studied ungulate herds in North America. 
Its super-sized bucks attract all sorts of attention. Its migratory animals have been the subject of documentary films and a wide-ranging University of Wyoming-led ecological examination that’s been going for a dozen years and counting. 
And so it was no surprise that in 2019 the Wyoming Game and Fish Department proposed to protect the 130-mile route that braids across the Wyoming and Salt River ranges from Star Valley and the Hoback Rim to Kemmerer and La Barge.  
But within the year, that proposal was pulled back indefinitely after an alliance of industry groups urged Wyoming to hit the brakes on making wildlife-friendly designations on landscapes that are also home to private property, oil and gas fields and livestock grazing allotments. Out of that resistance came Wyoming’s current migration policy: an executive order that gives the governor final say. 
Now that new approach has allowed one wildlife migration corridor to move toward designation for the first time. The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission unanimously recommended protections for the entirety of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration routes — another proposal that traces to 2019 — at its September meeting. That plan is now sitting on Gov. Mark Gordon’s desk, according to Sara DiRienzo, his senior policy advisor.
“The Governor looks forward to thoroughly reviewing the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission’s recommendation [about Sublette pronghorn] and making a determination about next steps,” DiRienzo wrote in an email. 
In the meantime, wildlife advocates are urging Game and Fish to hit the gas on the other 6-year-old proposal and restart the process of designating a migration corridor for the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Herd.
“I personally feel like there’s widespread agreement that the herd should be a priority for designation,” said Meghan Riley, wildlife program manager for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. “It’s a struggling population. There’s multiple demands on the landscape. And the state has really made so many huge investments in trying to prop up that herd already: wildlife crossing projects, tons of money on research and some dabbling in predator control.”

Josh Metten, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership’s Wyoming field manager, agreed that the “timing is good” to make moves on protections for Wyoming Range mule deer. 
“We’re also dealing with Bridger-Teton Forest Plan revisions,” Metten said. “And it’s really important for Wyomingites to consider: What is the message that we’re sending to our federal partners regarding the primacy of Wyoming wildlife management if we’re not giving clear direction on how to manage these migrations?” 
For the time being, state wildlife managers aren’t jumping into the process of identifying and designating the Wyoming Range Mule Deer migration — or any new corridors at this time. 
“I think we’re kind of in a holding pattern,” said Jill Randall, Game and Fish’s statewide migration coordinator. “I’m hoping the governor moves fairly quickly on this so that we can keep moving, but that’s to be determined.”
The reason for the holding pattern, she explained, is because steps remain in codifying safeguards for the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration corridor. If the governor agrees with Game and Fish commissioners, he’ll convene an “area working group” to examine the proposal.
“Supporting the local working group process … that will take a fair bit of support from the department,” Randall said.

It’s a process that is keeping Randall busy, and it hasn’t even started. Currently, she’s updating 50 or so maps from an assessment of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migrations to include recent GPS collar data so that it’s ready for the working group. 
It’s tough to say what the “area working group” process will look like, or if members will encounter bottlenecks in deliberations. Wyoming’s migration policy does not specify a process. It does outline membership, directing the governor to select a county commissioner from each affected county; two representatives for agriculture; two representatives for oil and gas and mining; two representatives for hunting, conservation and wildlife; and one representative for motorized outdoor recreation. 
Game and Fish officials will revisit a spreadsheet of eligible deer and pronghorn migrations once that process wraps up, Randall said. There are roughly a dozen routes that are on the table, she said, and ultimately the decision about what comes next will be made by Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce’s office.
There are compelling reasons to take up the Wyoming Range Mule Deer migration next, Randall said. There’s a “great data set,” “a lot of public interest” and they’re “highly migratory” and “running the whole length of the Salt and Wyoming Range,” she said. 
But there are also pitfalls, she added.
“It’s such a huge data set, and we’re still collecting data actively,” Randall said. “Those are two factors we need to talk through.”

Nevertheless, there may be pressure on the state agency to prioritize the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Herd migration. Ken Roberts, a Game and Fish commissioner from Kemmerer, remarked that seeing protections move forward was a top priority during a September 2024 discussion about the Upper Wind River Mule Deer Herd’s migrations, which the state agency opted to “identify,” but not designate. 
Game and Fish staffer Doug Brimeyer responded to the commissioner’s comment. 
“It’s a priority for us,” said Brimeyer, who’s now the agency’s deputy director. “We’re hoping to get there at some point, but we’re not there yet.” 
If the long-delayed safeguards for the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Herd’s migrations do get jumpstarted, the renewed proposal will likely encounter political resistance. 
During a recent meeting in Lander, Sen. Laura Pearson, a Republican from Kemmerer, told Game and Fish commissioners she was “on the fence” about moving forward with Sublette Pronghorn Herd migration protections, and expressed worries they could inhibit oil and gas drilling.
Another member of the statehouse who lives on the flanks of the Wyoming Range, Rep. Mike Schmid, was once a champion of migration protections. The former Game and Fish commissioner, a Republican from La Barge, helped shape the state’s policy and urged bold action during those deliberations.  
“There’s no drilling within a half-mile of the centerline of the Oregon Trail, but yet there’s oil and gas wells throughout that country,” Schmid once told state lawmakers. “We leave the Oregon Trail alone, but we still get to the resources underneath. We can do the same with wildlife corridors.”
More recently, however, Schmid has been skeptical about migration protections and he’s pushed the narrative that oil and gas infrastructure benefits migrating big game, even though long-term research on pronghorn and mule deer in the Green River Basin has shown the opposite.

Deborah Ross, left, on Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025. (Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02) and a panel of health care advocates and experts urged the public to help “save health care” on Thursday by calling on elected officials to extend health insurance tax credits and restore Medicaid funding as a government shutdown looms.
The U.S. Senate is set to return on Monday, Sept. 29, to further debate measures to continue funding the government ahead of a looming government shutdown. Democrats are demanding the GOP use the opportunity to reverse cuts to Medicaid and extend the premium tax credit, which helps refund taxpayers’ health care expenses.
During Thursday’s panel, Ross pointed to the failed votes as a cause for hope. She noted that Democrats’ budget resolution garnered two more votes than a Republican proposal, which saw two GOP senators vote against it.
“The Senate had more senators vote to extend the tax credit and protect Medicaid than to let the costs go into effect,” Ross said. “If they hear from their constituents, from the providers about how big a deal this is for people’s individual health insurance, how the tax cuts for billionaires are trickling down to take away health care from everyday Americans — now is our time to let people know what’s really going on.”
Most critical, she said, is making these changes before open enrollment begins, when millions of Americans will select their health coverage for the coming year. “It will be mass confusion and we know who will be to blame for it, and that is the Republicans in Congress,” she said.
If Congress fails to extend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits consumers would see significant premium increases. Should the enhanced subsidies not be renewed, the Congressional Budget Office projects the number of uninsured people nationally will rise by 2.2 million in 2026.
Ross was joined by OB-GYN Jenna Beckham, Medicaid recipient Shannon Dingle, Advance Community Health CEO Scot McCray. The panel was moderated by Vanessa Watson, state director for Protect Our Care North Carolina.










We were praying about it, we were trying to figure out where we could bring things together, and I believe that God answered by providing Medicaid, by providing the waiver program that allows her to live and thrive at home and go to school here in Raleigh.


– Shannon Dingle, whose daughter has cerebral palsy


Dingle, whose teenage daughter has cerebral palsy — requiring full-time care and a wheelchair — said without a Medicaid waiver program, Community Alternatives Program for Children, her daughter would not be able to live with her family.
“We were praying about it, we were trying to figure out where we could bring things together, and I believe that God answered by providing Medicaid, by providing the waiver program that allows her to live and thrive at home and go to school here in Raleigh,” Dingle said.
Her family is currently in the renewal process for the waiver program, something that they will have to complete more frequently under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While “nothing has changed about her needs,” Dingle said, they are asked to provide more documentation, physicians’ notes, and other references to justify her continued support under the program.
“I’m savvy with it and able to know what to do and what I need to provide, but that’s not the case for so many families,” Dingle said. “This is about people who, like my daughter, deserve health care and shouldn’t have to be paying more or going without because they can’t pay the bill.”
The federal debate coincides with a state-level debate over providing additional funding for Medicaid, which has also left lawmakers at an impasse. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is poised to cut reimbursement rates across the board by 3% without additional funding. Part of the state debate is over the final payment installment for a children’s hospital, which the Senate included in its bill but the House did not.
While she acknowledged Thursday’s gathering did not include state lawmakers, Ross said the most important thing is securing Medicaid funding.
“Without Medicaid, we can’t have a children’s hospital. Without full Medicaid, most of those children who are going to be in that children’s hospital are not going to have private insurance,” Ross said. “This isn’t just a negotiation issue, this is a foundational issue.”
Scot McCray, CEO of Advance Community Health, said cuts to Medicaid now will only exacerbate medical costs in the long run in a health care panel on Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025. (Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
That shortfall will only be exacerbated if federal Medicaid cuts remain in place. Should federal contributions fall below a 90% threshold, a “trigger law” would end Medicaid expansion in the state, revoking coverage for roughly 680,000 North Carolinians.
McCray, the Advance Community Health CEO, said in the long run, these cuts will only add costs to the health care system.
“Instead of going to us for a nominal fee of $40 for a comprehensive physical on our slot fee, no difference, $40, that same patient can end up at an [emergency department] on average for $1,200, with no insurance and no cash to pay,” he said. “We’ve done nothing but just add to this cycle of not finding a solution long-term.”
According to Beckham, the OB-GYN, cuts will have an especially damaging impact on rural communities as well as on marginalized groups. Half of births in North Carolina are covered by Medicaid, meaning that reductions in coverage are a “major threat” to those requiring maternity care.
Ross urged North Carolinians with concerns to make their voices heard before the Senate convenes on Sept. 29.
“I’m a big proponent of using your First Amendment right, particularly your right to talk to your members of Congress. We’re home,” Ross said. “Congress is not in session, and it is a perfect opportunity to petition the government for redress of your grievances.”

The university took action halfway through the timeframe set by the Iowa Board of Regents for investigating such cases.
According to a letter dated Sept. 23 and sent to the Iowa Capital Dispatch by ISU spokesperson Angie Hunt, the university notified “financial aid professional” Caitlyn Spencer her employment was terminated as the result of an investigation into violations of the board of regents’ freedom of expression policy. ISU President Wendy Wintersteen signed the letter.
“As a result of the investigation, Iowa State University has determined that your conduct and continued employment has caused, and is reasonably likely to continue to cause, significant disruption, harm, and adverse impact to the efficient and effective operations of the university,” the letter stated.

Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates on Sept. 17 ordered each of the universities the board governs to conduct investigations into alleged violations of board policy relating to free expression, including rules on social media that state employees can express their own views online as long as they don’t violate university policies, like making threats against a coworker.
Any investigations must be wrapped up within two weeks, Bates said during the Sept. 17 board meeting, and university presidents are allowed to take immediate disciplinary action, including job termination.
Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a news conference Wednesday that anyone found through investigation to have celebrated “taking another human life, you know, shutting down free speech” should lose their job, adding that the action “has a chilling effect.”
“Anybody — anybody — that celebrates the execution of a human being is disgusting and unconscionable, and it’s just not acceptable,” Reynolds said. “Political violence should never be accepted, period. Period, end of story.”
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, voiced his support for the termination on the social media site X. He and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, previously called for the firing of any university employee found to have  “celebrated” Kirk’s death online.
Collins pointed to Spencer’s online comments about Kirk’s death as one example of university employees who have “celebrated the death of their fellow American,” the letter stated. According to information provided by Collins, Spencer’s post stated that Kirk “got was coming” and that she was “happy he’s rotting in hell now.”
“Assassination culture will not be tolerated on Iowa’s college campuses,” Collins said in his post. “Other university employees who advocate for violence against those of differing political views will be dealt with accordingly.”
The University of Northern Iowa directed questions about potential employee investigations to the Iowa Board of Regents, and board spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email he has no additional information to provide.
University of Iowa public relations manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email personnel actions are considered confidential.
The board of regents also received an update at last week’s meeting on investigations into University of Iowa employees who allegedly spoke on video about trying to work around anti-diversity, equity and inclusion laws put in place by the Iowa Legislature.
Both the UI and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird stated they would be opening investigations into videos aired on Fox News showing Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development discussing how she still completes DEI work despite the terms being removed online, and another UI employee talking on the same  topic.
Regent David Barker asked UI President Barbara Wilson about the investigations during the meeting; she directed the questions to Board Counsel Aimee Claeys. Claeys said board staff is working with Iowa Solicitor General Eric Wessan and the Attorney General’s Office on the investigation, as well as outside law firm Consovoy McCarthy, on a two-phase review into the videos themselves and overall compliance with state and federal law.
The first phase of the investigation involves reviewing the videos in question to determine whether employees have violated institutional or board policies, Claeys said, and the second phase will focus on supplementing past work to “determine and ensure a broader compliance” with state and federal civil rights laws.
According to reporting from the Cedar Rapids Gazette, a contract between the board and Consovoy McCarthy commits to paying the firm $700,000 in three phases.
“That work is just commencing, we are in the document and record gathering phase, but I meet every other week with Consovoy and Solicitor General Wesson to make sure that we are on track, on task, on budget, and that the expectations of the Board of Regents, the universities and the attorney generals are being met.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday it is suing six states — California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania — that have refused to turn over detailed voter roll data demanded by federal attorneys earlier this year.
The Justice Department has reached out to more than half the states in recent months for voter lists, and has indicated it plans to contact all of them. Some of the requests vary in detail, but in general they ask for voter information on millions of Americans, including personal data such as driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
Some states have released only publicly available data or invited DOJ attorneys to make public records requests. Others have refused outright. Indiana last week became the first known state to have provided sensitive personal data.
Under the Constitution, states are responsible for administering elections, and some state election officials have said they are barred by state law from handing over the information the Justice Department has demanded. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security this month confirmed it had received data from the Justice Department and would use it unearth “illegal aliens.”
The Trump administration also is developing a powerful data tool that it says will help states prevent noncitizens from voting, which is extremely rare.
The lawsuits have been filed in the federal districts of the respective states. They argue that the federal government is privy to the data under two federal laws, the Help Americans Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), that were passed “to ensure that states have proper and effective voter registration and voter list maintenance programs,” the Justice Department said in a news release.
“Clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement announcing the lawsuits. “Every state has a responsibility to ensure that voter registration records are accurate, accessible, and secure — states that don’t fulfill that obligation will see this Department of Justice in court.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Thursday plans to boost American farmers by purchasing millions of bushels of crops.
In an effort to increase American exports, the USDA will purchase 417,000 metric tons of commodities immediately to support the international food aid programs. That’s equivalent to more than 16 million bushels of corn and sorghum.
Rollins made the announcement during a speech that earned a standing ovation at the Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, Missouri, where she outlined the Trump Administration’s efforts to aid a struggling farm economy.
“The cost of doing business for our farmers has increased drastically while commodity prices have slipped,” Rollins said.
The large purchase would benefit America First International Food Assistance programs, the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program and Food for Progress, which rely on U.S.-grown crops.
Rollins outlined a series of dire economic challenges facing farmers and ranchers in the United States, blaming the Biden administration for inflation and policies that “all but ignored the needs” of farmers.
Since 2020, the cost of seed has risen 18%, the cost of fuel rose 30%, labor costs are up 47%, electricity up 36%, machinery up 45% and fertilizer up 37%, she said. Largest of all was a 73% increase in interest expenses.
To address rising costs for farmers, Rollins said the Federal Reserve needs to keep lowering interest rates. The Trump administration is also reportedly repurposing “Biden DEI,” or diversity, equity and inclusion funds. Those could benefit farmers as soon as Oct. 2.
She touted seven new international trade deals, including 99% tariffs on Indonesia, increased rice exports from Japan and an ethanol deal with the United Kingdom.
Out of concern for undue foreign influence in American agriculture, Rollins also announced that the USDA and the U.S. Department of Justice signed a joint memorandum Thursday morning to scrutinize the agriculture marketplace through antitrust enforcement that promotes market competition, effective immediately.
Rollins addressed a pressing beef cattle shortage, which partially has to do with low inventory, a loss of cattle ranches and disease risk. Over the past decade, the U.S. has lost about 150,000 cattle operations, Rollins said. Many have been offshored or consolidated. U.S. cattle inventory is at its lowest in 75 years, she said.
She also promised new dietary guidelines for Americans that encourage beef, protein and whole milk consumption.
However, the USDA has no current plans to offer payments to beef producers.
“We see how the government getting involved can completely distort the markets, and so currently there will be no plan,” Rollins said. “No plan is even under consideration to insert ourselves through payments into the beef cattle industry.”
Instead, Rollins said, the government will focus on freeing up land, using funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill for animal disease prevention, and, “hopefully inspiring the next generation of farmers.”
She told reporters following the speech that the USDA is not yet ready to announce a payment plan to aid farmers. During the first Trump administration, farmers received around $23 million in subsidies.
Also on Thursday, President Donald Trump told reporters he would use tariff revenue to bail out farmers, who have been disproportionately hurt by tariff policies, according to reporting from Politico.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rollins-4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-25 18:57:55.102094

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Democrats said the impacts of President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation law – alongside agriculture economy troubles caused by trade wars – puts the state budget in a dangerous position as the state implements income tax cuts.
The budget reconciliation bill signed into law by Trump in July included changes to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that Iowa adopted, as the state has rolling conformity with the IRC.
The changes made in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to individual and corporate income taxes – including the changes to taxes on tips and overtime – as well as franchise taxes will result in an estimated $437.5 million decrease for Iowa’s general fund revenues in fiscal year 2026, according to initial projections from the Iowa Department of Revenue. The federal law will also cause a projected $348.4 million reduction in FY 2027 revenues.

Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a news conference Wednesday it was important Congress passed the budget reconciliation package – “because otherwise it would have been a tremendous tax increase on hard-working Iowans” – but said the changes will have an impact on Iowa’s state budget and general fund.
Additionally, Reynolds said the state of U.S. agricultural trade will also have a major influence on Iowa’s economy. As Trump has pursued renegotiating trade deals and implementing tariffs for many countries, some farmers have expressed concerns about the impact on agricultural exports. This has been an especially large concern for soybean farmers, as China is currently not buying U.S. soybeans because of tariffs imposed by Trump. China typically buys more than half of the crop grown in the U.S. each year.
Though Reynolds acknowledged the impact of these trade negotiations, she said she supported Trump’s trade agenda and called for expanding into new international markets.
“The ag economy is really impacting our economy,” Reynolds said. “Our largest sector by GDP is advanced manufacturing — it’s directly tied to ag. And in the four years of the Biden administration, they did absolutely nothing (with agriculture trade negotiations), absolutely nothing. And our farmers are good at what they do, 10% of the nation’s food supply is produced by our farm families, and so we continue to have higher yields, and we need to find markets. And the Trump administration is working every day on trade deals that will do just that.”
When the state Revenue Estimating Conference (REC) last met in March, before the federal changes were implemented, the panel estimated Iowa would see a drop of $621 million, or 6.4%, in tax receipts in FY 2026, and a revenue decrease of $626.7 million, or 6.9%, when compared to FY 2025.
The REC estimates guided the budgeting process for Reynolds and state lawmakers this year. The approved $9.425 billion budget accounted for the state’s estimated $8.5 billion in projected revenue, in addition to drawing an estimated $917 million in funding from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and budget surplus.
Reynolds and Republican lawmakers said heading into 2025, they were preparing to spend money from these reserves after they approved speeding up individual and corporate income tax cuts in 2024.
Democrats have criticized Republicans, who have a trifecta of control at the Iowa Statehouse, for drawing on one-time funds in the state’s reserves and Taxpayer Relief Fund to implement income tax cuts.
In an interview Thursday, House Minority Leader Brian Meyer said the recent projected impacts of the budget reconciliation bill and agriculture economy will add to the “fiscal death spiral” Iowa is facing. He said the reserve funds will run out in roughly three years, and that without changes to Iowa’s budgeting practices, “a lot of important programs are going to have to be cut.”
He said the reserve funds are a “Band-aid” for the state to address the impacts of recent tax cuts, but that major changes need to occur in the state’s budgeting practices in order to avoid major problems in the coming years.
“That’s all they’re doing, is putting a Band-aid on a structural deficit, a structural problem in the state of Iowa that is the Republicans’ tax cuts and the trade wars,” Meyer said. “And once you pass that, in two to three years, you’re done. There’s no money.”
Meyer said he believes getting rid of Iowa’s Education Savings Account program — the public funding mechanism for K-12 private school tuition and costs — as well as reversing “tax cuts for millionaires on the state level” made through recent income tax changes would put Iowa in a better financial position moving forward.
“If we get rid of vouchers, if we get rid of those tax cuts for millionaires on the state level, all of a sudden, the budget is somewhat in a better shape,” Meyer said. “Then, you go to the national level, and you push back on Donald Trump and  Republicans in the Congress and you say, ‘These tariffs are destroying Iowa’s economy.'”
Speaking Wednesday, Reynolds said the state’s funding reserves, alongside the conservative budgeting practices she and GOP leaders in the state Legislature have maintained, has put the state in a sound position to deal with some of the economic pressures.
“We’re in a good position to weather some of the ag (economy changes) and some of the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Reynolds said. “… A lot of states are not that position.”
According to a report from Truth in Accounting, a public finance transparency nonprofit, 25 states could not cover all their financial obligations at the end of FY 2024. Iowa was one of the 25 states with a surplus of funds relative to their total costs and debts.
The next REC meeting is set for Oct. 16 at the Iowa State Capitol. Reynolds also said her office has begun the budgeting process for the next fiscal year.
“As we go through the budget process, which we’ve started on … we’re going to keep spending in check, just like I’ve done for the last six years,” Reynolds said.

Tuttle Courthouse in downtown Atlanta, home of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. (Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A Florida man who screamed racial slurs at a Black military officer while attempting to drive him off the road was rightfully sentenced, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
It was an “easy” decision to deny defendant Jordan Leahy’s request to strike down a Civil Rights-era federal law protecting Americans from abuse because of their race, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit’s three-judge panel decided. 
They agreed with a U.S. district court that convicted Leahy in 2022 of willfully intimidating and interfering with a Black man, identified as J.T., and attempting to injure, intimidate and interfere with J.T. through the use of a dangerous weapon because he is Black and was traveling on a public roadway.
“We must consider whether Congress rationally determined that violent interference with the use of a public road because of race constitutes a badge or incident of slavery,” wrote Judge Robin Rosenbaum in the majority opinion. 
“This is an easy one. We hold that Congress did.”
Rosenbaum, an Obama appointee, referred to the 1968 law making it a federal crime for anyone purposely attempting to harm someone enjoying state or locally-run facilities because of their race. The statute grew from the 13th Amendment’s provision allowing Congress to make laws to enforce the amendment, which banned slavery.
Leahy, who is white, claimed the law was unconstitutional because Congress “exceeded” its power. One of his arguments cited mid-Civil War cases referencing a “master’s will” that paved the path for the Jim Crow era. 
“Leahy’s proposed alternative is a doctrinal framework that is a relic of Jim Crow, and … would dramatically shrink the authority the Framers gave to Congress,” Rosenbaum wrote.
What happened?
Around 10 p.m. on a Sunday night in August 2021, J.T., a Black man who worked as a military training officer, a personal trainer and a fight coach, was driving his girlfriend and four-year-old daughter from a Palm Harbor birthday dinner to his girlfriend’s apartment in Seminole. 
That’s when Leahy, then 28, pulled onto the near-empty Starkey Road and began “incessantly screaming” racial slurs at J.T., the opinion says. He chased J.T.’s car, repeatedly trying to run him off the road, before finally sideswiping the passenger side of his car. Leahy then pulled in front of J.T., where he stopped at a red light.
This is when J.T. attempted to take a photo of Leahy’s license plate to call the police, when Leahy exited the car and began to approach J.T.
“J.T. realized that Leahy was coming after him. Concerned for the safety of his daughter and girlfriend, J.T. got out of his car to draw Leahy and any guns he might be carrying away from them,” the court opinion reads. “He told his girlfriend to lock the doors and call the police.”
Leahy began “swinging” at J.T., who dodged the attacks, hit the defendant twice, then put Leahy in a chokehold, knocking him out. Court documents say that Leahy, smelling of alcohol, woke up once to vomit. 
Leahy told police officers that J.T. was the one who attacked him for “no reason,” and launched a string of racist remarks.
“[T]hese guys [Black people] are animals, you know what I’m saying? Y’all have to maintain these people, keep them in their — in their areas,” he said, claiming he was the victim of a hate crime because he’s white. 
Once he realized police didn’t believe him, Leahy said: “That’s crazy. Man that, what happened to America bro? Y’all let the f— mother f— from the ghetto beat up on the white suburban kid.” 
Officers arrested Leahy at the scene.
In November 2022, he was sentenced in the Middle District of Florida to 24 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Tension is growing between two legacy Louisiana industries – seafood and fossil fuels – in Southwest Louisiana, where local fishermen are clashing with the operator of a massive liquified natural gas export facility. 
Those who make their living harvesting fresh oysters, fish and crabs from Calcasieu Lake and the surrounding marsh waterways say Venture Global’s liquified natural gas terminal continues to disrupt and damage the estuary. They want state and federal regulators to hold the company accountable for improperly dispersing dredged sediment from a new ship channel it’s creating. 
“It’s been a month since we first told them what was going on,” said James Hiatt, director of the local environmental advocacy group For a Better Bayou. “They haven’t stopped screwing up.”`
Venture Global is dredging near its terminal to make way for the massive tankers that transport liquified natural gas to its global customers. Its sprawling export facility on Calcasieu Pass is known as CP1, and it plans an expansion site, CP2, nearby. 
Venture Global is allowed to move sediment from nearby Monkey Island and the existing ship channel into Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, according to its permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The refuge borders the southwest section of Calcasieu Lake, just a few miles from the LNG terminal.
The dredged mud is supposed to be placed within marsh creation projects around the refuge, but eyewitnesses and officials confirm the material has spilled outside those areas, creating issues for local fishermen. 
Federal law says dredged or fill material cannot be dumped into a navigable body of water — such as Calcasieu Lake — without permission from the Corps of Engineers. When state or federal permits are breached, regulators are allowed to seek a wide variety of enforcement actions, such as cleanup or fines.

Eddie Lejuine of Hackberry, who uses trotlines to fish for red drum among the oyster reefs and marshes around Calcasieu Lake, said he saw silty water pouring into the lake from a flood control weir on the night of Aug. 3. 
“The next morning, I noticed my lines had a lot of silt on them, dirt on them,” Lejeuine said. 
Nearby oyster beds, where red drum frequently swim, and crab traps were buried in the same mud, he said. 
“I use like 60 pounds of crab claws for bait every day, and I fish on top of oyster beds during the summer. So my living relies on oysters growing and crabs,” Lejuine said. 
Sky Leger from Cameron Parish said dredged materials inundated the floating oyster cages he harvests with other fisherman, killing some of their crop.
Fishermen who have lost their catch as a result of the mud are frustrated with Venture Global. 

Leger said he and others who work the waters must strictly follow state Wildlife and Fisheries regulations, but feel Venture Global has not faced the same level of accountability.  
“It was kind of just looked over, which kind of makes me mad because every time something happens with the game warden … we gotta abide,” he said. 
Venture Global did not respond to the Illuminator’s calls and emails for this report, but it has publicly acknowledged the early August spill. 
The company initially denied it had anything to do with the spill in early August but later acknowledged its role, according to an Aug. 9 KPLC-TV report. The issue still merited discussion at a Sept. 2 Cameron Parish Police Jury meeting, when representatives from Venture Global acknowledged that about 15,000 cubic yards of dredge material had spread beyond permitted areas in early August. 
A Venture Global representative said more containment booms were placed next to the weir three days after the spill to fix the problem. No further mud has spilled into Calcasieu Lake, and no other materials have ended up outside permitted areas despite claims to the contrary from local fishermen, according to the company. 
“In future endeavors, and especially with dredging jobs … I would like to see us crack down a little bit,” Cameron Police Juror Mark Daigle at the meeting. 
During the same meeting, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries confirmed the early August spill had spread into the lake, validating fishermen’s claims of smothered oyster beds and crab traps.
“They didn’t want to put no blame on Venture Global because it was just our word,” Lejuine said. “But once Wildlife and Fisheries announced it, then you know – no matter what [Venture Global] said – they for sure knew there was an issue at that point.”
Venture Global representatives at the meeting said the company wanted to meet with fishermen and come up with a way to help the problems the spilled sediment caused. 
Lejuine and Leger said they participated in one-on-one meetings with Venture Global in the days following the police jury meeting to discuss solutions. The company gave fishermen a chance to talk, Lejuine said, but he isn’t sure all their problems will be immediately apparent. 
“The parts that leaked into the lake, the oysters are probably dead by now because it went over, silted over. But we won’t know the impact ‘til oyster season opens,” he said.

Documents available online from the Department of Energy and Natural Resources indicate state officials and the Corps of Engineers were “aware of this incident” from early August. 
The state issued an emergency permit for the Cameron Parish Port and Venture Global to pick up “to the best extent practicable” and return the spilled silt to its permitted area. The permit indicates between 9,000 to 18,000 cubic yards of silt spilled into the lake and marsh. 
The environmental organization EarthJustice got involved after the spill, sending a letter to the Corps of Engineers and Natural Resources. It pressed the agencies again in emails when fishermen and advocates claimed to see more muddy water spilling over containment berms into the lake and refuge wetlands toward the end of August. 
State and corps officials said Venture Global reported no knowledge of any additional dredge spills. 
Evidence of more alleged mud spills has popped up on videos advocacy groups have posted on social media in recent weeks. For a Better Bayou shared footage of a spill taken Sept. 8 in the Cameron Ship Channel. A Sept. 10 video the Habitat Recovery Project shared shows a geyser of mud shooting from a pipe that transports dredge material to a permitted area. 
A joint connecting two pipes failed under excessive pressure on Sept. 10, shooting muddy water into the air, according to the Cameron Parish Sheriff’s Office, which said the break was repaired the next day.   
Both groups said fishermen shot the videos but did not disclose their names. It is unclear whether either spill allowed mud to flow into unpermitted areas.
Lejuine said that, despite the lack of communication from the company and regulators so far, he believes there’s still hope in the fisherman’s collective voice. Fishermen will continue to be vigilant when it comes to reporting any additional spills, he said.
“It is at a breaking point, what I do for a living. I don’t know how it lasted this long, it’s by God’s grace that we’ve managed,” he said. “At least we, the fishermen, are finally speaking up and doing things.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9234-scaled-e1758837798927.jpg,,,2025-09-25 18:57:55.102094

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will once again pause abortion services at its clinics next week after an injunction that blocked portions of President Donald Trump’s megabill was lifted.
Three Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin clinics in Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan currently offer abortion services and are together the largest provider for abortion services in the state. 
The temporary pause in services will take effect on Oct. 1. Until then, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin says that it is working to see as many patients as possible and continuing to monitor the legal landscape. 
“Our commitment is unwavering: Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care — including abortion — as soon and as we are able to,” Tanya Atkinson, president of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement. “In the meantime, we are pursuing every available option — through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.” 
“To the patients who count on us: we are here for you. To our staff and supporters: thank you for standing with us. We remain dedicated to care — no matter what,” Atkinson said. 
The organization is halting services due the federal tax cut and spending megabill — officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act — signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. 
Federal funds have been prohibited from being used to pay for most abortion care for nearly five decades under the Hyde Amendment. However, Planned Parenthood has been able to use federal funds via Medicaid payments and Title X, a federally funded family planning program, to help provide services other than abortion care, including contraceptive care, STI testing, pregnancy testing, and gynecological services to low-income and uninsured individuals. 
The new law includes a provision, which is set to expire July 4, 2026, that bars Medicaid payments for one year for organizations that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023 and primarily engage in family planning services and reproductive health and provide abortions. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin noted that the law was crafted specifically to penalize Planned Parenthood and its patients.
The law is being challenged in court, but an injunction that was blocking the law from taking effect was lifted earlier this month by the First District Court of Appeals.
According to the UW-Madison’s Collaborative for Reproductive Equity (CORE), after October 1, clinic-based abortion care in Wisconsin will only be available at two independent clinics in Milwaukee.
“Effectively, 99% of Wisconsin counties now lack clinic-based abortion care,” the organization said in an email.
This is the second time that abortion services will disappear from the state since Roe v. Wade was overturned.
After the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs decision, abortion care in Wisconsin halted for about 15 months from June 2022 until September 2023, when Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin determined it had enough legal standing to resume. 
Abortion had been halted in Wisconsin due to a criminal law enacted in 1849, but that was ruled invalid and unenforceable by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July. The Court found in its 4-3 decision that the law had effectively been repealed by other laws passed after it. 
A coalition of Illinois abortion providers and advocates said at a press conference in Chicago Thursday morning that they were prepared to take Wisconsin residents who need abortion services. 
Dr. Allison Cowett, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer for Family Planning Associates, which is the largest independent abortion provider in Illinois, said the agency saw a significant jump in patients the last time abortion services were restricted in Wisconsin.
“Before Dobbs, less than 3% of our patients traveled to Illinois from Wisconsin for an abortion. When Wisconsin’s 1849 trigger ban went into effect, that number jumped to 9%,” Cowett said. “One in every 12 patients we cared for here in this building came from Wisconsin. After 15 months of that ban, abortion services in Wisconsin were restored, and that number dropped in half.”
She expects the previous increase to be repeated.  
“With the sharp reduction in abortion access expected in Wisconsin in less than a week, we anticipate a large influx of patients, once again, forced to travel to Illinois for this basic health care,” Cowett said.
Megan Jeyifo, executive director of the Chicago Abortion Fund, said the pause in services amounts to a ban and Illinois is prepared to once again take in patients. 
“Illinois is ready. Our constellation of care, which includes providers, funds, advocates, and our incredible elected officials will not leave people stranded,” Jeyifo said. “We will not abandon people when they need us. We will be here with open arms to support the needs of our neighbors. Abortion is not just a procedure or a few pills. Abortion gives women and girls and trans and non-binary people control of our lives, our families and our futures.”
Wisconsin Democrats were critical of Trump’s law for how it is affecting access and recommended that people continue to reach out to Planned Parenthood if they need care.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) told reporters after a discussion with people affected by Trump administration changes to the Affordable Care Act in Mount Horeb that Planned Parenthood’s announcement is just one of the health care impacts from Trump’s “big, ugly bill.”
“Planned Parenthood does incredible things for people’s health, cancer screenings, wellness checkups, full range of reproductive care, and this is obviously already having impacts on the type of care that Wisconsinites will be able to receive, and it’s a tragic result,” Baldwin said. 
State Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and state Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said in a joint statement that “the Trump administration and Republican extremists are focused on targeting access to reproductive health care.” 
“Planned Parenthood’s announcement that it is pausing abortion services is the latest example of the devastating effects of Trump’s Big, Ugly Bill. Wisconsinites will continue to have their lives upended and their wellbeing threatened by that piece of legislation,” the lawmakers said. “It is important to note that abortion is and remains legal in the State of Wisconsin. Those who need that health care should continue to contact Planned Parenthood for help in finding access to those services or reach out to other providers who offer abortion services.”
Wisconsin Right to Life, an anti-abortion advocacy organization, celebrated the pause in services in a statement. 
“Taxpayer dollars should never fund the taking of innocent preborn lives,” Executive Director Heather Weininger said, claiming that Planned Parenthood has “long centered its operations around abortion services, and this announcement only confirms that reality.” 
According to Planned Parenthood’s annual report from 2022-23, abortion services accounted for  4% of all the health services the organization provided.
“Women and girls facing difficult or unexpected pregnancies deserve compassion, real support, and life-affirming care — and that’s exactly what the pro-life movement is committed to providing,” Weininger said.

Health officials are urging Vermonters to protect themselves from mosquito bites, warning that Eastern equine encephalitis, while rare, can be serious and deadly to humans.

The Eastern equine encephalitis virus has recently returned to Vermont, with mosquitoes in Orleans, Addison and Franklin counties testing positive for the virus. 
Health officials are urging Vermonters to protect themselves from mosquito bites, warning the virus — while rare — can be serious and deadly to humans. Last year, one Chittenden County man in his 70s died of the virus in one of two cases of serious illness in the state. 
This month, mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in Swanton and Vergeness, and a horse in Brownington is also suspected of carrying the virus. 
The Vermont Department of Health strongly encouraged Vermonters to take measures to prevent mosquito bites. Officials encouraged people to wear long-sleeve shirts and pants outdoors, use bug repellant that’s effective against mosquitoes, avoid leaving standing water and limit time outside around dawn and dusk. 
Mosquitoes may be more likely to carry the virus in areas where it’s been detected, said Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian. 
From June through October, technicians with the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets venture out to about 110 surveillance sites around the state, where they trap mosquitoes for testing, according to Patti Casey, who oversees environmental surveillance for the agency. 
Scientists with the agency currently monitor the West Nile virus, the Jamestown Canyon virus and the Eastern equine encephalitis virus. It’s the first summer state scientists have tested for the Jamestown virus, with the first human case of the virus in Vermont confirmed earlier this month. 
While it’s rare, people who do experience serious illness from EEE suffer from symptoms like fever, headache, vomiting or body aches. “The risk is low because most people don’t tend to get sick, but among those who do, it could be very dangerous,” Kwit said. 
Among those with symptoms, only 5% get seriously ill, Kwit said. But one-third of people who experience serious symptoms die, she said. 
Last year’s EEE surge was the first time scientists saw an uptick in the virus in Vermont since 2012, Kwit said. Then, alerts from health officials prompted organizers in Vermont’s Queen City to cancel a number of outdoor events or move them inside. 
The virus typically comes to the Northeast in 8-to-10-year cycles, often ramping up for several years at a time, Casey said. 
Scientists believe that pattern happens because the virus “amplifies” in an exchange between mosquitoes and bird populations — and birds’ migration patterns bring the virus across the country, Casey said. 
Primary vector mosquitoes feed almost exclusively on bird populations. They transmit the disease among birds until many mosquitoes and birds are carrying the virus, Casey said. Then, bridge vector mosquitoes, which feed on birds and other animals, transfer the virus beyond birds — notably to humans and horses, Casey said. 
Horses cannot transfer the virus to humans and are recommended to be annually vaccinated for the virus, Casey said. Horses who are sick with the virus tend to suffer neurological symptoms, like falling over and stumbling, she said. 
This month, one horse in Brownington is suspected to have had the virus, but tests weren’t able to explicitly confirm it was infected, Casey said. 
Kwit said no vaccine exists for humans, and there’s no approved treatment for people with symptoms. To protect themselves, people should follow recommendations from health officials, she said.

(Image courtesy of Rhode Island Department of State)Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore’s quest to find the right locale to host the Rhode Island State Archives plus other state treasures and artifacts might be compared to the story of Goldilocks.
The Archives’ current home, a leased space on 33 Broad St., Providence, is too small to suit the grand purposes Amore has in mind for the state’s material history. But Amore’s proposal in early 2024 to build a new state archives and history center across the street from the State House proved much too big in scope and cost — its price tag was $102 million — to win over legislators, though it did have the support of Gov. Dan McKee.  
What may be just right is Amore’s new approach: a downsized Rhode Island State History Center, still on Smith Hill, which would function more like an exhibition and multipurpose event space than a comprehensive monument to the state’s past. The secretary’s refreshed schematic seeks to “right-size the building and to reduce the project cost,” Amore wrote in his Aug. 8 cover letter for a capital budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget. 
“The most essential public functions of the previous program remain, including an exhibit gallery for permanent display of Rhode Island’s founding documents, as well as space for rotating exhibits,” Amore wrote.
The capital budget ask comprises a total of $60.8 million for fiscal years 2027 through 2031, including funding for revamping the Open Government Center website. Amore’s suggested rebrand relies on the results of the $500,000 feasibility study by LLB Architects commissioned by the Department of State with Rhode Island Capital Plan (RICAP) funds allocated in fiscal year 2025. 
“In the Department of State’s budget negotiations, it was clear the project scope exceeded available State support,” the state department’s new capital budget request says the failed 2024 archives building proposal.
The first half of Amore’s compromise is laid out as the Rhode Island State History Center, a two-story museum, preferably still on Smith Hill. The second half involves porting the bulk of the State Archives, including its stacks and public reading room, to the Robert L. Carothers Library & Learning Common at the University of Rhode Island (URI) in Kingston.

Rather than rely on a bond issue to secure a new home for the archives — as proposed in 2024 — the new capital request suggests $45 million for the history center and another $15 million for the URI buildout. Another potential site for the museum on State Street could work, the feasibility study noted. But this arrangement would erase 126 parking spaces, which the budget request calls “a significant drawback” as a new parking lot would need to be built nearby anyway, an add-on which could raise the total project cost to $62.64 million.
“The estimated total project cost for the parking garage is $17,054,311,” the document reads. “But, the feasibility of the parking garage project is uncertain — the prospective site is also being evaluated for a solar canopy installation.”
Wherever the museum may end up landing, it would display state treasures — including the Royal Charter, Act of Renunciation, and Rhode Island copies of the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights — and feature rotating exhibits plus a multipurpose event space, public amenities, and a gift shop on the first floor.
“The exhibit spaces and limited records collection storage proposed for the Rhode Island State History Center would house the highest value documents and objects currently at the State Archives,” the proposal reads. “These items in our collection are permanent and irreplaceable.”
The second floor would have a limited amount of record storage, as well as the Secretary of State’s executive office, moving it from its current location at the State House. Overall, the project cuts the original proposal from around 52,700 gross square feet to about 24,600 gross square feet.

As for the URI space, it would consolidate the existing State Archives (minus what would be stored at the History Center) plus off-site holdings at Iron Mountain, one of the world’s largest document and record-storage companies which holds a number of Rhode Island archival materials. The budget request notes that URI is also working with LLB Architects to determine feasibility for these upgrades.
“The Department believes there is a natural synergy for the collections storage and research functions of the State Archives program to be housed at the University of Rhode Island and to have a State-affiliated agency as a long-term partner, instead of a commercial landlord,” the budget request reads.
The Broad Street archives space is in a building owned by Paolino Properties, the company owned by former Providence mayor and noted developer in the city, Joseph Paolino Jr.
The feasibility study recommended a project director be hired to steer to development and design. That would be followed by 14 months of design, three months of bidding, 16 months of construction, and three months of installation and moving in. If the project kicked off in 2027, and proceeded on the timeline suggested, the museum could open sometime in 2030, the study estimated. But it also adjusted project cost estimates for inflation and cautioned that construction costs could rise in summer 2029, which would be the midpoint of the project.
Amore’s capital request attaches an additional ask for $800,000 to revamp the state’s OpenGov portal, which hosts state directories of public officials, open meetings, municipal and state boards and commission, and other civic and government information.
“It is also essential to meeting my goals of encouraging civic engagement by providing an accurate, user-friendly tool for Rhode Islanders to learn about and engage with their government,” Amore wrote in his cover letter.
In 2024, Amore requested $750,000 for the same upgrades when he presented his wish list to the House Committee on Finance as part of its annual budget-refining process.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
People living around the New Mexico State Fair grounds in the heart of Albuquerque should start imagining the 236-acre state-owned site, now mostly covered in asphalt and concrete and surrounded with tall stucco walls, with open green space, an inviting entrance, a park and a pond. 
Those stood among the common elements of early design concepts for the site during a presentation by design firm Stantec Thursday to a newly created state board that the Legislature endowed with up to $500 million in bonding capacity for a fairgrounds redevelopment project. 
Legislative leaders and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham touted the creation of the new district board as a way to convert the site where the State Fair currently happens once a year into a year-round income generator or site for mixed-income housing. In a statement after Senate Bill 481 was passed, the governor said redevelopment could provide “badly needed new housing for the workforce, while spurring massive private investment.”
Stantec officials , who are drafting a master plan, stressed that no design decisions have been made — particularly whether to move the State Fair from its home for more than 80 years — but they called on the public to imagine a transformation at the fairgrounds. It’s one that could be the impetus for change at the International District.
Potential relocation looms large over NM State Fair opening day

The area surrounding the fairgrounds has some of the deadliest intersections for pedestrians in New Mexico, and a recent Albuquerque police presentation detailed its high crime rates. It’s also a food desert, thanks in part to recent closures of a nearby CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, and a “heat island,” due to the lack of tree canopy and green space. The Trust for Public Lands also rates it as one of Albuquerque areas with the highest need for a public park. 
Nonetheless, the proposed redevelopment has proven controversial with some neighbors who told Source New Mexico that they are concerned the funding will do little to help the neighborhood, will uproot the historic annual State Fair and will, like past efforts at fairgrounds redevelopment, be a flop. According to the Albuquerque Journal, many voiced their concerns about the project at a meeting Stantec held Monday. 
Stantec designer Nancy Locke also released the results of a recent neighborhood survey, which found that nearby neighbors most want “safe, welcoming neighborhoods;” “economic prosperity for neighborhood residents;” and “public health and social services.” 
Instead of the current layout of the fairgrounds, which is 93% pavement, Locke listed off possibilities for the master plan, including designs for “livable density, incorporating agriculture, farming, youth programs, commercial areas that act as like a third place” as well as “open space, bike paths” and other transportation solutions that “get people out of their cars and get people walking.” 
Given how closed off the fairgrounds are from Central Avenue and the International District neighborhoods just beyond them, Locke said the firm thinks it’s important to establish a greater connection between the grounds and the neighborhood, as well as establish a large green space that could be used for multiple purposes.

“It ideally wears multiple hats,” she said of the new Central Avenue connection. “It serves multiple needs, and it will be driven, really, by what we’re hearing from the community going forward.”
Now that it is wrapping up its “analysis” phase, which includes market analysis and public engagement, the firm is moving toward its “master plan development phase,” Locke said. Options abound, she said. 
“There’s a whole range of opportunities that we can start to imagine and start to lay the base for,” she said Thursday. 
The board on Thursday also approved spending up to $22.5 million to acquire an eight-acre area on the southeast corner of the fairgrounds, which currently has about 17 parcels and 13 condominium units. Doing so is a necessary step as the board seeks approval for future spending, according to former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez, who is spearheading the project on behalf of Lujan Grisham.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0894-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 17:57:13.258819

The order updated that number to 170 million.The app was shut down for about 24 hours in January, before Trump suspended enforcement of the law on his first day in office. He has extended that delay several times, most recently last week when he reset the deadline for December. Thursday’s order extends the pause on enforcement of the law into January.Lawmakers across the aisle have expressed concern that China’s ruling Communist Party could access TikTok user data and manipulate what type of content users see. “This deal really does mean that Americans can use TikTok, but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past, because their data is going to be secure and it's not going to be used as a propaganda weapon against our fellow citizens,” Vance said Thursday.Republicans in Congress want protectionsOthers, also across party lines, have argued that free-speech principles should mean the government cannot shut down a private speech platform. And TikTok has argued that it is a U.S.- and Singapore-based company. The app is not even available in mainland China, where the government exerts considerable control over speech, CEO Shou Zi Chew told the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2023.A trio of senior Republicans on that committee — Chairman Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Richard Hudson of North Carolina — said in a Thursday statement the deal was a positive step.“As the details are finalized, we must ensure this deal protects American users from the influence and surveillance of CCP-aligned groups,” they wrote. “Limiting the influence and involvement of China remains a vital national security interest, and we look forward to seeing a deal that secures America’s interests on the global stage.”",,,,2025-09-25 18:57:55.102094

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) prepares for major service cuts, State Police are investigating a crash involving a bus route that will soon cease part of its weekday service.
A route 14 bus flipped on its side in Jamestown at the end of the Pell Bridge on Thursday afternoon, sending three people to the hospital with minor injuries.
The crash was reported at 12:10 p.m. on Route 138 West near the E-ZPass plaza and Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) offices. A preliminary investigation found the left side of the bus struck a guardrail, causing it to cross the other westbound travel lanes and hit a light pole and the guardrail on the right shoulder, coming to rest on its left side in a parking lot behind RITBA’s offices.

Four people were on the bus, State Police Lt. Col. Robert Creamer confirmed in an email. Three of them, including the bus driver, were taken to Newport Hospital with minor injuries. One rider declined medical attention at the scene.
RIPTA spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in an email that the agency deferred questions to the State Police. The bus had a capacity of 36 seats.
Sweeping service reductions are set to take effect Saturday across RIPTA’s network as a cost-cutting measure meant to avert bus driver layoffs due to a multimillion dollar budget shortfall. Service reductions include cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 of its 67 lines — primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours.
The 14 line connects Newport and Narragansett to Providence via the West Bay. Starting Saturday, weekday service between Routes 1A and 138 in North Kingstown and Salt Pond Plaza in Narragansett will be completely eliminated. Buses on the 14 line would still operate on weekends.
RITBA, the quasi-governmental agency responsible for overseeing the Pell Bridge, first closed the right lane of the westbound section of the highway at 1:08 p.m., according to a post on social media. Westbound traffic was fully shut down at 1:47 p.m. Both lanes reopened by 2:45 p.m.

Mike Kehoe, center, speaks to reporters Thursday during a visit to Columbia Regional Airport. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The courts will determine if the bill revising Missouri’s congressional districts is constitutional, Gov. Mike Kehoe said Thursday after announcing his plans to sign the measure this weekend.
Speaking to reporters after an event in Columbia, Kehoe said he felt confident he was on firm legal ground when he called lawmakers into a special session.
“We’ll let the courts decide that,” Kehoe said. “We wouldn’t have went into this without feeling like we had good advice on that.”
Over 10 days this month, lawmakers met and passed a revised map for Missouri’s eight congressional districts so Republicans could have an advantage in the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. 
“Missouri’s conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government, and the Missouri First Map delivers just that,” Kehoe said in a news release announcing he would sign the bill on Sunday.
Even before the special session began, legal challenges were being filed. The NAACP has a case argued Sept. 15 challenging Kehoe’s authority to have called a special session on redistricting. Additional court challenges are underway in Cole and Jackson counties seeking to have the new map declared void because the Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to draw districts after the census every 10 years, but is silent on whether it can be done at other times.
Kehoe said he relied on his advisers on the legality of his decision to call a special session.
“I really believe they’re very good on these issues, and we think we’ll withstand all those challenges,” he said.
The case in Jackson County alleges the map is incorrect because a voting district designation is used twice in the bill. The court must decide if that is a mistake that scuttles the bill but Kehoe on Thursday said he believes it is a mistake in census mapping, not in the bill.
“Once you look at the map, if you just read the language, it doesn’t seem to make sense,” Kehoe said. “But if you read the language and you look at the map, you can see somewhere along the line there was some sort of error when they put those numbers on out of the 60,000 voting districts across the United States.”
As the case that is the most advanced in challenging the new map, the NAACP lawsuit is likely the first that will be decided. At an “emergency meeting” Wednesday, Missouri NAACP president Nimrod Chapel said the group will not waver in their effort to throw out Missouri’s new congressional map.
If successful, the lawsuit will not only get the new map tossed but also remove a proposed constitutional amendment from the ballot that would change the way majorities are counted for constitutional changes proposed by initiative petitions.
“We recognized instantly that gerrymandering in the state of Missouri targeted two Black congressional districts, Kansas City and St. Louis,” Chapel said. “Not only is this an attack on the most populated urban centers within the state of Missouri, but it’s also an attack on Black and brown voices whose needs are distinct, in some ways, from rural Missouri.”
Since the special session ended on Sept. 12, the NAACP has filed an amended petition asking for the map to be scrapped. The state’s attorney, Solicitor General Louis Capozzi, has said the lawsuit should be dismissed because lawmakers have already adjourned.
Chapel also said he believes that the use of the same voting district designation twice in the bill is a mistake that will undermine the new map.
“There is a map that’s been proposed and is sitting on the governor’s desk that cannot be signed,” Chapel said, “and the reason that it cannot be signed is because it has precincts that will get to vote on multiple occasions.”
Chapel said the NAACP is prepared to appeal the case to the Missouri Supreme Court if the judge sides with the governor.
“We’re suing them,” he said, “and we will keep suing them until they get it right.”

“It’s a critical step that the US and other nations recognize Palestinian statehood now,” said Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., in a statement Thursday.

Vermont’s three members of Congress are all calling on President Donald Trump and his administration to recognize an independent Palestinian state.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are among eight senators sponsoring a resolution that urges the White House “to recognize a demilitarized State of Palestine, as consistent with international law and the principles of a two-state solution, alongside a secure State of Israel.”
The resolution, which is led by Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, is the first of its kind in the Senate, Welch’s office said in a statement. Other than Sanders, all of its backers are Democrats.
Meanwhile, Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has signed onto a letter with dozens of her House Democratic colleagues asking the same of Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The existence of the House letter, which is led by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was first reported by The Guardian Thursday morning. A spokesperson for Balint’s office, Sophie Pollock, said later Thursday that Balint was among the signatories.
“Just as the lives of Palestinians must be immediately protected, so too must their rights as a people and nation urgently be acknowledged and upheld,” the letter says, according to The Guardian. “We encourage the governments of other countries that have yet to recognize Palestinian statehood, including the United States, to do so as well.”
The Guardian reported that Khanna plans to deliver the letter to Trump on Friday.
Welch’s and Sanders’ resolution has slim chances of advancing in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. It’s also unlikely that either their resolution, or the letter circulating among Democrats in the GOP-controlled House, would ultimately persuade the White House to recognize a Palestinian state. 
Trump said Tuesday in remarks to the United Nations General Assembly, which is meeting in New York City this week, that recognizing Palestinian statehood amounts to “a reward” for Hamas, the group that governs Gaza and was responsible for the brutal terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
Still, the U.S. legislators’ push comes as there has been growing international support in recent days for Palestinian statehood among major U.S. allies including Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Australia. A number of other countries have also granted that recognition during this week’s General Assembly.
In all, more than 150 countries recognize Palestine as its own state, though the U.S. is not among them. Recognition of Palestinian statehood is a largely symbolic gesture, though supporters have argued it will keep pressure on global leaders to work toward finding a two-state solution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which also encompasses dispute over control of the West Bank, not just the Gaza Strip.
The push for greater recognition comes nearly two years into Israel’s war in Gaza that, according to the latest estimates from local health authorities, has killed about 65,000 people in the Middle Eastern enclave. Israel’s military campaign has spurred rampant hunger in the region and destroyed vast swaths of Gaza’s infrastructure.
Last week, an independent United Nations commission concluded that Israel’s military has committed acts of genocide in Gaza since the October 2023 attack. All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation then became some of the first among their colleagues to publicly label the country’s offensive as a genocide.
The delegation’s push also comes as five members of Vermont’s Legislature — Democrats and Republicans — joined legislators from other states across the country on a trip around Israel last week that was funded by the Israeli government.
Welch said in a statement submitted for the congressional record last week that while senators could not unilaterally recognize an independent Palestine on their own, his and Sanders’ resolution “aligns with the objective of nearly 80 years of United States policy: two independent states and lasting peace in the Middle East.”  
“The choice before us is clear: either we embrace the two-state solution or continue to support today’s relentless military occupation,” Welch said. “This horrible death and destruction in Gaza must stop. That is why the time for two states can be delayed no longer.”
Balint also echoed support for a two-state solution in a statement Thursday.
“This is the most viable path forward to find stability, peace and to hold all nations accountable to international law,” she said. “It’s a critical step that the US and other nations recognize Palestinian statehood now.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Coogle said that Democrats’ ability to conduct oversight visits without preapproval is not only needed, but already signed into law.  The suit, filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, charges that the Trump administration has overreached its authority in creating a policy to require members of Congress give DHS seven days’ notice, plus approval from an agency official, before visiting a facility where immigrants are detained. The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.  DOJ argues against DemsAppearing on behalf of the Trump administration, Department of Justice attorney Alexander Resar said that the entire case will be moot in three business days, citing the looming government shutdown by next week. He argued that because the appropriations law will expire, lawmakers will not have the authority to conduct oversight provided under that provision. Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.“We expect it to be included,” in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations, Coogle said. Resar also argued that because that provision is attached to appropriations law, the administration views it as not as enforceable as a separate law passed by Congress.  He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials. Republicans control both chambers in Congress as well as the White House. Cobb questioned why two administrations, that of Biden and the first Trump administration, signed the appropriations bills into law for the past five years if they had an issue with the provision.Resar said because the provision is attached to an appropriations bill, the Trump administration argues that it doesn’t reach the level of statutory authority. Blocked from entryDemocrats detailed in their suit that since June, DHS officials have blocked them from entering facilities that detain immigrants. Coogle said members of Congress being able to show up unannounced is an important tool, as in the past lawmakers have detailed how DHS has quickly made changes in preparation for planned visits. She said some of those changes include painting facilities and moving detainees.Resar argued that “if the facilities are being changed for the better,” then planned visits seem beneficial overall. The oversight policy that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced at DHS facilities that detain immigrants, including ICE field offices, stems from the first Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border in 2018. At that time, Democrats such as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who represents the border town of El Paso, were unable to conduct interviews with separated immigrant families and often denied entry into the facilities. That led to the inclusion of a provision in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations law that codified a member of Congress’ ability to conduct in-person oversight visits at DHS facilities where minors were detained. The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.Twelve Democratic House members are part of the suit including Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.",,,,2025-09-25 17:57:13.258819

Markey: Pass the torch,James Nichols-Worley and Milan Singh,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/sen-markey-pass-the-torch/,"HAD JOE BIDEN won re-election, he would have been 86 years and two months old at the end of his term.

That is four months younger than Sen. Ed Markey would be at the end of the new six-year term he plans to seek next year. 
Five years ago, we were too young to vote, but both of us supported Sen. Markey in his 2020 Democratic primary race against Rep. Joe Kennedy III. We felt that, since both candidates agreed on all of the big issues, there was no good reason other than ambition driving Kennedy’s challenge, especially since many at the time thought that this would be Sen. Markey’s final campaign.  
We appreciate the senator’s work over his decades in public service, particularly his advocacy on environmental issues. But five years later, it’s time for him to pass the torch to a new generation. 
Our Commonwealth and our country face great challenges over the coming years: a cost-of-living crisis that is pricing young people out of our state; an increasingly violent and unstable world; and new technologies that will reshape our society, for good and for ill. These are difficult problems without simple solutions. We should be making way for younger leaders to help shape the future that they, and those even younger than them, will be contending with long after today’s oldest elected officials are gone. 
Several other Senate Democrats have chosen retirement in recent years. Maryland’s Ben Cardin (80), Delaware’s Tom Carper (77), and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin (77) all declined to run again last year. Already this year, four more announced they would not seek re-election in 2026: Illinois’s Dick Durbin (80), New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen (78), Minnesota’s Tina Smith (67), and Michigan’s Gary Peters (66). Sen. Markey is older than all but two of them. In fact, he’s the oldest Democratic senator seeking reelection next year.  
Judging our elected officials solely by their age does have its limits. Take former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, now 85, who is still playing an influential role in California and national politics as a member of Congress after relinquishing her role as the leader of House Democrats. Sen.  Markey, for his part, has parried criticism with an oft-repeated rejoinder: “It’s not your age, it’s the age of your ideas,” which has become something of a campaign mantra.  
This line of thinking resonated with us and many other young people in 2020, who admired Sen.  Markey’s bold politics, but it has run its course. Although the senator gave a vigorous speech at the Democratic State Convention earlier this month in Springfield and seems, by all accounts, in good health, his steadfast determination to run for reelection papers over the immense uncertainty surrounding his age and betrays a lack of confidence in his potential successors. 
According to actuarial data collected by the Social Security Administration, an American male aged 87 has about a one in eight chance of dying in the following year. An 82-year-old male — the age Sen. Markey would be at the start of his next six-year term — has a life expectancy of just seven years. One-third of Americans over the age of 85 suffer from some form of dementia. 
As we’ve seen all too often in recent years, there are real risks when public officials remain in office well into old age. Just this year, three House Democrats have died in office. Towards the end of her career, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who died while still in office at age 90, was reported to be “bewildered or disengaged” and suffering from diminished capabilities. And in the case that put the issue front and center for all Americans to see, the Joe Biden of six years ago is unrecognizable compared to the one we saw in the disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last summer. 
We’re not alone in holding these concerns. A poll from the University of New Hampshire found that 55 percent of Massachusetts voters — including 57 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of independent voters, and 55 percent of Republicans — are concerned about Senator Markey’s age. The same poll found that 43 percent of Massachusetts voters do not think that Sen. Markey deserves reelection, compared with 33 percent who think he does and 25 percent who are unsure.  
Even among those who think Sen. Markey deserves to be reelected, nearly half — 48 percent — are concerned about his age. A recent poll of voters under 30 found that two of the top three (out of 31) best-testing democracy reform proposals were term limits for Congress and an age limit of 75 for elected officials generally.    
Despite this, Sen. Markey has managed to trot out endorsements from across the state, and his campaign has sent half a dozen emails asking volunteers to “personally endorse Senator Ed Markey.” Before meetings with Sen. Markey earlier this year, volunteers and activists were asked to appear in videos for the campaign endorsing him. One of us was contacted personally to participate in such a video. 
Sen. Markey’s insistence on running again — despite clear concern from voters about his age —  is essentially a statement that he alone is the only Democrat who can serve the people of Massachusetts. With all due respect, we just don’t think that’s true. 
Massachusetts has a deep bench of would-be candidates who share Sen. Markey’s commitment to the Democratic Party’s values — standing up for regular people, trying to pass laws that make our lives just a little bit easier, and fighting against the abuses of the Trump administration.  
Not waiting for the seat to open up, Rep. Seth Moulton is reportedly considering challenging Sen. Markey in next year’s Democratic primary. Among other potential Senate candidates who share Sen. Markey’s core commitments, some, like Rep. Ayanna Pressley, adhere to the senator’s particular brand of progressivism; others, like Rep. Jake Auchincloss, have embraced newer ideas like the Abundance agenda.  
Sen. Markey has had a long and honorable career in public service. But we believe that it is time for him to step aside. Nothing could do more to invigorate the Massachusetts Democratic Party at this challenging time for our country than to give voters a chance to choose a nominee – and hopefully their next senator — in a competitive, open primary election.

Dairy manufacturer HP Hood has confirmed it plans to close the Booth Bros. manufacturing plant in Barre in April. 
The Booth Bros. facility, which bottles different milk varieties, has been operating in Barre since 1946 and was sold to Hood in 1997. Approximately 50 employees will be affected by the closure, Hood spokesperson Lynne Bohan said in an email. 
Hood decided on the closure after a review of the company’s milk operations in the Northeast, Bohan said. 
“Hood carefully reviewed each of its fluid plant’s geographic locations, current production capacity, as well as rising infrastructure costs,” she said.

The company is planning to provide severance packages and outplacement assistance to the affected employees, Bohan said
She added that Hood is working to transition the manufacturing in Barre to other Hood plants. The company has 11 other plants listed on its website, located in New England, New York, Virginia and California. The company also still plans to manufacture Booth Bros.-branded products and sell them in Vermont, Bohan said.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials are reportedly considering building a detention facility at the controversial Franklin County state prison site, further frustrating locals who say they’ve been left in the dark by state officials once again.
Franklin County Sheriff Johnny Crocker told the Advocate Thursday that Chief Deputy Jon Little was patrolling the area Monday when he encountered three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from the agency’s New Orleans office at the entrance of the site. Joe Profiri, a special adviser to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the former secretary of the Department of Corrections, arrived a few minutes later, and he and the agents entered the property.
Describing the agents as “super friendly,” Crocker said they told Little they were looking at potentially building a migrant detention facility at the Franklin County prison site.
“And Jon goes, ‘Well, man, this may not be up for the next three to five years. If the prison even goes in, there’s still a lot of things going on,’” Crocker said. “And the ICE agent stated, ‘No, we can have this up very quickly, we’ll put a temporary one up first.’”
Crocker said that when Profiri arrived, the former corrections secretary did not want to talk to the chief deputy. Profiri acted aggravated that Little was there, Crocker said.
Arkansas legislators skeptical of prison site selection, frustrated over absence of Sanders staff

Local officials were not informed that the 815-acre site was being considered for use as an immigration detention facility, Crocker said.  The sheriff expressed deep displeasure with how the prison saga has been handled, calling the lack of information “cowardly” and dishonest. He said he supports Sanders in general as a conservative, but “I do not support this.”
“It frustrates me that leading individuals of this state are being very quiet and very sneaky and lying to the people of this state, and it needs to be fixed,” Crocker said.
“Be transparent with people, let them know what’s going on,” he said. “Taxpayers should have input. We don’t live under a … dictator. What they’ve done is wrong.”
Crocker’s attitude reflects the opinions of many Franklin County officials and residents, who’ve complained they were blindsided by Sanders’ announcement of the nearly $3 million purchase of the property on Oct. 31, 2024.
The site is unworkable, Crocker added, because there’s “no water there,” nor are there local utilities that can provide water. “They’re going to put them in a cattle pasture. That’s what this place is,” he said. “They spent $100 million on nothing, so is this their bailout? That’s my question.”
Franklin County water well testing summary released

The state Legislature previously appropriated $75 million toward prison capital improvements but failed this year to appropriate a requested $750 million specifically for the proposed mega-prison. In addition to the $2.9 million cost of the property, the Board of Corrections hired Vanir Construction Management as its new prison project manager on a four-year, $16.5 million contract. The board also approved a $57-million design contract for the prison, but the Arkansas Legislative Council has not yet taken it up for final approval.
Governor’s office comment
When asked to confirm whether the site visit with Profiri occurred, Sam Dubke, Sanders’ spokesperson, did not explicitly confirm or deny it, nor did he answer specific questions about the state’s discussions with ICE regarding the site and what actions had been taken to consult with local officials.
“Governor Sanders’ Administration is in ongoing conversations with the Trump Administration and federal immigration officials on how to best support the President’s work to secure the border and get violent, criminal illegal aliens off our streets,” Dubke wrote in a text message to the Advocate.
Local officials weren’t the only ones who didn’t know about the visit or potential for an immigration detention facility. The state Department of Corrections was also left in the dark, according to spokesperson Rand Champion.
“The Department became aware of reports of a site visit late Wednesday,” Champion told the Advocate in a text message Thursday. “To my knowledge we have not been involved in those discussions as it would fall under federal jurisdiction.”
Adam Watson, an outspoken opponent of the prison project and director of online site Gravel and Grit, pointed to ICE’s visit as another example of Sanders’ office not consulting with local communities or the state officials who oversee state prisons on major decisions impacting their communities.
Watson said he had no clue what the end game was in allowing ICE to potentially use the site, but that it does nothing to change the minds of people in the local community about the prison. The site, he said, is still completely unsuitable for either a federal or state facility, pointing to concerns about a lack of available water, and other utilities and infrastructure.
“I don’t know if the governor thought that this was going to be something to garner additional support from such a conservative community” by working to assist with immigration detentions, Watson said. “But it’s been exactly the opposite, so if that was the intent, it backfired.”
Franklin County radio station KDYN was first to report about ICE’s visit Thursday morning. Many commenters on KDYN’s Facebook post about the visit seemed to agree with Watson’s and Crocker’s concerns.
“I have more objections to this than a regular prison!” Emily A Barton wrote.
Some commenters conjectured that Arkansas might be allowing immigration detention in order to reduce the cost of constructing the proposed 3,000-bed prison. The most recent estimates peg construction costs at $825 million.
“[P]robably running out of money to get it up and running,” David Kathleen Hedges wrote. “If they get federal money involve[d] it takes care of their problem. The people we voted in obviously don’t care about we the people. Whatever it takes to get their prison built is what they will do.”
Even people who say they support the prison weren’t enthused.
“I support the prison but it’s pretty ridiculous that they are doing all this behind our county administration’s back,” RD Brooks wrote.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman’s office said: “We have not been contacted by any officials from the state or federal government regarding an ICE facility in Franklin County.”
ICE’s New Orleans office and national headquarters did not immediatley respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia traveled to Alachua County Thursday, where he said his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team of auditors had determined that the local government had indulged in more than $84 million in “wasteful spending” over the past five years.
He said that meant that the county’s general fund budget has grown by $140 million since 2019-2020, or 77%. Gainesville is the county seat.
But as has been the case with the other local government budgets that Ingoglia’s team has reviewed this year, he did not mention any specific programs that constituted what he defined as wasteful spending.
“I will tell you that I was at a meeting this morning and I have seen some of the things that your local government is spending money, and I can assure you that I think the taxpayers would be very unhappy with what they’re spending the money on,” he said.
When pressed by a reporter to give his definition of a superfluous program, Ingoglia wouldn’t do so.
“It’s not our job to micromanage,” he said. “The people who should be micromanaging are the people who get paid to micromanage.”
This was Ingoglia’s fourth preliminary report of a local government’s alleged overspending announced since last month, shortly after he was appointed to serve as CFO by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
On Wednesday, he claimed that Hillsborough County had overspent by nearly $279 million. Last week, he alleged that Orange County had overspent by more than $190 million, and the city of Jacksonville’s government by $200 million.
The announcements are taking place as he (and the governor) travel up and down the state making the case that Floridians should vote next year for a (still to be written) constitutional amendment to eliminate or severely reduce property taxes.
One thing that Ingoglia did not mention during his press conference is the fact that, for the ninth consecutive year, the Alachua County Commission has reduced its countywide property tax millage rate. In the $947 million Fiscal Year 2026 budget approved earlier this year week, leaders reduced the rate by 15%.
“Approving this budget is a testament to our commitment to fiscal responsibility and community priorities,” said Commission Chair Charles Chestnut IV in a written statement. “I am proud that we have reduced the millage rate for the ninth consecutive year in our ongoing efforts to ease the tax burden on residents while still funding essential services like public safety, infrastructure, and programs that enhance our residents’ quality of life.”
Alachua County officials said immediately after Ingoglia’s press conference that they weren’t prepared to provide any formal response.
“We listened to the press conference and we will take the next couple of days to check on what he has to say,” said Mark Sexton, the county communications director.
Ingoglia has been making the case that local governments are overspending to preempt criticism by local government officials that reducing property taxes would severely harm basic government services that they pay for, such as police, fire, parks and recreation, libraries, and public health.
Local government officials in other parts of the state have defended their increased budgets in recent years, citing inflation and rising population.
“We’ve already accounted for fire and police,” Ingoglia said Thursday, anticipating that’s what local officials in Alachua may claim.
“As populations grow, you are going to need more fire. You are going to need more police,” he acknowledged. “What it doesn’t mean is that you’re going to need more bureaucrats. And that’s what we have seen. A lot of these governments are expanding the bureaucracy, not necessarily the things that they are supposed to be funding.”
Ingoglia noted that the focus has been on property taxes generated from the general fund budget, not including school boards. “I will tell you from some of the numbers that I have seen, the school boards are some of the biggest, wasteful spenders that I have seen.”

Leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration are coming up with a plan for how to handle out-of-state employees in the governor’s return-to-office initiative. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Data: How many Vermont state government employees live out of state?.","Starting Dec. 1, state employees will need to return to the office at least three days per week, part of a new hybrid work schedule proposed by Gov. Phil Scott. But where do they currently reside?
As part of the return-to-office process, Scott created an advisory group of state leaders to hash out the logistics of the policy change. Among the lingering questions: how to handle government employees who live out of state, a population that’s grown since the Covid-19 pandemic normalized remote work for many. 
Administration officials said they have not yet figured out how to handle the hybrid schedule for out-of-state workers. Beth Fastiggi, Department of Human Resources commissioner, declined an interview request, citing the ongoing work of the advisory group.

The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, opposes the hybrid back-to-office plan. What matters is that work gets done, not where it gets done, according to Steve Howard, the union’s executive director.
“We’ve been benefiting from their talent and experience, and there’s no reason to uproot them,” he said of out-of-state employees. 
According to Howard, many state workers who live far from Vermont either previously worked locally and would have left state service if not for remote work, or they fill positions that are hard to recruit. 
To be sure, many out-of-state employees regularly report to a Vermont job site. Of the 552 state employees who lived out of state as of September 2025, 433 lived across Vermont’s borders in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York or Quebec. But another 119 lived further afield in states like Florida or North Carolina. As of this month, state employees reside in 31 different states and one Canadian province. 
Many out-of-state workers are also seasonally employed. 
The number of out-of-state workers has risen significantly over the past few years. In 2019, just before the Covid pandemic began, Vermont hired 559 out-of-state employees throughout the year. Five years later, the state reported hiring 753 out-of-state workers through the course of 2024. 
The top department for out-of-state employees was the Department of Corrections, followed by the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Health.

In southwest Louisiana, the Cameron Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness urged people using “cellular devices” to contact a local number for emergencies due to a “massive phone outage.” But the agency said that calls to 911 via a landline “will still go through.”
Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office is one agency where their 911 line is still operation. The department said in a statement that they use the “Next Generation 911” system – which is a “complete overhaul” of the current system, replacing “legacy copper wire technology.”
In the meantime, residents in impacted areas are urged to call alternative emergency service numbers, posted by law enforcement on social media, as needed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25153740/priscilla-du-preez-BjhUu6BpUZA-unsplash.jpg,,,2025-09-25 16:57:43.102491

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The state Broadband Office is preparing to hook into the information superhighway the last remaining South Carolina homes and businesses without high-speed internet access.
The public has until just before midnight Friday to comment on the state’s plan, which state broadband chief Jim Stritzinger called “the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina.” The office will then submit for final approval the plan for spending it’s share of a $42 billion federal grant program.
The milestone is one to celebrate. Still, how the state plans to link up about half of its final locations raises concerns about affordability and reliability, some broadband groups say.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of broadband and the state’s digital divide. Without high-speed internet, people couldn’t work or attend classes amid closures. In rural areas where healthcare access is thin, patients are increasingly turning to virtual visits with doctors. But being diagnosed by a physician over a video call is nearly impossible without a good connection.
Legislators recognized broadband was a critical need, not a luxury. In response, they designated $490 million over two years toward extending accessibility statewide, the bulk of it from federal COVID aid packages. The biggest single chunk — $400 million approved in May 2022 — came from the $2.5 billion that flowed to state coffers from the American Rescue Plan.

With that $400 million, combined with $263 million in private investment, state-contracted companies added high-speed internet access to more than 117,000 homes, businesses and community buildings, such as schools and libraries.
When that money ran dry last year, there were about 20,480 locations still without a connection, according to the latest data from the state Broadband Office — down from an earlier estimate of about 32,000.
Infrastructure funds for broadband
The state then turned its attention to another federal grant program — Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) — funded through the federal Infrastructure Investment spending package passed by Congress in November 2021.
That program, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., brought $551.5 million into the state, but under the final plan up for review, the state says it needs only a fraction — 7.5% — of it.
According to the Broadband Office, which the Legislature officially created in 2021, the state’s early investments of pandemic relief funds toward broadband, starting with $50 million in June 2020, provided a head start. Private companies also have expanded their service areas and made investments that helped fill in gaps.
What will become of the remaining funds is unknown.
States were supposed to be allowed to use leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment. But the federal telecommunications agency has not yet released guidance since the Trump administration revised the rules in June.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that (the National Telecommunications and Information Administration) may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband in the Chicago area, told States Newsroom affiliate Stateline.
South Carolina is far from the only state with a potential surplus:

In Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated funds.
In Nevada, that number is nearly $250 million.
Arizona — $481 million left over
Kentucky — $623 million
Mississippi — $633 million
Louisiana — $750 million
North Carolina — $1 billion

And the list goes on, according to the Benton Institute, which has been tracking these plans.
Most of the state plans do not mention how they would like to spend the remaining funds.
But Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, in a letter sent earlier this month, asked the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers the program, to allow states to spend it on artificial intelligence efforts and education and workforce initiatives. Louisiana also previously sought to spend the funds on rural healthcare.
Program changes
The program changes implemented by the Trump administration, which put a focus on driving down costs as much as possible, also has led to other shifts, said Alex Karras, a researcher with the Broadband Expanded project at New York Law School. Namely, more states have turned to satellite internet companies that cost less to build but tend to have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable, favored for its speed and durability.
That includes Elon Musk’s Starlink, which states could award about $10 billion worth of projects nationwide, according to The Wall Street Journal. There’s also Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which has yet to start service as it has struggled to get satellites into space, the Journal also reported.
Under South Carolina’s state plan, the two tech giants are in line for $7.9 million worth of contracts, covering 49% of the remaining unserved homes and businesses. While these locations are scattered across the state, there are clusters in the rural areas surrounding Greenville, Columbia, Florence and Orangeburg, as well as Cherokee, Darlington, and Hampton counties, that will rely on the satellites for service, according to a map put out by the Broadband Office.
It’s a bird, it’s a plane. No, it’s broadband!

While not as fast as fiber-optic cables, the satellites could reach parts of the state where installing cables is difficult, Stritzinger has previously said.
And though satellite internet makes up a large chunk of this latest investment round, it accounts for less than 1% of the locations where the state has worked to add service, according to the Broadband Office.
Whether satellite internet technology will be able to consistently meet the minimum speed requirements under the federal program remains in question. In a Starlink test program, only 17.4% of users were getting high enough speeds over the first three months of 2025, according to an analysis by Ookla, a company that measures internet speeds.
However, the analysis noted, the company’s speeds have increased significantly over the past several years. The challenge will be maintaining that speed as the company adds more customers.
“If four out of five subscribers aren’t getting broadband speeds today, what do people think is going to happen when you add in hundreds of thousands of new users?” Sascha Meinrath, a professor at Penn State and co-author of a recent study questioning whether Starlink, the internet division of SpaceX, can meet the program’s requirements, told Spotlight Pennsylvania.
Also under the program rule changes, while internet providers must still offer low-cost residential service options, states no longer have the power to dictate the rates.

Amazon has yet to publicize the rates it plans to charge when its satellite system is operational. In the test program, Starlink gave free equipment, valued at $350, to each user who agreed to sign up for a one-year plan that cost $120 per month for higher speeds and $80 per month for lower ones.
A grant program offering low-income families a $100 discount to buy equipment and a $30 monthly discount on their internet bill ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Remaining locations
While states have been finalizing their plans this month, rollout of the BEAD program was delayed after the Trump administration asked states to recheck their list of unserved locations to search for duplications and other unnecessary service areas.
For South Carolina, that proved to be a useful exercise. The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.
The vast majority of those — about 6,790 locations — already received service via high-speed fiber installed during other projects funded by COVID relief dollars or a state-funded grant program.
Another 3,370 locations already had privately funded internet access. And about 1,800 were mistakes and duplications on the map.
A smaller portion of the locations were found to be structures that didn’t actually need service — garages, barns, grain silos, demolished or uninhabitable buildings.
Once the final round is complete, the federal dollars, combined with state, and private investments, will have added service to more than 200,000 locations statewide, Stritzinger said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/internet-access-300x200-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 16:57:43.102491

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to increase rates by $128 million, which will raise the average residential electric bill about $8.47 each month. 
The Kansas Corporation Commission approved the unanimous settlement agreement that had been reached in the case, although Commissioner Dwight Keen filed a partial dissent.   
The decision was reached after public hearings, negotiations between intervenors in the case and evidentiary hearings before the commission. The case was opened in January, with Evergy initially asking for a base rate increase of $192 million of total retail revenue.
The order did not set a recommended return on equity for investors but set a 9.7% return on equity to be used for transmission delivery charges, which covers costs associated with building and maintaining the transmission system.
Keen partially dissented from Thursday’s order because he thought the 9.7% return on equity to be too high. 
“In my opinion, this ROE is excessive and may present ongoing affordability issues for all EKC (Evergy Kansas Central) customer classes – in particular the most burdened and vulnerable residential retail and small general service ratepayer (SGS) classes,” Keen wrote in his dissent.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A New York City charter school network will set up shop in Miami now that the Florida Legislature and Board of Education have lowered standards for “Schools of Hope” to operate near low-performing schools. 
The development comes months after a last-minute effort by legislators to expand the area and scope that Schools of Hope (publicly funded and privately operated charter schools that may open in areas adjacent to “persistently low performing” traditional public schools) may serve.
During a news conference Thursday in Miami, Gov. Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, and Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas were joined by Success Academy’s CEO Eva Moskowitz and Citadel hedge fund founder and CEO Ken Griffin, who will donate $50 million for the schools to come to Miami. 
“Ken, you’re not only helping the children of Miami and the Sunshine State, but you’re sending a national message, like the governor, that children, poor children, matter, that excellence matters, that the American dream matters and it’s time to get going,” Moskowitz, a former New York City Council member, said. 
Success Academy operates about 60 K-12 charter schools in New York and pumps out high-performing students, although it has been criticized for weeding out students in a way that traditional public schools cannot based on behavior and parental involvement. 
According to Success Academy, the majority of its 22,000 students “are from low-income households in New York City’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods” through “a random public lottery.”
“Today, we are proving that all children, no matter their background, no matter their zip code, no matter where they live, they can have access to a world-class education,” Kamoutsas said.
The governor praised the move as a major addition to the state’s school-choice ecosystem, which critics have derided for straining the budgets and enrollment of traditional public schools.
DeSantis insisted that when traditional public schools lose students to charter schools, “then they’re going to have to do something to earn the trust of those parents back.”
Success Academy will open its first schools in Miami for the 2027-2028 school year. The Miami Herald reported that the charter organization hopes to have three to five schools operating by then.
“Competition drives excellence, a rising tide floats all boats. When good people and good organizations step up beside us to help push forward and lead, everybody gets stronger because of it. Having Ken Griffin and Success Academy come to Florida is just that catalyst. It’s an opportunity to push things forward, to achieve greatness, to push boundaries that we maybe haven’t hit that much yet,” Collins said. 
The law, SB 2510, passed during the extended legislative session in June, was implemented by the State Board of Education on Wednesday. It allows schools of hope to open in low-income zones, or even outside of such zones if there is a suitable underused, vacant, or surplus facility, and in the attendance zone of a “persistently low performing school.” 
Under the new law, “hope operators,” like Success Academy, are allowed to open inside of vacant spaces inside public schools at no cost. School districts must provide custodial, maintenance, safety, food, nursing, and transportation services if the school of hope requests it.
The law expanded the criteria for what defines a persistently low-performing school. According to The Florida Times-Union, the change increased the number of those schools by 423%, jumping from 51 in 2024 to 267 in 2025, meaning there are more spaces for Success Academy to step in and receive public funds to operate. 
Independent reporter Jason Garcia reported that Success Academy lobbied the Legislature, including providing bill language. 
Garcia also reports that Griffin made nearly $30 million in campaign contributions in the state during the 2024 elections, including $12 million to a political committee that opposed the proposed state constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana, which the governor strongly opposed.
He also gave $4 million to Senate President Ben Albritton’s campaign committee, and the same amount to House Speaker Daniel Perez’s campaign committee.
Griffin, born in Florida, founded Citadel in Chicago in the 1990s. He moved Citadel to Miami in 2022.
“I think Miami’s just the beginning, I think where there’s needs around this state, I think you’re going to see Success Academy make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Following a sojourn in two separate committees, legislation permitting the Attorney General to investigate and enforce campaign finance violations against the Secretary of State is heading back to the Michigan House floor. 
House Bill 4642 was put forth by Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), the chair of the House Election Integrity Committee, after the Michigan Department of Attorney General determined Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson violated campaign finance law. 
Although the department determined Benson’s decision to hold a press conference launching her campaign for governor in the lobby of the Austin Building – which houses the Department of State – was a violation of Michigan Campaign Finance Act, the Department of Attorney General noted that it did not hold the legal authority to impose civil or criminal penalties on Benson. 
Violations of the act are usually investigated and resolved by the Secretary of State while the attorney general is charged with investigating complaints involving the Secretary of State. However, the law was silent on how the Department of Attorney General should resolve a complaint against the Secretary of State if it’s determined that a violation occurred.
Rigas’ bill amends the Michigan Campaign Finance Act to grant the attorney general the same authority in investigating and resolving campaign finance violations. Similar legislation was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Allen). 
“No one, especially not the Secretary of State, should be immune from accountability. We’re fixing a broken system to ensure fairness and uphold the law,” Rigas said in a statement when the bill was introduced. 
While the bill was initially referred to the House Election Integrity Committee, it was later referred to the Rules committee, with all nine members agreeing on Wednesday to send the matter to the House floor for further consideration.

In a news release, the sheriff’s office said Taylor’s campaign manager reported earlier in the day that the campaign had received a text message threatening the delegate’s life. Investigators developed a suspect and arrested Strawmeyer at 2:15 p.m. 
He is being held without bond at Meherrin River Regional Jail in Alberta, pending an initial appearance in Dinwiddie County General District Court.
Taylor’s campaign said she is safe and praised law enforcement for its swift action.
“Earlier today, Delegate Kim Taylor received a politically motivated death threat by text message to her campaign. Our campaign takes every threat seriously and this was no exception. Thanks to the Sheriff’s Department and law enforcement partners, the individual responsible is already in custody,” campaign spokesperson Jacklyn Washington said in a statement.
“Delegate Taylor is safe and doing well,” Washington added. “She is grateful for the decisive action of law enforcement and remains focused on serving her constituents. No threat will distract her from the work she was elected to do.”
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger also condemned the threat. “I am horrified to hear about the death threat made against Delegate Kim Taylor — and I am relieved to hear that the suspect is now in custody,” Spanberger wrote on social media. “I am thinking of Delegate Taylor and her family, and I am grateful for our local law enforcement who worked swiftly on this case.”
Taylor, a Republican delegate since 2022, represents the 82nd District, which covers parts of Chesterfield, Dinwiddie and Prince George counties, along with the city of Petersburg and parts of Hopewell. She won her seat in a 2021 upset against Del. Lashrecse Aird, a Democrat, a victory that helped Republicans regain control of the House of Delegates.
She was narrowly re-elected in 2023 after a recount confirmed her 53-vote edge over Democratic challenger Kimberly Pope Adams. Earlier this year, Taylor drew attention as one of five Republican delegates who joined Democrats in supporting legislation to safeguard same-sex marriage in Virginia.
Away from politics, Taylor is a small business owner who operates car repair shops with her husband, Butch, employing about 30 people. On her campaign website, she highlights her work on school safety legislation, efforts to support victims of human trafficking, and votes for broad tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks.
Law enforcement officials said the investigation into the threat remains ongoing.

A press release from the Department of Corrections said McLain died by “apparent suicide.” He was found unresponsive in his cell, the release said, and taken to a Sioux Falls hospital, where he died.

On Tuesday, inmate Kaleb Lukkes, 25, was found unresponsive in his South Dakota State Penitentiary cell. 
“This death is being aggressively investigated in collaboration with the Division of Criminal Investigation and the DOC Office of the Inspector General,” Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
Lukkes died on the same day lawmakers and Gov. Larry Rhoden met for a special legislative session at the Capitol in Pierre and approved a plan to build a 1,500-bed, $650 million men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls. 
On Wednesday, 64-year-old Frank Twiggs died “in a comfort care setting” at the Jameson Annex.
A request for a response to the deaths sent to spokespeople for Rhoden was not immediately returned Thursday. 
South Dakota tracks inmate deaths by state fiscal years, which run from July 1 through June 30. The three deaths this week bring the number of deaths for fiscal year 2026 to six, consistent with a recent uptick for in-custody deaths.
The department says there were 19 in-custody deaths during the fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s the highest fiscal year tally since at least 2018. 
Since the beginning of the 2025 calendar year, 18 men have died in South Dakota prisons, at least four by suicide. Another three men died from drug overdoses. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley announced charges in drug distribution cases tied to those deaths earlier this summer, and announced charges last week against a separate set of defendants — including one former correctional officer – for their alleged roles in a drug smuggling ring.

(Photo by Getty Images)A western Iowa county is being sued over the federal government’s refusal to release jailed immigration detainees, even in cases where judges have ordered their release on bond.
The lawsuits claim that federal immigration officials have concocted a “scheme” whereby detainees with no criminal record can be jailed indefinitely despite judges approving their release upon payment of a bond.
The cases stem from a policy that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security adopted in July 2025, holding that all employees of DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), were to consider anyone who is alleged to have entered the United States illegally to be subject to mandatory detention.

When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.
In the past three weeks, a growing number of detainees have sought relief from such rulings by filing lawsuits that go before federal judges in U.S. District Court. That’s partly because of a Sept. 5, 2025, decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In that decision, the board adopted DHS’ latest interpretation of the law, finding that immigration judges lack the authority to even consider bond requests.
Now, another twist has been added to the legal conflict: Even in those cases where an immigration judge has set a bond for immigration detainees seeking release while their cases are pending, Homeland Security and ICE are refusing to accept payment of that bond and are keeping the detainees behind bars in county jails.
The result is that counties operating those jails are now being sued in federal court. In Iowa’s Woodbury County, for example, two such lawsuits were filed in the past week.
One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City. According to court records, that arrest stemmed from an ICE and Drug Enforcement Administration surveillance operation that centered on another individual.
According to Garcia’s attorneys, the government has admitted that because Garcia “looked like” the individual being sought, he was detained and was later charged by ICE for having no legitimate immigration status in the United States.
Garcia has lived in Iowa for about nine years and has no criminal history, according to his lawyers.
Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge. Citing Garcia’s lack of criminal history and his ties to the community, the judge on Sept. 12, 2025, ordered Garcia’s release upon payment of a $6,000 bond. Garcia’s family then attempted, without success, to post the bond.
“ICE will not allow them to post it,” Garcia’s lawyers argue in their newly filed lawsuit. “ICE refuses to release Mr. Garcia from custody, relying on a federal regulation giving DHS unilateral authority to block an immigration judge’s custody order.”
Garcia’s lawyers are now asking a U.S. District Court judge to intervene, rule that Garcia’s detention is unconstitutional, and order his release from jail upon payment of the bond.
As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Sheehan at his office on Thursday.
“For nine years, Garcia has worked hard, paid taxes, and contributed to the Iowa community,” Garcia’s lawyers have told the court in seeking intervention. “Mr. Garcia has significant ties to the community … He has many friends and is a skilled mechanic who often helps his community while expecting nothing in return. He has no criminal record and has never had any legal issues whatsoever until the current civil proceedings. Mr. Garcia was arrested by ICE on August 8, 2025, while walking out of his home because he apparently resembled a different man the government actually intended to arrest.”
The other Woodbury County case involves Francisco Torres Aleman, 34, of Omaha, who was detained in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on June 28, 2025.
According to his lawyers, Aleman was born in Guatemala and came to the United States at least 12 years ago. They say he has no criminal history and is the father of two daughters who are U.S. citizens.
Court papers filed by Aleman’s attorneys give conflicting accounts as to how Aleman was arrested. In their petition seeking intervention by U.S. District Court, they state that Aleman was “arrested following a traffic stop in Sioux Falls,” but in that same document they say he was “detained while washing his car on June 28, 2025.”
Court records indicate that on Aug. 19, 2025, an immigration judge authorized the posting of a $20,000 bond that would allow for Aleman’s release while his immigration case was pending. Aleman’s family then attempted to post the bond through the required computerized processing system called “ICE CeBonds,” but each attempt was allegedly denied.
Aleman remains behind bars in the Woodbury County Jail, his attorneys allege. In seeking court invention, they argue that his continued detention not only contradicts the judge’s order on bond, it also inhibits his ability to argue against his removal from the country in that he can’t communicate with potential witnesses or earn wages to afford legal representation in the case.
“This scheme,” Aleman’s lawyers argue in court, is “plainly designed by the executive branch to give DHS the power to circumvent both immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders … The regulations are written in such a way that it does not matter what either the immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders; if the government disagrees, the government can, through its own actions and per its own regulations, keep the noncitizen detained indefinitely.”
In addition to Sheriff Sheehan, the two Woodbury County cases name as defendants Peter Berg, the director of the ICE field office in St. Paul, Minnesota; Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE; Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security; Pamela Jo Bondi, the attorney general of the United States and head of the U.S. Department of Justice; and President Donald J. Trump .
The defendants have yet to file a response to the lawsuits.

(Stock photo by L Pettet/Getty Images)Let’s start at a place where we can all agree: In a nation of 340 million people, systems designed to serve the needs of such a large population will be imperfect. Public education is imperfect. The justice system is imperfect. Medicaid is imperfect. Social Security is imperfect. Taxation is imperfect. Road maintenance is imperfect. 
Pick a system, at any level of government from local to federal, and you will find proof of defect.
It is when we try to move forward together from that point of unity that the nation’s major fault lines emerge. We can’t agree on what exactly is broken, who is to blame, or how (or whether) we should go about the repairs.
Last week, I wrote that the fundamental tension in New Hampshire and the United States — the primary fault line — stems from a dispute over how public money should move. The defining position of the right is that the potential for prosperity among the masses is directly tied to how much the government invests in its wealthiest citizens, through tax breaks for example, and the left traditionally argues that direct investment in the masses, including through programs like Medicaid and Social Security, will lead to broader prosperity and therefore a stronger nation.
Fundamentally, Americans agree that our public systems are imperfect. And, fundamentally, we are divided over the scope and value of many of those systems.
The Republican Party has long framed its efforts to dismantle systems as a desire for small government. From a political marketing perspective, that’s a wise choice. “Small-government conservative” suggests efficiency, and who doesn’t love efficiency. But their efforts are rarely surgical — despite rosy monikers like the federal “Department of Government Efficiency” or New Hampshire’s “Commission on Government Efficiency” — and so the combination of administrative layoffs and reduced funding end up making the systems even more inefficient, more fully broken. And often that’s the point — to break public systems to the degree that they are no longer worth fixing — because ultimately Republicans want that money to go to private industry.
The harm from that approach is direct and it is immediate. Medicaid, for example, serves more than 180,000 people in New Hampshire, according to KFF, a nonpartisan organization that provides health policy research. The program covers 64% of the state’s nursing home residents, 30% of its children, and 31% of working-age adults with disabilities. Nationally, 77% percent of voters hold a favorable opinion of Medicaid, including 81% of independents and 63% of Republicans.
But during the last legislative session, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a budget that increased premiums and established work requirements, amid other punitive changes to the program. After the governor signed House Bills 1 and 2, a coalition of 80 health care providers and advocates said, “These policies will shift more costs to families and low-wage individuals, imposing significant financial burdens and limiting access to care for some of New Hampshire’s most vulnerable residents.”
And, the group continued, “Beyond the direct impacts on individuals and families, safety net providers will face increased uncompensated care costs unless the state takes proactive steps to protect coverage.”
You see, in order for Republican lawmakers to continue investing in the wealthiest Americans, the money has to come from somewhere. That “somewhere” is a magical place called “smaller government,” which is really a wasteland of reduced services for poor people, people with disabilities, and residents who require nursing home care.
In New Hampshire, that translates into heavier burdens placed on low-income residents in order to pay for the elimination of the interest and dividends tax, the expansion of school vouchers to benefit high-income families, and a years-long series of aggressive business tax cuts. Among the “efficiencies” gained from this “small government” approach is a decline in care and support for already underserved populations, more economic pressure placed on property-poor towns by way of expanded school vouchers, and the forfeit of a tax paid largely by upper-income residents. And, to be clear, when I say this was a tax paid by rich people, I mean more than half of the payers of the interest and dividends tax (which brought in more than $180 million in 2024) made in excess of $200,000 in income from interest and dividends alone. How much base wealth does it even take to earn more than $200K just in interest and dividends?
Nationally, the Republicans have been even more aggressive in undermining a program that has the support of more than three-quarters of the country. That “big, beautiful bill” the GOP is so proud of cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade to pay for a $1 trillion tax cut for the richest 1%. The primary “efficiency” gained is that another 15 million low-income Americans will join the 25 million people who were uninsured even before Donald Trump’s mega-bill was signed into law. 
Will any of the $1 trillion taken from low-income people and given to the highest income people ever make its way back to the people at the bottom? That is the very foundation of the Republican platform, but the overwhelming evidence — via rapidly expanding economic inequality — says that’s not what happens at all. Money that could spare a family from having to choose between groceries and health care is instead going to those among us who are fortunate enough, for example, to collect more than $200,000 a year just in interest payments.
In what way is any of that a good deal for the masses, now or even in some imagined future?
But let’s return, just for a second, back to that original point of unity in America: Our systems, including Medicaid, are imperfect. Before we take another step and become mired once again in political confrontation, how about one more place at the beginning where we can stand together: Less suffering is preferable to more suffering. 
More than anything, that is my political position. Odds are it’s yours, too. Where, I wonder, can we go from there?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/medicaidform-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 15:57:35.011743

(Photo provided by Cass County N.D., Vector Control)A Providence County resident in their 60s is the first probable human case of West Nile virus in Rhode Island this year, the state Department of Health announced Thursday.
The case will be confirmed through further testing by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health officials did not disclose where the person was exposed, but said they began showing symptoms in early September and have remained hospitalized since. 
The Rhode Island Department of Health’s announcement comes as the state’s risk level for mosquito-borne diseases remains high, with 13 mosquito samples testing positive for West Nile virus so far this season.
The first positive mosquito sample was collected in East Providence on July 21. The second positive sample came from Bristol on July 28. The most recent samples came from Johnston, East Providence, and Cranston on Aug. 28.
Mosquitoes in the latest samples collected on Sept. 15 tested negative for West Nile virus, along with other illnesses including Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Jamestown Canyon Virus. 
West Nile virus is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. While most people infected never develop symptoms, about one in five experience West Nile fever, which can bring on headaches, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms. 
In rare cases, West Nile virus can progress to serious neuroinvasive illnesses that involve encephalitis or meningitis. The CDC reports that about 10% of these severe infections are fatal, most often among people over age 60 or those who are immunocompromised. 
As of Sept. 25, preliminary CDC data shows 1,137 West Nile virus cases across the nation, with neuroinvasive illness involved in 742 of those cases. The virus has been recorded in 42 states so far this year.
Massachusetts has recorded eight human cases, according to data from its Department of Public Health. Connecticut has had two human cases confirmed by the CDC.
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine have had no human cases so far this year, according to the CDC.
Rhode Island health officials remind residents to protect themselves against bites by wearing insect repellent, long sleeves, and pants, especially when mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Removing stagnant water from yards and outdoor areas reduces the number of places where mosquitoes can breed, and repairing holes in window or door screens can stop mosquitoes from entering the home.
Weekly mosquito testing data is posted to the Rhode Island Department of Health’s website. Additional prevention tips and resources are available at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

That’s due, in large part, to shifting federal guidelines that have narrowed the pool of people who are eligible for this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

Last week, a top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to change the recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine to allow individuals over six months of age to access the vaccine after discussing their options with a health care provider, though the panel fell short of issuing a blanket recommendation. The panel also rejected a proposal to require a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
The new recommendations must now be formally approved by the acting CDC director before they can take effect.
In some states, top officials have implemented new policies to ensure that residents can access COVID-19 shots. But Georgia has so far been slower to respond to the changing guidelines. 
Ahead of last week’s ACIP meeting, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it would be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine to local health departments until after the federal panel issued its annual recommendations. On Monday, DPH spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek said that the agency is holding off on issuing statements until the CDC officially approves the recommendations. 
Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at my local pharmacy?
In the U.S., pharmacies — rather than doctor’s offices — have increasingly become the venue where many Americans seek common vaccines like those for the flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV.
Part of the reason for that is convenience, according to Ashley Chinchilla, who works as the associate director of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences program at the University of Georgia’s College of Pharmacy.
“Pharmacies tend to have a little more flexible hours than a lot of other locations that offer vaccines,” Chinchilla said. “We tend to be open a little bit later. A lot of them have at least some weekend hours, and so for people who are working full time, it’s sometimes a little bit easier to get to a pharmacy than to another location.”

In Georgia, pharmacists can typically administer vaccines as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do. But, Chinchilla added, “the state law that allows pharmacists the authority to administer vaccines under protocol without a prescription is tied to the ACIP recommendation.” 
That means pharmacists practicing in Georgia are unable to administer an updated COVID-19 vaccine until the CDC formally approves the recommendations, and as a result, many pharmacies are still requiring a prescription for anyone seeking the vaccine.
At CVS, Georgia is one of five states where prescriptions are still required before pharmacists can administer a shot. Florida, Louisiana, Utah, West Virginia and the District of Columbia also require residents to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine prescription.
“Once the CDC approves ACIP’s recommendations, we’ll be able to offer the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines — without a prescription — in these states,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault.
Walgreens, which is offering updated COVID-19 shots in every state except Georgia, Louisiana, Utah, and the District of Columbia, said that it is also waiting for the CDC director to adopt ACIP’s updated recommendations before their pharmacists can administer the vaccine.
“Once that happens, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Georgia, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said.
Representatives for Kroger and Publix, which also operate in-store pharmacies, did not reply to requests for comment.
Where can I access the COVID-19 vaccine in my area?
Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, a pediatrician based in Hiram and a member of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that shifting policies on vaccine access have caused confusion among many of her patients over access to the vaccine.
“I think parents are very confused about what’s going on with the COVID vaccine,” she said. “They’re hearing all different things. They don’t really know what to believe. So I think there’s a lot of confusion out there.”
Her advice for parents and others who are seeking a COVID-19 vaccine is to check with their local primary care provider to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.
“Talk to your doctor, make sure that you will have access to the COVID vaccine,” Dolgoff said. “Find out where, locally, that vaccine is being offered, so that you go to the right place.”
Dr. Cecil Bennett, a family medicine doctor based in Newnan, said his office will be following recommendations from organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians, which advises everyone six months of age and older to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. He also urged patients to follow the advice of reputable, science-based organizations.
“The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, are dependable organizations that are not a part of the political spectrum,” he said. “CDC, NIH, FDA have proven to be political entities and no longer scientific and dependable entities. So patients should rely on their doctors more now for proper advice and not listen to what they hear on television from political bodies.”
I don’t have a primary care provider. Can I still get a COVID-19 vaccine?
If you don’t have a primary care provider, you’re not alone. Georgia has broad primary care provider shortages across most of the state, impacting all but three of its 159 counties.
If the ACIP recommendations are approved by the CDC’s acting director, Georgia residents will likely be able to access COVID-19 shots at their local pharmacy without needing a prescription. But until that happens, residents may be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 at retail clinics, which are typically operated out of grocery stores, pharmacies, and other retail establishments. 
Common retail clinics include CVS’ MinuteClinics and Kroger’s The Little Clinic, which offer scheduled appointments as well as walk-in visits.
Thibault, the CVS spokesperson, said that MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and therefore “are not subject to the same rules that apply to [a] pharmacy and do not require a prescription from patients to be able to administer the vaccine.”
A full list of CVS MinuteClinic locations in Georgia can be found at the MinuteClinic’s online directory. A list of Kroger’s walk-in health clinics can also be found online.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A South Dakota lobbyist hinted this week that Summit Carbon Solutions’ plan to build a 2,000-mile carbon dioxide pipeline is on life support without the ability to secure easements through eminent domain. 
Pipeline opponents in his state, according to David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce before retiring earlier this year, have argued Summit is free to move forward with the carbon dioxide pipeline that would bring 18.5 million tons of carbon dioxide to North Dakota annually. Some have said that while the company can no longer use eminent domain to secure the pipeline route without landowners’ consent, Summit could obtain voluntary easements for 100% of the project’s path. 
“I like that fantasy,” Owen said of constructing the pipeline without use of eminent domain. “I wish that were true. But it’s not.”
In addition to facing the obstacle of South Dakota’s law against eminent domain, Summit also still needs a permit from South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission for the project to move forward. 
Summit proposes to build a network of pipelines in five states to capture carbon emissions from ethanol plants. The main portion of the pipeline would run through South Dakota.

Owen was speaking Tuesday on a panel at the Greater North Dakota Chamber’s annual policy summit. He warned the audience that South Dakota’s opposition to eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines, which he attributed to the strain of political populism shared by both states, might be “contagious.” 
Jessica Bell, Rainbow Energy vice president and former Republican state lawmaker who moderated the panel discussion, attributed this opposition to “horseshoe politics.”
“The opposition comes not only from those on the far left who frame these projects as perpetuating fossil fuel use, but also from the far right who view them as government overreach,” Bell said. “While these groups rarely agree on much they do converge here in trying to stop development. For conservatives in particular, leadership on energy policy cannot always be simply saying ‘no’ to something and everything.”
Owen pushed back on the idea that property owners “gathered in a barn” and organically built a successful opposition to use of eminent domain. 
“Landowners teamed up with environmental groups, who supplied a lot of money, and they hired damn good political talent,” said Owen, who hopes this is only a “pause” and South Dakota will return to the table down the road. 
Owen was joined on the panel by Brian Kalk, chief research officer at the Energy and Environmental Research Center and a former member of the Public Service Commission, and North Dakota Rep. SuAnn Olson, a Republican from Baldwin.

Olson noted some of the opposition to Summit’s pipeline has been created by mixed messaging from the company and government officials.  The pipeline was “adamantly described,” Olson said, as a way to deliver CO2 to a storage facility in North Dakota. But Summit officials have also said the pipeline could be used in the future for enhanced oil recovery if a customer developed an agreement with Summit. 
Enhanced oil recovery is under development in order to extract a greater percentage of North Dakota’s oil, extending the life of Bakken wells. One technique being researched would use carbon dioxide to repressurize underground reservoirs. Bell noted current estimates require 100 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, far more than is produced in North Dakota, to make it happen. 
The pipeline route permit approved by the North Dakota Public Service Commission specifies that the CO2 would go into permanent underground storage. 
“Even the 100 million tons annually that’s needed is built on lots of assumptions,” Olson said. “None of us, if you want to be accurate, can be sure exactly what that’s going to be and where it’s going to come from.” 
Kalk suggested it was possible for North Dakota and the United States to become “third world countries,” like those he said he visited as a U.S. Marine logistics officer for 20 years. 
“That’s what some of these other countries are because they don’t have progressive thinking about building pipelines, about building a power grid,” said Kalk. “I think North Dakota right now is kind of in that spot where we have done great things, but what’s next?”
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said during a radio interview last week he’s researching what legal options the state could have to challenge South Dakota’s law against eminent domain.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In January 2022, Elmer Waggoner arrived at a hospital with COVID-19. By March 3 he was negative for the virus and died March 29 after developing necrotizing fasciitis from a bed sore.
By then, the state emergency declaration had also expired.
But an attorney for dozens of doctors and three anonymous hospitals argued before the Indiana Supreme Court Thursday that his family’s malpractice suit should be dismissed due to COVID-related immunity.
“The extent of COVID’S causation is it caused him to go to the hospital, and that’s it,” said attorney Arie Lipinski, representing Waggoner’s wife and children. “And defendants are asking this court to extend the immunity statutes, so broadly that just because a patient presents at a hospital with COVID-19, anything after that goes.”
Waggoner’s family filed a malpractice complaint against 86 defendants in March 2023. His treatment spanned several hospitals in Kentucky and Indiana as he was transferred back and forth several times.
A trial court granted summary judgment to the health care providers based on immunity related to the emergency.










Defendants are asking this court to extend the immunity statutes, so broadly that just because a patient presents at a hospital with COVID-19, anything after that goes.


– Attorney Arie Lipinski


The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed in January, finding that the question of whether all or some of the defendants’ services to him for his pressure wound “arose” out of the state disaster emergency hinges upon causation — something a medical review panel should decide.
“To be sure, Elmer was originally hospitalized for COVID-19, and he first developed the wound while prone and ventilated to treat his COVID-19 symptoms, but Waggoner submitted an expert’s opinion stating that Elmer’s death was caused by inadequate treatment of the pressure wound, not by his COVID-19 symptoms,” the appellate decision said.
But that decision conflicts with other immunity-related precedent in Indiana.
Justice Mark Massa said the immunity statutes were common-sense legislative action to not second-guess people working in the midst of an emergency.
“But we had cases of negligence for bed sores long before COVID. Is this the type of alleged malpractice that this statute was intended to immunize?” he asked.
Attorney Colleen Davis argued it is.
“When COVID first came out and when these laws were enacted, this was a disease we didn’t understand. This was a time where health care providers are putting their health and safety, the health and safety of their families, at risk so that they can care for our community. And this was also a time when providers were leaving the medical profession because they were afraid. And so, yes, resources were strapped.”

She added “this was an uncertain time, and I think the legislature really intended to protect those providers that are doing their best to care for our community.”
Chief Justice Loretta Rush noted that the immunity provisions don’t cover gross negligence or willful misconduct. But that wasn’t argued in the original complaint.
Lipinski said causation is key in the case and those are questions for a medical review panel — not a court.
And he noted that between March 3 — the day Waggoner tested negative and the governor rescinded the emergency — and March 29, several defendants treated him only for the necrotizing fasciitis and complications from the bed sore.
But Davis said a medical review panel can’t look at causation — only whether the defendants breached standard of care and whether that breach caused injuries.
“It’s never going to inform anyone as to whether these defendants should be immune,” she said.

Thomas Massie appears to still have an enthusiastic base of supporters in his congressional district. 
Massie earned laughs and applause from a large crowd at a rally in Burlington Wednesday night. It was the final stop of the day for him and Republican Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who travelled throughout Northern Kentucky for a mix of official forums and campaign events. 
Perhaps the clearest sign that Massie is still in good graces with his constituents is the standing ovation he received after announcing he will have the 218 signatures needed to force a U.S. House vote on releasing federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein, a point he reiterated throughout Wednesday’s stops. Though the president campaigned on declassifying the files, Trump has more recently opposed releasing them. 
Amid the president’s repeated threats to oust the seven-term congressman, next year’s GOP primary for Massie’s seat could become a choice between Trump’s brand of governing and the Tea Party movement that helped propel Massie and Paul into office, though no Trump-backed challenger has stepped up.
A Trump-tied super PAC, MAGA KY, spent $1.2 million on ads opposing Massie this summer. The congressman has previously accused one of the PAC’s backers, financier John Paulson, of being in Epstein’s “black book,” and did so again during the rally. A spokesperson for Paulson has denied this and called it “a weak attempt to imply a relationship with Epstein” that doesn’t exist, according to media reports. 
“I do find it interesting that I am leading the charge to release these files, and that one of the three billionaires is among the circle of just a few hundred people who are actually in the phone book of Jeffrey Epstein,” Massie told the crowd.

Massie was also critical of the PAC ads against him, including one that accused him of supporting burning U.S. flags. He said that he once tweeted that he agreed with late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia “that if you have your own flag and you’re on your own property and you’re not infringing on somebody else’s rights, you can burn your flag.” 
“Now, if you burn my flag, I’m going to kick your ass,” Massie said, and the crowd roared with cheers. 
Massie has often been seen as a leader of Liberty Republicans in Northern Kentucky, or GOP politicians who lean more libertarian than the rest of the party. With constituents during stops, he focused on his priorities like eliminating national debt, supporting limited government and not backing foreign aid. 
Like Paul, the son of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul from Texas who led the Tea Party movement, Massie has not been afraid to rub his fellow Republicans the wrong way by opposing budget bills that he considers irresponsible. Speaking ahead of Massie, the senator said he and Massie sometimes incur anger, even from Trump, “because we vote on principle.”
“You have to treat presidents the same. No matter which party they’re in. We have to believe in something bigger than me, bigger than Thomas and, frankly, bigger than Donald Trump,” Paul said. 
Paul said Massie’s upcoming Republican primary in the 4th Congressional District in May will be one of the “biggest elections in U.S. history” because “if they defeat him, they’re defeating all of us.” 
“If Thomas loses, if they have the ability to have three billionaires come down here from New York City and beat him, they defeat the movement,” Paul told the crowd. “It is the end of the Tea Party at that point.”
‘Under Trump’s skin’
Earlier this year, Massie opposed Trump’s bombing of Iran. He voted against the president’s tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for increasing federal deficits and the debt. Trump took to Truth Social in June calling Massie a “simple minded ‘grandstander’” and said he “votes ‘NO’ on virtually everything put before him (Rand Paul, Jr.), no matter how good something may be.” 
Trump vowed to oust Massie with “a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary.” Massie, an MIT-educated engineer who served as Lewis County judge-executive, was elected to Congress in 2012. 
During the rally, Paul said he was ready to endorse Massie and if someone asked about waiting to see who could run against the congressman, “I can’t imagine that they’d even try it.”

Northern Kentuckian Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state who lost the 2010 U.S. Senate primary to Paul, told the Lantern in a phone interview that traveling the district with an ally like Paul is a way for Massie to be “visible” and “remind people who he is” ahead of the primary. 
“He’s very personable, and so getting out and about in the district, reminding people of that fact, and also talking about what’s been going on. He’s talking about the Epstein files and talking about his votes and defending his record. So, I think it’s pretty smart politics to do that and especially right now.”
Wednesday’s stops included rural parts of the congressional district, including forums in eastern counties Greenup and Mason. Massie and Paul connected with the Republican base in Northern Kentucky in Burlington and in Dry Ridge at Beans Cafe and Bakery. The cafe pushed back against restrictions on bars and restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic, gaining support from local conservatives. 
Massie repeated the central points of his messaging throughout the day — strong support of the First and Second Amendments, a love of agriculture, and concerns about a growing national debt. He drew attention to his real-time debt counter, which he had pinned to his jacket for the day and often wears at the U.S. Capitol, by joking that some Democrats ask if it’s his step counter. 
Grayson said Massie “is pretty formidable” in the congressional district. Pushing an issue like releasing the Epstein files could keep Massie “under Trump’s skin” and could still motivate Trump’s political team to recruit a primary opponent.

“But at the same time, it’s also one of those issues that maybe when it’s litigated at a ballot box, it’s actually better for Massie, because he’s on the side of transparency and doing something the public likes,” Grayson said. 
Grayson said he has heard from some Northern Kentucky Republicans who are “old school” and aren’t big fans of either Trump or Massie, but “several of them have said to me that they like Massie standing up to Trump.”
Asked if he thought pushing for the release of the Epstein files would impact his reelection, Massie told reporters at one stop he’s seen polling that shows “80% of Republicans and Democrats want the Epstein files released, and the other 20% don’t care.”
“There is nobody against transparency, except for the folks in Washington D.C., who are taking up for their billionaire friends and politically connected people,” Massie said. “And I think this is about a trust issue. We need to restore trust in the DOJ (U.S. Department of Justice) and in the government, and they need to release the files.”
Later in the day, Massie told the Burlington rally that he does still have praise for the president despite their policy disagreements. Massie even did an impression of Trump while reenacting a phone call between the two of them about Massie’s endorsement in the 2024 presidential election. He added that his presidential impression maybe “wasn’t that good,” but he had still “never disparaged him personally.” 
However, the congressman did warn voters in Burlington that the PAC is going to try to convince them that he isn’t a true conservative and a challenger would have to “sell a lie.” 
“They have to try to convince tens of thousands of people in Kentucky that I’m not conservative,” Massie said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5305-1024x723.jpg,,,2025-09-25 15:57:35.011743

Dan Innis became the first candidate in New Hampshire’s 2026 U.S. Senate race to drop out Thursday, and on his way out he endorsed John E. Sununu, who publicly said he’s considering a run but hasn’t officially launched a campaign.
Innis announced he was suspending his campaign in a statement posted online. He said he ran for the seat “because there was no real Conservative running” and that “Chris Pappas (a Democratic candidate) would be a disaster for our state, and I believe that only a true Republican with unquestionable Conservative credentials can defeat him next November.” However, when Sununu told WMUR he was considering joining the race earlier this month “all of that changed for me in an instant,” Innis said.
Dan Innis
“If Senator Sununu decides to put his name on the ballot, there is no way that I would try and stand in his way,” Innis wrote.
Innis lavished praise on Sununu, who previously represented New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate from 2003 to 2009 and is part of the politically connected Sununu family. He called Sununu “the respected, experienced and trusted Conservative that I was hoping would jump in the race last spring.”
Innis encouraged Scott Brown, the only other Republican in the race, to also drop out and back Sununu. Brown represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013 in the Senate before moving to New Hampshire.
Innis said if Sununu decides not to run, he’ll reactivate his campaign.
Sununu lost reelection to the Senate in 2008 and has remained out of elected office since. He is the brother of Chris Sununu, who served as New Hampshire’s governor from 2017 to 2025 and was widely rumored to be a candidate for this race until he publicly ruled out a campaign in April. His father, John H. Sununu, was governor from 1983 to 1989 and White House chief of staff under President George H.W. Bush.
On the Democratic side of the race, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and progressive organizer Karishma Manzur are seeking the nomination. The race became wide open after current U.S. Sen.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Saying the state’s new limits on ballot initiatives were too great to immediately overcome, Florida Decides Healthcare announced Thursday that it is putting the brakes on efforts to get  a proposed constitutional amendment on Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot and will aim for 2028, instead.
In an interview with the Florida Phoenix, organization Executive Director Mitch Emerson said the new law was passed to sabotage efforts to bring proposed constitutional amendments before voters. The Florida Legislature earlier this year passed HB 1205, which put in sweeping changes nearly immediately.
“As much as anything, it’s really about runway,” Emerson said, adding that the law changed the rules in the middle of the signature campaign effort. 
Florida Decides Healthcare, the political entity created to place Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot, challenged many of the changes in federal court but an appeals court earlier this month lifted an injunction against one of the restrictions that prevented groups from using non-citizens to gather initiative petitions.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature insisted that the restrictions were needed to counter fraud in which people were arrested for turning in petitions that contained the names of dead people or people who never signed them.
Restrictions on constitutional amendment process clears the Florida Legislature

Despite the new restrictions, Florida Decides collected 200,000 petitions, raised more than $6 million, and built a coalition of more than 100 grassroots organizations. In the meantime, Emerson said, it remains committed to its lawsuit against HB 1205, with a full trial scheduled for January. And it’s committed to a three-year plan to set the issue before voters in the 2028 general election.
“We’re going to keep moving forward. We’ve got a plan to expand the coalition in every county, raise the resources, and organize at the scale needed to overcome the barriers that politicians are putting out in our way. And over the next three years, we are going to build the biggest, strongest campaign Florida has ever seen,” he said, adding that a  GSG poll show 67% of Floridians support  Medicaid expansion.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That’s Democrats, Republicans, independents alike. And that makes us confident that when this goes on the ballot in 2028, Floridians will say ‘yes’ at the end of the day. This fight isn’t about the politicians or courtrooms. It’s about Floridians,” Emerson said.
 Health care cliff is coming

While a delay could give Florida Decides a better chance to earn a ballot spot, it comes at a time when residents are at risk of losing their health insurance, Emerson said.
Health insurance premiums are slated to go up for millions of Florida residents, and people nationwide, unless Congress agrees to extend the enhanced advanced premium tax credits for so-called Obamacare health plans. 
The tax credits, established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a massive COVID-19 relief package, were extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost $350 billion to keep them intact over the next decade.
The tandem of the increases in health insurance premiums and lack of a safety net for people will show that health care is a “real crisis in the coming,” Emerson said.
“And it’s not years away. It’s here now, right? We already in Florida are 47th in the nation for health care access. And as it stands today, one in five Floridians are uninsured. When the ACA tax credits expire in January, that’s going to leave more than 3 million Floridians, one in five of us, without health care. 
“That means families devastated, hospitals closing, tens of thousands of jobs and good doctors lost,  fewer options for patients, and higher costs for everyone. Veterans, caretakers, working families will be left without coverage while politicians keep playing games in Tallahassee,” he continued.
“And that’s  why this fight is more urgent than ever,” Emerson said.  “So, over the next, you know, three years, I feel like more people are going to be feeling this impact. Because the estimates of what this will do here in Florida are catastrophic.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Without reading the morning headlines, one might believe Thursday’s Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting was routine, even more tame than usual. The crush of cameras and celebrations outside told a different story.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters dedicated his opening remarks to the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk and went on to present a mostly flat budget proposal for public education next year. 
Walters did not acknowledge his impending resignation from elected office, a bombshell he revealed live on FOX News the night before. He told FOX host Trace Gallagher he would step down from office to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an anti-teacher-union organization founded earlier this year. 
The Teacher Freedom Alliance announced Thursday morning that Walters would start in his new role on Wednesday.
Gov. Kevin Stitt will appoint a replacement to finish Walters’ term through January 2027. Stitt helped launch Walters’ political career when he chose the former high school teacher to be his education secretary, but the two had a public falling out earlier this year.
“I wish Ryan and his family the best in this next chapter,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Oklahoma students remain my top priority, and with my first appointment to this role, I will be seeking a leader who is fully focused on the job Oklahomans expect: delivering real outcomes and driving a turnaround in our education system.”

A spokesperson for the Governor’s Office, Abegail Cave, confirmed Stitt does not yet have a resignation letter from Walters.
Unlike Walters, Oklahomans who showed up to the state Department of Education building Thursday morning didn’t let the occasion pass unacknowledged. His supporters held signs stating “Thank you state Superintendent Ryan Walters” while his critics chanted “bye bye Ry Ry” and raised their arms in victory.
The two groups chirped insults at each other as they waited in line to enter the building, highlighting the polarized political clash that these board meetings have become since Walters took office.
Walters spent his final gathering with the board discussing teacher certification and school administrative matters. Rather than making a splash with headline-grabbing budget requests, like he did last year by asking for $3 million for Bibles, he made a relatively mundane funding proposal to submit to the state Legislature, who will make the final budget decisions. 
He proposed cutting $2.6 million in smaller programs like Imagine Math, Imagine Reading and Great Expectations to help make room for an expected $23.7 million increase in the cost of educators’ health insurance.
The board tabled the budget request to have more time to review it.

A mostly tranquil meeting ended with a heated back-and-forth when a few members questioned why Walters didn’t include more items on Thursday’s agenda after he canceled the board’s August meeting. 
Board member Mike Tinney noted some teacher license revocation cases are on the cusp of being dismissed, and other cases have had no progress for months toward a conclusion.
Walters responded with barbed comments, saying he had decided no cases were ready for a board vote.
“As long as I’m here, it will be my decision of what’s presented to the board, and that’s the way that we’re going to do it,” he said during the meeting. “You guys can sue me, I don’t care. You guys can run for state superintendent, go out and get hundreds of thousands of votes across the state, represent parents and students and teachers. Go for it. Good luck. But as long as I’m in this office, I will be unapologetic about protecting the kids of Oklahoma.”
What no one said was Walters wouldn’t be in office for much longer. 
He quickly left the room after adjournment without speaking to news media. The meeting agenda included no opportunity for members of the public to address him.
Tinney made the only reference to Walters’ resignation during the meeting, telling the superintendent “with all things being said here, I do wish you and your family well.”
“It is my desire that we get, if this really happens, that we get a new state superintendent that genuinely cares for the students and the educators and that will work with the board and that will be ethical and honest,” Tinney told reporters afterward.

Fellow board member Becky Carson echoed Tinney’s optimism that Walters’ departure could mark a more positive beginning.
“I believe that the superintendent’s resignation opens the door for us to now make progress on this board and do what’s best for the children of this state,” she said after the meeting.
Widely considered a potential candidate for higher office, Walters instead is making the rare move to resign from his statewide elected position with more than a year left in his term. He has not announced intentions to launch a political campaign, even to seek reelection.
Recent polling showed his popularity tanked in recent months amid a clash with the state board over nude women being visible on his office TV during a meeting. A law enforcement investigation found the images were from a Jackie Chan movie that accidentally started playing.
Walters also appeared to fall behind in fundraising, with less than $20,000 in his campaign account as of June 30, according to the most recent campaign finance reports available.
If he jumped into the 2026 Republican primary race for governor, he would face heavily-funded opponents, including Attorney General Gentner Drummond and former House Speaker Charles McCall who each reported more than $1 million in their campaign accounts in the first half of the year.
Walters, though, has strong name recognition from constant media coverage and his many appearances on cable TV. He built a national profile as a far-right Republican unafraid to push the envelope.
He was elected in 2022 with a pledge to shake up the education establishment with conservative, parent-focused reforms.
However, national testing revealed Walters’ first two years in office resulted in little to no improvement in Oklahoma’s academic results.

State-based testing in 2024 showed significant leaps in student performance, but Oklahoma Voice uncovered the rising test scores were not the result of genuine academic improvement. Rather, they primarily resulted from the state quietly lowering the bar for students to be considered “proficient” in reading and math.
Instead of acknowledging the state’s stagnant performance, Walters abruptly proposed eliminating state testing altogether. He told reporters expected a “very quick” approval from the Trump administration for the plan.
His comments appeared to backfire. Soon after, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon excluded Walters from her August visit to Oklahoma, signaling a rift with the state superintendent, despite him being a dedicated Trump ally.
Fellow Republicans in Oklahoma have voiced frustrations with Walters during his tenure over his numerous controversies, poor administration of state funds and constant focus on culture-war talking points. Democrats made multiple calls for his impeachment.
House Common Education Committee leader Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, said “it’s been a rough couple of years.”
“Am I happy with where our results are of our kids and our testing or whatever? No, none of us are,” Lowe said while speaking with reporters after attending Thursday’s meeting. “I don’t think anybody watching this right now will think it’s good. We’re working hard to get better.
“This is not going to turn overnight. Doesn’t matter who’s sitting in what chair. This doesn’t turn overnight. It takes all Oklahomans to want to see this better, and we’ll work to do that.”

WILMINGTON, Del. – Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, a pioneer in the Mid-Atlantic craft beer scene, abruptly closed all 16 of its brewpubs on Sept. 25, sending shockwaves through Delaware and beyond. The company announced the shutdown on social media and by email, confirming that every location across Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia is now dark.
The sudden move came just two weeks after Iron Hill shuttered its original Newark, Del., brewpub—opened in 1996—along with sites in Chestnut Hill, Pa., and Voorhees, N.J. Signs posted on doors from Wilmington’s Riverfront to Philadelphia’s Market Street thanked customers for their loyalty and hinted at a possible return. “It has been our pleasure to serve you… we sincerely hope to return in the future,” read one notice.
Financial Strain Behind the Sudden Exit
While the public message was warm, an internal email to employees told a harder truth: “ongoing financial challenges” had left the company no choice but to close and prepare for bankruptcy. Leadership disclosed efforts to secure new funding but said the business could no longer sustain operations. Staff members were reportedly given little notice.
A Delaware Legacy
The loss is particularly painful in Delaware, where Iron Hill’s first location helped spark the state’s craft beer renaissance. Over nearly three decades, the brewery built a reputation for pairing award-winning beers with family-friendly dining, hosting countless community events, and setting the standard for brewpubs across the region. Locations in Newark, Rehoboth Beach, and Wilmington became gathering spots for locals and visitors alike.
Iron Hill’s closure also underscores a challenging environment for Wilmington’s dining scene. The brewery follows the recent shutdowns of other longtime favorites, including Gallucio’s and Ulysses Gastropub, both of which closed their doors earlier this year after decades of service.
What Comes Next
Iron Hill’s statement leaves the door open to a potential revival, but with bankruptcy proceedings underway, any comeback would likely require a major restructuring or new ownership. For now, loyal patrons across five states are left with memories—and a void in their local dining and craft beer scenes.
The closures mark the end of an era for a brand that helped define the region’s brewpub culture and raised the profile of Delaware’s craft beer industry.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-145317.jpg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

A continued effort to propose rules expanding uses for oil and gas wastewater has sparked environment groups to call for the removal of seven commissioners. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several environmental groups opposing a state water board’s oil and gas wastewater rulemaking on Thursday requested the board disqualify seven members and toss votes from earlier this year. The groups said the members’ “impartiality and fairness” were “compromised by interference” from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The Center for Biological Diversity and Santa Fe-based New Energy Economy filed two separate motions requesting the commission address the issue in October, and cited emailed exchanges between members of the governor’s staff and cabinet members before a July meeting in which the board moved forward in efforts to roll back rules limiting expanded wastewater use.
“These commissioners and their subordinates need to be disqualified from this proceeding, that’s really the bottom line,” Colin Cox, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM. “This is not how government is supposed to work — this is not fair, this is not impartial.”
New Mexico governor puts finger on scale in oilfield wastewater vote

Both petitions noted State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard’s support. In an interview Thursday Garcia Richard told Source NM that the office, which leases out more than 2 million acres for oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin, would be impacted by the rules change.
“it’s pretty evident that there is a blatant effort to roll back or reverse the initial decision of the commission. That’s what I’m concerned about,” Garcia Richard said.
She also described a “constant barrage of spills and illegal dumping of produced water that we are dealing with on state land.”
The governor, along with oil and gas industry advocates, has for years cited the state’s limited water supplies as they pursue expanded uses for oilfield wastewater. They have faced pushback from environmentalists, along with the Legislature.
Garcia Richard she’s skeptical about the current science around treating wastewater.
“Until I see something new that has come to light, I’m going to look at this new effort with suspicion,” she said.
A request for comment from the governor’s office remained pending Thursday afternoon, but the office has issued previous statements denying wrongdoing.
The motion to recuse cabinet members from voting on the issue marks the latest development at the Water Quality Control Commission, which is currently reconsidering its own rules limiting the uses of oil and gas wastewater issued in May to the oilfield and specific treatment projects.
The issue was reopened in June, spearheaded by the WATR Alliance, (Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse) which has board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests. The group proposed a new rule that would allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment.
Commissioners — including cabinet secretaries sitting on the board for the first time — voted to move forward with possibly reversing the rule and quashed environmental groups objections in an August meeting.
The motions requesting the mandatory recusal for five secretaries – Environmental Secretary James Kenney, Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie, Department of Game and Fish Director Michael Sloane, State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson and agriculture Secretary Jeff Witte — and two other members: Christopher Moander, chair of the oil conservation commission and the state parks division designee for Toby Velasquez.
“The standard the commission is held to is a very strong standard: they have to be fair and impartial, and if there’s any doubt about that, then they have to recuse themselves,” said Cox. “These emails…make it very hard to trust any of those commissioners, or the people who work for them.”
The motions cited the Water Quality Commission’s recusal requirements, which state that no commissioner “shall participate in any action in which his or her impartiality of fairness may reasonably be questioned,” and goes on to describe that recusal must be public.
A request for comment to the attorney for the WQCC board about board requirements for recusal and disqualification was pending Thursday morning.
WQCC Chair Bruce Thomson, when reached by phone on Thursday, said any comment on the motions themselves would be “premature,” but also noted he has no qualms with the members of the cabinet and their actions taken on the board.
“I have no questions about their service on the commission, or at least I have no questions about their integrity, and their honesty,” he said. “They’re honorable people, they’re dedicated to the state of New Mexico and to public service.”
Thomson said the board would likely set an agenda for the upcoming Oct. 14 meeting of the board next week.
“I suspect we will hear the motions to disqualify,” Thomson said.

The Claremore facility is the last Indian Health Service facility on the Cherokee Nation’s land still operated by the federal government, according to a news release. 
The transfer, signed by Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is effective Oct. 1.  
Hoskin said the transfer is an example of how self governance continues to “transform” the Cherokee Nation. 
“This is more than a transfer of management,” Hoskin said in a statement. “It is a moment in which decisions about health care are being placed directly into the hands of the Cherokee and Native people, the very ones who rely on this hospital most.”
The Cherokee Nation’s health system already handles 2.6 million patient visits per year across 11 health facilities. 
“Tribal Nations know best how to provide culturally appropriate care for their citizens,” Kennedy said.
About $11 million has already been committed by the Cherokee Nation to improve the Claremore facility. Another $244 million has been authorized for a “state-of-the-art replacement facility” that is expected to open in 2027. 
While the new facility suspends operations, the tribe’s health care system will absorb the Claremore area’s inpatient cases, according to a news release. Claremore’s inpatient average was about four patients per day. 
The tribal nation will double its inpatient capacity with a new Tahlequah hospital and the new Claremore health campus will be designed for future expansions. 
Hiring preference was given to employees of Claremore Indian Hospital and 80% who reapplied were offered positions, according to a news release.

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Republican and Democratic parties announced Wednesday that they will hold primary elections to choose their candidates for the upcoming state Senate District 26 special election.
The legislative seat became vacant upon Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s death earlier this month. The Republican from Branch served 16 years in the Legislature and was reelected last year to a term ending in January 2029.
Last week, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave both of the state’s major political parties until Thursday to notify her office whether they would hold a primary election or a convention of delegates to select a candidate for the election to finish Stubblefield’s term.
“It is important that the people of this district have the opportunity to choose their Republican nominee through a fair and open process,” GOP Chairman Joseph Wood said in a Wednesday news release. “A special primary election is the best way to ensure their voices are heard.”
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. As of Thursday, three Republicans and no Democrats have announced their intention to run for the seat.
“We’re looking forward to the mudslinging that we’ll see in the crowded Republican primary field as Gov. Sanders desperately attempts to install a pro-prison rubber stamp in the State Senate,” Democratic Party Chairman Marcus Jones said in a news release.
Republicans Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both Paris businessmen, stated in their campaign announcements that they oppose Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres of land in Franklin County. Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of the proposed prison.
Mark Berry of Ozark, the third Republican candidate so far, did not mention the prison in his campaign announcement. Berry is a military veteran, former adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard and a former two-term state representative who declined to run for reelection last year.

Jones noted in the Democratic Party’s news release that a $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate earlier this year.
“This is Arkansas’s moment to reject corruption and cronyism and deliver a win for common sense and decency,” Jones said. “…From the roads, to the water infrastructure, to the electrical grid, to the non-existent workforce, to the furious voters of Senate District 26, there’s not one good reason to build a brand new billion-dollar prison in Franklin County. That’s what this Special Election will be about.”
Tritt and Simon previously announced their intention to run for the House District 46 seat, soon to be vacated by term-limited Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris. Three other Republicans and no Democrats remain in that primary field so far.
Sanders’ office has yet to announce the dates for the special primary and general elections.

Sept. 3, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMuch has been said about the Michigan House Republican claims about “waste, fraud and abuse” in government and the allegedly bloated budgets the state has produced since the pandemic days of 2020, but for Speaker Matt Hall, the “ghost jobs” issue is a real problem.
The House GOP is hoping the state will adopt some form of its $78.5 billion proposal that contains massive cuts to agencies and programs across the board. At present, those talks remain at a standstill.
One of the major mantras in the House GOP’s budget talks is the caucus’ belief that the state’s agencies have tens of thousands of positions funded in previous budgets, which remain unfilled. Hall (R-Richland Township), House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) and the committee’s vice chair, state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), have repeatedly called those unfilled positions “ghost jobs” and accused the agencies of keeping the money while in an attempt to fund other priorities – all while holding onto “phantom employees.”
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

There has been some discrepancy on how many of those phantom positions exist, but Hall, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said something needs to change and that eliminating the excess dollars in various budgets for employees he says that aren’t there was a good first step.
“We’re entering a post-COVID era, and you’re either going to have to raise taxes to continue this level of government or you’re going to have to go back to what was normal pre-COVID,” Hall said of the GOP’s budget considerations and cuts. “With some of the Medicaid changes, that’s even more real than it might have been before.”
The speaker added that his team’s understanding of “phantom employees” has only grown since they’ve had a chance to dig into the issue through the budget process.
“Every week that goes by we get more information,” Hall said. “When we were coming into this, we thought it was about $500 million and then we realized that it was more like $750 million. So we came out with a number that was our best guess.”
Democrats in both chambers of the Legislature and the various heads of several state departments have said that they are flatly wrong.
State agency heads warn House budget could kneecap operations, harm Michiganders

The Department of State Police has been a major target for cuts to department resources. State Police Director Col. James Grady said last week that $40.2 million in budget cuts proposed by the House, and the slashing of an equivalent 297.5 full time positions for post operations, would be devastating.
The situation has led to accusations from Democrats that House Republicans were the party of defunding the police, which Hall and others have brushed off, saying they are attempting to route budget funding into a public safety trust fund aimed at boosting spending for local law enforcement.
Other department heads or their spokespeople have also said that the House was dealing with bad or outdated information to reach their phantom jobs claims.
Senate Democrats have also chimed in, saying that if the GOP budget team was worth its salt, it wouldn’t interpret the unfilled jobs as a clear example of wasteful spending and taxpayer dollar abuse.

The House Republican calculus on phantom jobs
Information provided to the Advance shows that the House GOP budget team pulled its information from multiple state agency reports.
They include quarterly full-time equivalent jobs reports that multiple departments are legally required to publish on their websites; and annual reports from the state’s Civil Service Commission, showing the backend accounting system.
The quarterly reports look at how many actual employees, or FTEs, each department has in that quarter, but they don’t account for overtime or additional dollars for a given position. For example, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources might have 1,700 employees in the winter time, but in the summertime, they could have double the amount of employees. House leadership posits that as you go through the year, accounting for overtime, the overall number of employees might be somewhere closer to the middle.
As for the annual reports, the House has used those to get more real-time, backend accounting looks at the number of filled and open full-time equivalents the departments have, but those are not quite as official or authoritative as the quarterly reports.
State Police and the Department of Corrections have been targets for House Republican oversight since they took back the chamber in 2024, following two years of a government trifecta. Grady has been called into House Oversight Committee hearings over the last year to touch on a number of issues the caucus has with his leadership of the state’s largest law enforcement agency. Corrections has also seen some pushback from representatives and senators alike when it comes to staffing and security issues.
With phantom jobs in focus, Hall and his team are claiming that Corrections consistently has 600 to 700 unfilled FTEs, not accounting for overtime, and about 2,900 unfilled deputy positions in State Police consistently over the last few years.
Corrections has had significant challenges in terms of staffing and recruiting, despite the department’s best efforts to boost recruitment and try to relieve the department of mandatory overtime shifts, which has affected morale and conditions from the corrections officers down to the prison population itself.
The Advance asked if those unfilled positions in Corrections were more a symptom of the challenges it has faced in recent years than a sign that the department was trying to misuse its funding.
In response, House officials have said that in 2025, according to their accounting, Corrections had 2,700 unfilled positions. Its budget proposal for the next fiscal year pulls out 775 of those positions, and the House appears confident that the department would still have enough wiggle room to hold new corrections classes of 100 recruits each and then use the leftover money to incentivize higher wages.
For State Police, the House GOP has calculated that it had found 738 so-called “phantom jobs,” but is only getting rid of 435 of them in its spending proposal. It has said the cuts would still provide for overtime, two trooper schools in the next fiscal year and give them greater flexibility.
The House considered that the problem might stem from a wage issue in the department for corrections officers, and the same might be true for State Police. That’s why, despite clamouring for the cuts in “phantom jobs,” the House GOP is hoping to give each department close to 20% raises with enough room for recruitment and overtime.

But is it really a fraud?
Calls for state government to mind its budget better have resonated with a wide swath of voters and leaders of all political stripes ad infinitum, but the new GOP ethos of targeting programs it doesn’t like has faced backlash as its leaders – much like Elon Musk and the  Department of Government Efficiency he formerly led – have claimed that those same programs are evidence of fraud and abuse of power.
Such was the mantra for Medicaid cuts at the federal level, and the dismantling of federal influence or involvement in public education.
Still, Hall said there is a legitimate concern when looking at past budgets and the departments’ own reports of seeing money go in for a specific purpose and then not being used for that purpose – in this case, the hiring of additional positions with a range of duties that never materialize.
For the House GOP, even in the best case scenario of the department not using the money for a nefarious purpose, that’s still money sitting in a vault somewhere because of what the caucus claims is a bad accounting process.
That was the House GOP’s most salient argument, the Advance was told, as to why the state doesn’t appear to have money to pay for a long-term $3 billion roads plan or properly fund K-12 and higher education.
There have also been accusations that the state departments have been using those unused funds as a sort of reserve or slush fund that no other previous Legislature was willing to give them as a specific line item.
“The more you comb into it, you can categorize some of this stuff as … gaming it so it looks different than what their intent is,” Hall said.
In the case of State Police, House Republicans claimed that the department is using that money for things like office supplies and building maintenance, whereas the caucus also claims that Corrections has in the past rolled its FTE line into its facility line items.
House leadership is making the case that many of the departments do this and label those efforts to move money around as work projects, but it has been told that both State Police and Corrections don’t do that, and just end up keeping the FTE money and still use it for other purposes.
State Police spokesperson Shanon Banner, in a statement to the Advance, said that all FTEs are critical and the department is constantly working to fulfill them.
Corrections, when asked to respond to the GOP’s claims, deferred comment to the State Budget Office. 
When asked, Lauren Leeds, communications director with the budget office, said: There are no phantom jobs.

The cuts have to come from somewhere, GOP says
As evidenced by public comments from Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) and her appropriations team, the Democrats in the upper chamber aren’t buying what Hall is selling.
Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), in a recent news conference, said that Hall’s assertion that eliminating “phantom jobs” would be a massive fix to state budgeting – and his team’s labeling that as fraud – showed either a “stunning ignorance of basic budgeting, or it’s a deliberate attempt to mislead the public.”
Hall countered by telling the Advance that it shouldn’t be this difficult to eliminate money for positions that he insists aren’t there, and that was one of many reasons why budget talks have stalled. The longer the negotiations go on, or don’t, the GOP claims it has a better understanding of the financial issues that have stymied growth in the state.
“Brinks doesn’t believe there’s any waste, fraud or abuse,” Hall said. “What I’m saying is, if we can’t even cut ghost employees from the budget, then we’re never going to get a roads deal because they’re only going to do tax increases. … They ask for more money than they need and they keep it.”

(Photo courtesy of Kyra Kearse)When Kyra Kearse first visited a pharmacy to pick up free boxes of the overdose reversal drug naloxone, she had a flashback to herself five years earlier, when she was buying drugs and living on the street.
“How many do you want?” the pharmacist asked her in December about naloxone, often known by the name brand Narcan.

“How many can you give me?” Kearse replied.
Kearse, who works with other people in recovery and is approved to distribute large amounts of naloxone, organized Save a Life Day events Thursday in York and Chester counties to hand out free boxes of the medication, which can reverse an opioid overdose.
Originally started in West Virginia, Save a Life Day has grown from two counties in West Virginia to events in every state, including a dozen counties in South Carolina, according to its website.
The event comes as overdose deaths decreased for a second year in South Carolina, though officials have warned that new drugs are deadlier, and some are less responsive or not at all responsive to naloxone.
Many of the organizations participating offer free naloxone throughout the year, organizers said. Save a Life Day, which looks different depending on the county, gives treatment centers and nonprofits a chance to highlight the medication’s significance and correct common misconceptions, organizers said.
The medication is provided free of charge through grants from the South Carolina Opioid Recovery Fund, which is responsible for doling out the more than $360 million the state is expected to receive from a $26 billion settlement legal settlement with three of the nation’s primary drug distributors.
York and Chester counties
Kearse, who lives in Rock Hill, picked up 300 naloxone kits Thursday morning, many of which she will distribute among nonprofits, such as Pathways Community Center and Keystone Substance Abuse Services. The rest, Kearse will offer to people living in homeless encampments, she said.
After spending five years homeless and addicted to drugs, Kearse is intimately familiar with the way addiction and homelessness go hand in hand, she said. Despite the prevalence of addiction among people who are homeless, encampments often lack access to life-saving drugs like naloxone, she said.
“I’ve never seen a drug take away a person’s life the way fentanyl and meth do,” Kearse said. “The devil is at work, but God works harder.”
Kearse also traveled to neighboring Chester County to drop off free naloxone at the Hazel Pittman Center, a nonprofit meant to help treat addiction, she said. Chester County doesn’t have a formal Save a Life Day event scheduled, but the treatment center hosted a conference about how to reduce the use of opioids, which will hopefully mean more efforts year-round, Kearse said.
Charleston County
In Charleston County, nonprofits, law enforcement and county employees planned to hand out naloxone at six different locations, said Sarah Halse, opioid initiative coordinator for the county-run Charleston Center. The county also staged pop-ups in the more rural parts of the county, she said.

The county, which offers naloxone for free all year, has hundreds of kits to give out, Halse said.
“We’re really just out here trying to raise awareness, reduce stigma and educate the community,” Halse said.
Anderson and Spartanburg counties
Palmetto Carolina Treatment Center in Duncan had about 200 boxes of naloxone available for pickup Thursday, and Southwest Carolina Treatment Center in Anderson had about 250, said Candace Latimer, a program director for Carolina Treatment Centers, in an email.
While Save a Life Day is a way to highlight resources such as naloxone, the centers have naloxone available for free every day and are looking for ways to get more of it into the hands of people who might need it, Latimer said.
The centers are also working to raise awareness at local schools, businesses and other community groups about naloxone and what it does, with the goal of continuing to decrease the number of overdose deaths, she said.
“By empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to act in critical moments, we are making strides toward a safer and healthier community,” Latimer said.
Hampton, Jasper and Allendale counties
New Life Center is holding off on its official event in Hampton County until Saturday to align with Varnville’s Celebrating Small Town America Festival, said Emily Ginn, a peer support specialist for the addiction recovery service.

The group wanted to go where people would already be, Ginn said. The Save a Life Day distributions will be part of a larger resource fair involving other nonprofits offering different sorts of help, she said.
People visiting for other resources can then pick up some naloxone and pass on the goodwill, Ginn said.
“If Narcan isn’t the way to help save your life, it could be the way to save someone else’s life, and the next thing could be the way to save your life,” Ginn said. “We all have struggles.”
Ginn will bring 78 boxes of naloxone, with the goal of handing out all of them. She also helped organize distributions in Allendale and Jasper counties, also under New Life Center’s service area, last weekend at similar resource fairs.
Between the two counties, the outpatient service center handed out nearly 100 naloxone kits, an impressive number for the small, rural communities, Ginn said.
Already, that’s more than quadruple what New Life Center gave out last year during its inaugural Save a Life Day, which Tropical Storm Helene forced the center to reschedule, she said.
‘There’s still hope’
Save a Life Day carries personal significance to Ginn, who has been in recovery for four years after 20 years of active addiction. Although she never had naloxone used on her, she saw it save friends’ lives during overdoses, she said.

When people don’t want to take a naloxone kit because of the stigma around drug use or because they think it enables addiction, telling them her own history of addiction often helps change their mind, she said.
Having naloxone on hand and not needing it is better than needing it and not having it, Ginn and other organizers said. And it doesn’t enable anything but breathing in a person having an overdose, they said.
There’s no saying what might be a person’s tipping point that causes them to get sober, Ginn said. Addicts are people, too, and their lives are worth saving, she added.
Seeing people in every state committed to giving out free naloxone “means there’s still hope in our society and our nation,” Ginn said. “I don’t think I’ve ever been a part of something so big.”
Ginn never saw herself working in addiction recovery, but after three years working for the same treatment center where she was once a patient, she’s striving to do everything she can to help people in similar situations, she said.
“It just fills my heart with so much joy because there’s that chance of someone’s life being saved who is where I was at,” Ginn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9594-scaled-e1758822283854-1024x639.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

Judge William E. Smith’s 45-page decision issued this week orders FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security to release funds for more than 50 programs because the decision to withhold them from so-called sanctuary states was “arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.”
Smith wrote that the financial pressure on states to comply or lose irreplaceable federal funding “goes well beyond ‘relatively mild encouragement’ … and amounts instead to ‘economic dragooning.’”
“The record shows that states rely on these grants for billions of dollars annually in disaster relief and public safety funds that cannot be replaced by state revenues,” Smith wrote. “Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed.”
Connecticut was one of 20 states that filed the federal lawsuit in May in Rhode Island, alleging that the withholding of funding was not only impacting the state’s ability to respond to disasters but also to other vital programs involving responses to mass shootings, wildfires and cybersecurity threats.
The judge approved the states’ motion for summary judgment.
“You cannot play politics with disaster relief. Not with lives and communities on the line. We sued, and this decision is a decisive victory for public safety and our sovereign states,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a press release Thursday.
“This decision states unequivocally that Donald Trump’s baseless actions were once again arbitrary and capricious … and that he had zero authority to override the will of Congress. We’re going to keep fighting and we’re going to keep winning to stop Trump from defunding our states,” Tong added.
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement Thursday that “the Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and no lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
“Radical sanctuary politicians need to put the safety of the American people first—not criminal illegal aliens. Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” McLaughlin said.
In February, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum titled “restricting grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions.” A FEMA administrator at the time identified only 12 of 53 programs where the government could lawfully withhold funding from sanctuary states, but despite that, DHS revised its policy to include all federal programs covered by FEMA and DHS, according to the lawsuit.
After the lawsuit was filed, the government revised the initial order twice to say only 13 of 53 programs would be under DHS review regarding assistance in immigration cases. In arguing against the summary judgment motion, attorneys for the Department of Justice argued the lawsuit was now “moot” because the order had been rolled back and the remaining 13 programs were still under review. 
But Smith ruled the “partial rescission cannot moot the controversy where the government continues to assert the authority to enforce the challenged policy.”
“DHS still asserts it was authorized to impose these immigration-related conditions, continues to publish them in its standard terms, and has not issued amended agreements to plaintiff states reflecting any exemption,” Smith wrote.
“Since 2021, Connecticut has received more than $1.2 billion from FEMA to prevent, protect against and respond to flooding and other natural disasters, terrorism, mass casualty events and other catastrophes,” Tong said in a press release. “These conditions would also damage the carefully built trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to promoting public safety.”

Chelsea Boxwell, 42, was charged Sept. 3 in 5th District Court with misusing public money and theft, both second-degree felonies. Details of the charges in that case are sealed; a probable cause statement filed in connection to a separate case said that Boxwell told investigators she had taken “some of” the building permit payments and used them for “bills, child expenses, and other things.”
That separate case, filed Sept. 5 charging Boxwell with theft, a second-degree felony, alleges that when Boxwell spoke to authorities about the building department investigation she told them she had also taken money from a property management company she worked for part time, and was paying it back. Bank records from 2022-2024 showed Boxwell deposited $119,609 in checks to herself, investigators wrote in the probable cause statement.  
Boxwell’s attorney declined to comment on the case.

Utah State Auditor Tina Cannon in a statement issued Wednesday praised the whistleblower who used the hotline to report the money missing from the Iron County Building Department.
“With that information, our Office was able to initiate our limited review, bring additional facts to light, and ensure proper safeguards were implemented going forward. Our role is not only to identify weaknesses, but also to help counties and cities strengthen their systems so public money is protected,” Cannon said.
The review notes that hotline tips are the most common and effective way that misuse of public funds is exposed. The State Auditor’s Office will use what it has learned in Iron County to train other entities, the news release says.
According to the review by the State Auditor’s Office, the building department’s office manager submitted spreadsheets to the Iron County Auditor’s Office for monthly reconciliation rather than proper records. The report also found that the county auditor did not account for missing permit numbers from the sequence listed on the spreadsheets. 
When first notified about the misused funds, the Iron County Auditor’s Office reviewed only the spreadsheets, failing to uncover the missing money, the review found.
Additionally, the report found the building department was depositing the cash payments it received just once a week, while Utah Code requires funds be deposited at least once every three banking days.
Auditors also reviewed receipt practices for nine Iron County departments, finding two of them — the building department and the County Events Center — at higher risk for misused funds. 
In its response, the Iron County Board of Commissioners acknowledged the department’s insufficient reconciliation process, saying the auditor’s office was previously unaware of the software system the county uses to log permits and deposits, but is now using the program.
The commissioners also wrote that steps are being taken to improve receipt practices and to deposit funds twice weekly.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina AFL-CIO president Braxton Winston II, a longtime Democratic activist in Charlotte, said he will fight for the rights of all workers regardless of political affiliation and sees opportunities for cooperation with the Republican-controlled General Assembly.
“You’re going to have a disproportionate level of investment to the upside in industry, both emerging industries as well as legacy industries, in North Carolina,” Winston said in an interview with NC Newsline. “I look forward to working with whoever is going to come to the table to make this state the number one state for both businesses and workers.”
Those initiatives could include helping to bring energy, transportation, and infrastructure investments into the state and advancing workforce development programs to match that growth, he said.
Winston, 42, was elected to lead the NC AFL-CIO at its Wilmington convention on Sept. 12, as longtime labor leader MaryBe McMillan departs the role. He won the election with roughly 86% of the vote against Rodney Hughes, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 3607.
A member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a union stagehand and grip, Winston said that he ran for NC AFL-CIO president at McMillan’s urging.
“When I got the phone call and she was retiring, I was taken aback, like everybody else around the world. I was also taken aback when she suggested I think about this position,” Winston said in his convention speech. “As it was said yesterday, over and over again, you saw something in me that I didn’t necessarily see in myself, so thank you for that.”
‘Determination to fight back’

	
 McMillan, the first woman to serve as the state federation’s president, said she put an emphasis on building a “leaderful movement” during her time in office, working to welcome a wide variety of voices into the labor cause and helping them build the skills to become the best advocates the can be. “It’s really important to create opportunities for new leaders to emerge — this movement needs to build a movement for the future,” she said.
An officer of the NC AFL-CIO for 20 years and president for the past eight, McMillan said she’s proud to have helped achieve “major organizing victories” in her time in leadership.
In an interview with NC Newsline, she pointed to the Duke Graduate Student Union getting its first contract with the university just this year — after two years of negotiating and roughly a decade of organizing. And during the pandemic,  the NC AFL-CIO helped back successful union efforts among workers at Smithfield Packing in Tar Heel and nurses at Mission Hospital in Asheville.
“All those campaigns, they were able to win because they built a movement,” McMillan said. “It wasn’t just about the union, it was about how this would also benefit the community in terms of like, with Mission Hospital, that they’re advocating for better health care, lower staff-patient ratios, and they really built a coalition.”

Stepping down amid significant strife between unions and the federal government, she said she is “really encouraged” by the fire she’s seen from federal workers. Crackdowns on their unions and rights are fueling workers’ determination to fight back, McMillan said.
“I think there’s a real determination that even though we’re facing all these attacks, especially on the federal level, that we can make a difference, and now is the time more than ever for us to stand up and fight,” she said. “It’s on the one hand a challenging moment, but it’s also a real moment of opportunity.”
One of McMillan’s signature achievements was a successful resolution at the 2022 AFL-CIO convention urging labor leaders to invest in the South, where labor organizing has historically faced significant obstacles. The AFL-CIO’s national president, Liz Shuler, praised McMillan for working to create that focus on the South.
“It’s taken some time to get everything in place, but we are following through, and now everyone sees what you have seen for years, that there is a massive, massive opportunity to organize here in the South,” Shuler said.
McMillan said she will remain on to aid Winston in the transition for the next month and will continue to act as a labor advocate in her post-presidential life.
‘I decided to put my body on the line’
Coming into leadership as the labor movement faces some of its greatest challenges of the 21st century is an opportunity that excites Winston, even as he will be forced to confront the federal government head-on.
“In some cases, it seems to be an existential threat to unions and certainly is an attack on workers, period,” Winston said. “I take heed to the wins and losses that have occurred during many precarious times to understand that solidarity is the path forward, and sometimes those forces that seem to beat us down have ways of driving working people closer together.”
He is no stranger to resistance against the government, particularly in the Trump era. Winston drew national attention in 2016 after the fatal shooting by police of Charlotte man Keith Lamont Scott, which sparked citywide protests. A photo of Winston standing up to riot police, fist raised, as they fired tear gas into the crowd went viral, and he won election to the Charlotte City Council the following year.

“When a man was killed waiting for his kids to get off the school bus, I had to show up,” he said at the convention. “I decided to put my body on the line, I had decided to use my voice to speak up for others — largely because of the lessons I had been learning as I entered this movement.”
After concluding his term as a council member in 2023, Winston was nominated by the Democratic Party for labor commissioner in the 2024 election and earned 47.2% of the vote, though lost to Republican Luke Farley by 5.6 percentage points.
“As I was going around the state over the past two previous years running for commissioner of labor, what I’ve learned is that a lot of people don’t know what unions actually are in this state,” Winston said in the interview. “They only understand what they’ve heard — they’ve only been told that they should be afraid of unions.”
Part of the problem, Winston said, is a reticence among Democratic Party leadership to stand up for workers’ rights, a failure that struck him throughout the 2024 elections as he sought the labor commissioner’s office.
“To be completely honest, the Democratic Party leadership did not invest in talking about worker issues. They didn’t want to talk about fair pay, worker safety, and workers’ rights,” he said. “But the labor movement at the leadership of MaryBe had a comprehensive plan on how to do that, and I felt those effects all across the state as I traveled.”
In a state with the lowest union participation rate in the U.S. at just 2.4%, building a successful labor movement can be a herculean task. But, Winston said, “there’s nothing more American than the idea of a union — it says it right there in the preamble of the Constitution.”
“We all work for somebody, and we understand that if work together and collectively, we can have better leverage over our bosses and managers,” he added. “Going and having those conversations, educating people about what labor is all about, is an important thing.”
He added that it was “excellent” to see political leaders in the state join union organizers at this year’s convention and give remarks backing labor rights — most prominently Gov. Josh Stein and state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs.
“The ability to garner political power is certainly important and we’re going to look to do that all across this state, whether that’s in state government or in our local halls of government as well. Everybody can be partners to this,” Winston said.
The midterm elections will be a focus for the union, Winston said, but for now his priority is learning the “nuts and bolts” of leading the state’s largest labor federation from McMillan during the transition period.

(Hart Van Denburg/CPR, pool)Colorado’s largest electric utility announced Wednesday that it had agreed to settle a lawsuit over its alleged role in the most destructive wildfire in state history.
Xcel Energy’s announcement of the $640 million settlement came one day before the start of a civil trial in Boulder County District Court, where thousands of homeowners, businesses and insurers impacted by the 2021 Marshall Fire had filed a lawsuit seeking damages from Xcel and two telecommunications companies.
The Marshall Fire killed two people and destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in Louisville, Superior and unincorporated areas of Boulder County after igniting on Dec 30, 2021. Fueled by dry conditions and high winds, the fire’s destructive path through densely populated suburban neighborhoods in midwinter put a spotlight on heightened wildfire risks brought on by climate change.

Investigators with the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office later determined that the fire had been caused by two different ignition points located roughly half a mile apart: a burning debris pile on a property owned by the Twelve Tribes religious group, and an unmoored Xcel Energy power line. The two fires quickly merged together, and the combined blaze grew to over 6,000 acres in size. No criminal charges were filed in connection with either ignition source.
In an investor filing Tuesday, Xcel said that it “did not admit any fault, wrongdoing or negligence in connection with these settlement agreements.”










For some, the trauma and financial losses remain incredibly difficult. It is our hope that any settlement will allow all those impacted to continue to recover and rebuild.


– Michael Dougherty, Boulder County district attorney


“Despite our conviction that (Xcel) equipment did not cause the Marshall Fire or plaintiffs’ damages, we have always been open to a resolution that properly accounts for the strong defenses we have to these claims,” Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said in a press release.
“We recognize that the fire and its aftermath have been difficult and painful for many, and we hope that our and the telecom defendants’ contributions in today’s settlement can bring some closure for the community,” Frenzel added.
More than half of the settlement amount will come from Xcel’s insurance coverage, the company said, and ratepayers will not be forced to cover any of the remaining cost.
Total damages from the fire were estimated at over $2 billion.
“Thousands of people suffered devastating losses from the Marshall Fire,” Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a statement. “For some, the trauma and financial losses remain incredibly difficult. It is our hope that any settlement will allow all those impacted to continue to recover and rebuild.”

Ron DeSantis may ask the Legislature for an additional $4 million to maintain a warehouse in Lakeland for the state’s Canadian Prescription Drug Importation Program. 
The Agency for Health Care Administration seeks the support in its legislative budget request for state fiscal year 2025-26. Florida law requires agencies to submit spending requests that can serve as a sneak peak of what the governor will include in his recommended budget for the coming year.
Without the annual $4 million bump, “AHCA would be unable to implement the program as directed by the Legislature and no longer have the infrastructure required to support the Program,” the agency wrote in its budget request.

Florida was  the first state to gain approval to import prescription drugs from Canada when the Food and Drug Administration gave the state the green light in January 2024 for a two-year pilot project.
But it continues to face delays in implementation.
AHCA is required to submit a report annually to the Legislature and the governor’s office with a lengthy list of data requirements and documentation showing “the program provides cost savings to the state on imported prescription drugs. “
The Florida Phoenix requested a copies of annual reports from 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 but the agency did not respond.
The $4 million request coincides with the Lakeland Ledger’s dive into the payments the DeSantis administration has made to LifeScience Logistics, which holds the contract with the state to administer the yet-to-be implemented program.
Four years after LifeScience Logistics built a warehouse in Lakeland, the Ledger reported the “facility is a quiet place.” The lack of activity belies a financial footprint that shows LifeScience Logistics received $77.2 million in fiscal year 2025. That was a sharp increase from the $51.7 million the company collected for the contract between fiscal years 2021 through 2024.
“Since July 1, the start of fiscal year 2026, the state has paid the company $3.7 million. That includes three deposits on Sept. 2 totaling $1.3 million for construction services,” the Ledger reported.
Alex Azar is chairman of the board for LifeScience Logistics. Azar served as U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services under Trump’s first administration.
 Medicaid survey

AHCA’s request also shows that the state wants a baseline analysis of its Medicaid population’s health and social services “to support informed policy decisions and allocation of resources to support individual Medicaid enrollees on their path towards stability, economic self-sufficiency, and graduation from enrollment.”
There were 4.07 million people enrolled in Florida’s Medicaid program in August 2025, the latest available data. Florida’s top economists routinely meet to analyze Florida Medicaid data and to project costs, utilization, and enrollment trends. The group, known as the Social Services Estimating Conference, examines Medicaid costs with the exception of those related to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
The budget narrative says AHCA would competitively procure the $3.5 million contract.
 Network provider audits

AHCA relies on Medicaid managed care plans to care for the majority of people in the safety net program. The August data show 2.96 million enrolled in some sort of state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan.
The plans are required to maintain a network of providers to meet the health care access standard set by the state. Plans must establish and maintain an accurate and complete electronic database of contracted providers, locations, and hours of operation, plus specialty credentials, among other things. Each managed care plan is required to submit quarterly reports to the Agency identifying the number of enrollees assigned to each primary care provider.
In its budget narrative, AHCA says it needs $6.8 million to hire an outside vendor to audit the provider networks “and any other activities to verify provider networks as identified by the Agency.”
Unlike other spending proposals, that $6.8 million isn’t coming from public coffers, per se. “The managed care plans will pay the Agency for the expenses of the vendor’s network review, at the rates established by the Agency, proportionate to the managed care plan’s enrolled population. The Agency will then transfer payment to the vendor for services rendered,” the budget notes.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-25 17:32:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials sign agreement with NRC over handling of nuclear materials,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/25/ct-nuclear-regulatory-commission-materials-handling/,"Federal commission will delegate the oversight of radioactive materials used in medicine, academics and industry to officials in Connecticut.","Gov. Ned Lamont signed an agreement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday that will delegate oversight of radioactive materials used in medicine, academics and industry to state officials in Connecticut.
The agreement expands the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s current authority to regulate radiation-emitting devices such as X-rays and CT scans — which are typically the purview of the states — to also include radioactive substances such as tracers used to detect cancer or cracks in underground water pipes.
Radioactive material used in nuclear power plants, as well as its subsequent waste, will continue to be regulated and overseen by federal authorities at the NRC.  
During a signing ceremony in the state Capitol on Thursday, NRC Chairman David A. Wright said the agreement eliminates duplicative regulations and allows professionals who work with nuclear materials to coordinate directly with state regulators to ensure proper handling and disposal.
“You know your people better than we do, and they know you,” Wright said. “So there’s that trust factor built in.”
Lamont, meanwhile, pitched the agreement as part of his administration’s efforts “to be a little more business friendly, and speed things up and make them happen.” 
Connecticut is the 40th state to enter into such an agreement with the NRC covering nuclear materials. Two other states, Indiana and West Virginia, have also signaled their intent to sign similar agreements.
DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said there are over 100 business in Connecticut handling nuclear materials that will benefit from the agreement. “Connecticut will be able to streamline processes and increase efficiency, all while maintaining the highest safety standards,” she said.
As part of the agreement, Dykes said that the NRC will continue to monitor and provide support and training for the state-run program. 
As part of the agreement, Connecticut will begin collecting roughly $1.7 million in annual revenue from license fees that previously went to the NRC to fund its regulatory efforts, according to Jeff Semancik, director of DEEP’s radiation division.
In order to take on additional duties required by the agreement, Semancik said the radiation division has already hired one additional staff member and plans to bring on two more, bringing its total number of employees to 15. Currently, Semancik said the division’s work includes hospital inspections, emergency management and responding to any incidents at Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Waterford.
Connecticut first signaled its intent to enter into an agreement with the NRC in 2020, and Dykes said that formalizing the deal required several years of planning, drafts and adjustments to state law.
DEEP staff, she added, have received “thousands of hours” of training from their federal counterparts in licensing, inspection and enforcement of the rules pertaining to nuclear material handling.
The agreement formally takes effect on Oct. 1, when Connecticut assumes its regulatory authority from the NRC.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6570-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-25 13:57:32.242548

Sanchez is a member of Make the Road Connecticut, an immigrant advocacy organization, and Hartford Deportation Defense. He has testified in front of Connecticut lawmakers in support of expanding HUSKY to unauthorized immigrants.
The crowd, holding signs and chanting, listened as 19-year-old Victor Sanchez Jr. and 17-year-old Silvana Sanchez talked about their father. 
“I’m really mad right now because I’m not only losing my dad, but I’m losing my best friend as well,” said Silvana Sanchez. 
Silvana said her father encouraged her when she was frustrated with school, telling her that he’d come to the U.S. so his children could have a better life. She said her parents are the reason she’s working toward her dream of becoming a nurse. 
Her brother, Victor Sanchez Jr., said he sometimes helped his father with his contracting business, working on apartments. 
“He’s [been] taken away, and all that work that he has was for nothing. His dream was to start a business, and he did, but yet his dream is probably getting taken away,” said Victor Jr. 

Teresa Quintana, an organizer at Make the Road Connecticut, speaks and leads chants at a protest outside the Abraham A. Ribicoff Federal Building and Courthouse on September 24, 2025. Activists from immigrants’ rights organizations gathered at the courthouse in protest of the detention of activist and community member Victor Sanchez earlier that afternoon. 
Sanchez arrived in the U.S. in 2004. A native of Mexico, he has three children — Victor Jr., Silvana, and a 2-year-old son, all of whom are U.S. citizens. 
According to the Connecticut Judicial Branch records, Sanchez was arrested for driving under the influence in 2019 and sentenced to probation, which he completed in 2020.
But Constanza Segovia, co-founder of Hartford Deportation Defense and organizing director of CT for All, said that Sanchez had joined Alcoholics Anonymous, found recovery, and become a fixture in the community. 
“ He not only has gone through recovery and becomes sober himself, but he has been a leader in local groups and has supported many, many other people,” Segovia said. 
Sister Margarita Castañeda of the Congregation of Notre Dame said Sanchez was very active in his church, Our Lady of Sorrows in Hartford. “He showed his leadership right from the beginning,” she said.
“When I arrived, there was nothing to Our Lady of Guadalupe,” added Castañeda, referring to the Catholic image of the virgin Mary that has become the patroness of the Americas and Mexico. “Now we have Mass, we have Novenas, we have gatherings, but I don’t think we can do it this year. Our people are too afraid, and that frightens me.”
According to Segovia, Sanchez had a pending immigration case and had been complying with all the requirements brought forward by the court. 
“Victor has been following every single rule that this building has put in front of him. Every single rule. He has shown up, every time. He has done everything asked of him,” she said. 
Jacob Pudlin, co-chair of the Greater Hartford Democratic Socialist Alliance and a volunteer with Hartford Deportation Defense, said he had accompanied Sanchez to his six-month check-in with immigration officials that afternoon. He said he witnessed Sanchez be placed in handcuffs and taken away by five people. 
ICE officials did not return a request for comment.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, and Hartford City Councilman Josh Michtom were also present outside the courthouse. Michtom called on his fellow city council members and state lawmakers to do more to stop ICE from detaining residents. 
Segovia also reiterated activists’ calls for new state laws that would make it more difficult for the federal government to access immigrants’ data, would prevent ICE agents from accessing state courthouses and allow people to attend court hearings remotely.
Sanchez’s attorney, Glenn Formica, said in a statement read by Segovia that he had filed a request to delay Sanchez’s deportation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Silvana-and-Victor-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

(Courtesy of Gary Stone)LINCOLN – An updated report on the impact of climate change in Nebraska says the state continues to get noticeably warmer and wetter.
The legislatively ordered report also concludes that predictions made in the last State Climate Report in 2014 – that the state was headed toward a climate more like Oklahoma – were spot on.
The 312-page report, authorized by the Nebraska Legislature in 2022 and submitted on Wednesday, predicts increased stress on the state’s water resources, particularly increased irrigation demand as growing seasons expand and more water evaporates from the soil and crops.
“Nebraska stands at a crossroads of experiencing and addressing the challenges climate change brings,” the report begins.
At a seminar detailing the document last week, State Climatologist Deb Bathke said the consensus among climate scientists that humans are contributing to faster heating of the planet has moved from theory to an established fact.

“There is no debate among scientists that climate change is happening,” Bathke told those attending the presentation at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Hardin Hall.
According to the report, produced by Bathke and 20 other “lead” authors, “Reputable climate scientists worldwide continue to be in near unanimous agreement (greater than 99%) that human influences have warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.”
“Furthermore,” the report said, “the speed of the changing climate exceeds what can be attributed to natural variability.”
Eric Hunt, an assistant extension educator of agricultural meteorology and climate resilience at UNL, illustrated that by saying 1990 was once ranked as having the 8th warmest summer since 1890. It’s now ranked the state’s 30th warmest, he said, after so many record-breaking summers since.
“September is more August like,” Hunt added, though the early part of the month was an exception.
Overall, he said, cold winter temperatures are arriving later in the season, and there has been more precipitation at “the wrong time,” during spring planting season, delaying crucial activity.
The new State Climate Report, funded via bipartisan legislation sponsored by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, a Democrat, and then-State Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican now serving in Congress, is a more comprehensive update of the state’s first climate impact report in 2014.
Chapters examine the impact of climate change on water resources and agriculture – the state’s top industry – but also on energy, human health and faith and Indigenous communities. Each chapter presents “gaps and needs.”
The report also includes supplemental recommendations from an independent, science-based consultant from Minnesota, paleBLUEdot, a group that worked on Omaha’s climate plan, about what can be done to mitigate and address climate change.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Among the report’s takeaways:
* Statewide annual temperatures are expected to rise by 5 to 6 degrees by 2050 compared to 1951-2014, and by 7 to 11.5 degrees by the end of the century.
* Summer and fall will warm slightly more than winter and spring, leading to more frequent and prolonged heat extremes.
* Extremely hot days, 90 degrees and hotter, will multiply two to four times, while extremely warm nights of 70 degrees or more could increase tenfold or more.
* Extreme precipitation events, particularly the most intense ones, are expected to rise in frequency and magnitude.
* By the end of the century, if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t reduced, the state could see more than 50 days a year with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.
* Higher temperatures and drier conditions are leading to more extreme wildfires, which burn longer. The worst year in state history for those was 2012, burning 500,000 acres. The second worst was 2022, with 250,000 acres blackened, including the national forest at Halsey.
* The average number of winter days with at least 1 inch of snow on the ground has decreased statewide, with the biggest change hitting the Norfolk area, which was down to 48 days in recent years compared to 63 from 1951 to 1980.
* Agriculture faces more risks from rainfall variability, shifts in rainfall seasonality, more rapid drought development and intensification, rising temperatures, fewer very cold days (which help control pests) and heightened risks of wildfires and hail.
“These factors could significantly reduce agricultural output if unaddressed,” the report warned.
Nebraska climate report delayed to allow for ‘revisions’ and ‘further vetting’

Strategies to maintain productivity, the report said, include advancements in plant genetics, diversification of crops and cropping systems and improved soil and water management practices.
Overall, “decreasing greenhouse gas emissions can avoid climate change’s most significant changes and impacts,” the report said.
The consultant, paleBLUEdot, pointed out that Nebraska received a $307-million federal EPA grant to implement mitigation steps outlined in a 2024 Priority Climate Action Plan done by the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment.
Those steps include adopting a statewide strategy for groundwater recharge, improving management of soil health, utilizing more filter strips along streams, planting more native turf and landscape plants, increasing water conservation education and providing funds for conservation easements. The consultant also suggested “decarbonizing” Nebraska energy generation and moving to 100% renewable energy by 2040.
Bathke, the state climatologist, told those attending the climate change seminar last week that she plans to take the report “on the road” to help Nebraskans understand it.
The consultant also recommended that the state develop a “Climate Mitigation and Resilience Plan” to help Nebraska deal with the challenges ahead.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The state of Idaho’s massive overhaul of its business and accounting software in 2023 led to a number of errors on financial statements and weaknesses in processes for ensuring accuracy of those statements, a legislative audit found. 
The findings included reported financial misstatements of hundreds of millions of dollars for some agencies, duplicated payments, and a lack of processes to verify accuracy of statements between the State Controller’s Office, Idaho State Treasure’s Office, and the bank — many of these issues have been reported previously by the Idaho Capital Sun. 
The financial reporting errors don’t necessarily mean agencies spent more or less than they had, but problems could arise in the state budgeting process or potentially affect the state’s credit rating, Idaho lawmakers told the Sun. 
The state is required to submit an Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and audit of the entire state budget each year. This year’s report detailed fiscal year 2024 — which ran July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024 — and thus included some of the results of a bumpy implementation of the software, called Luma. 
The report is scheduled to be discussed at a Legislative Council meeting at 8:30 a.m. Friday at the state Capitol in Boise.

The co-chairs of Idaho’s budget-writing committee, the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, both said the report was concerning, but noted there are efforts underway to fix issues identified in it. 
“It’s problems like that that make the budgeting process difficult,” said co-chair Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls. “If we can’t rely on these numbers to be accurate, the budgeting process gets complicated real quick.” 
Co-chair Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who is also a retired certified public accountant, said he was most concerned about the lack of process for reconciliation — ensuring the accounting system’s cash numbers matched the bank’s records. According to the report, amid the implementation of Luma, this process was no longer being completed for some categories of cash. 
“When there’s an uncertainty in cash, it puts a level of uncertainty about the overall financial statements,” Grow said. 
The State Controller’s Office pays the state’s bills and the Idaho Treasurer’s Office holds cash for the state. The system changeover caused hurdles in verifying agency fund balances for the Treasure’s Office, the Sun reported in 2024.
“As with any change in financial systems, there’s always a challenge in the first year, but also recognizing that, for the state of Idaho, each year that these audits are conducted, there’s always a series of findings, so it’s not abnormal,” Scott Smith, chief deputy controller and Luma Division administrator, told the Sun in an interview. “And certainly from the Controller’s Office perspective, we appreciate the due diligence from the Legislative Services Office to make sure that we’re following the appropriate rules and have the right controls in place, and anything they do find is really an opportunity for us to continue to improve and do better.” 
The Idaho State Treasurer’s Office could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 What made this Luma report so significant? 

The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report is more than 200 pages long, and this year’s audit includes what are called “qualified opinions,” which means the finding was significant enough that there could be a material error in reporting, largely because the documentation wasn’t adequate for auditors to verify accuracy. 
Legislative Services Office Audit Division Manager April Renfro told the Sun that in her 13 years in the position, she had never issued a qualified opinion before. There were eight qualified opinions in this report. 
Renfro’s follow-up report on internal controls, which detailed errors found by auditors, had 18 findings, including 11 “material weaknesses,” which are failures in internal processes that make it possible staff would be unable to prevent financial misstatements.

The discontinuation of the reconciliation process for cash balances by fund amid the launch of Luma on July 1, 2023, was one of the findings; this resulted in reports of unverified cash amounts in statements and errors going undetected. 
 “That’s the biggest problem, in my mind,” Grow said.
Grow said it’s important for an organization to not rely on the bank to know how much money it has, which is what happens without internal reconciliation. 
Horman echoed Grow’s concerns. 
“It’s troubling that (the State Controller’s Office) thought that we could get by without a reconciliation process,” she said. “That, to me, is the most disappointing part of this.” 
Because of challenges in having the needed reports available, the Controller’s Office has implemented a manual process for reconciliation, Smith said, and is in the process of creating a more streamlined automated process. 
“As we become more familiar, and our process has become more mature, on getting that knowledge across all of our agencies then that helps frame, ‘what does that automation look like?’ And ‘what should it be?’” Smith said.

 What were some of the errors found in the Luma audit? 

One of the financial statements provided by the Controller’s Office did not include the value of federal money received and spent for the food benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, resulting in a misstatement of $280.9 million. 
Grow noted that misstatements in financial reporting don’t necessarily mean agencies thought they had more or less money to spend, but the errors call into question the reliability of financial statements. 
Auditors identified more than $30 million in duplicate payments made to Medicaid providers in November 2023, an issue that was reported by the Idaho Freedom Foundation at the time; the error wasn’t discovered until providers called the state to ask about the extra payment, the report said. 
Auditors found other incidents of duplicate, sometimes triple, payments in fiscal year 2025, the report said, but those payments were not recorded in Luma so there was “no way to track them through the accounting system.” The Treasurer’s Office tracked the payments through a manual process using a spreadsheet, the report said. 
“Additionally, when the (Controller’s) Office was questioned about instances beyond the two incidents, we were aware of, it stated that only ‘one or two, here and there’ were seen,” the report said. “This did not instill confidence that additional errors had been detected or prevented.” 
The Controller’s Office in its response agreed with the findings, and said the office had implemented automatic checks to prevent duplicate payments in the future. The auditor in her response to the proposed corrective action noted that errors from the report “would not have been detected” by the process described in the controller’s corrective action. 
The report found that the State Department of Education didn’t adequately monitor data supporting about a quarter of payments going to districts. Meaning that in a quarter of the total payments made to schools — or of $545 million — that were sent out, there could be errors, but it’s unclear from the provided information. This issue came up the prior fiscal year too, the report said, which was driven by difficulty in hiring a position that audits the payments. 
The Department of Environmental Quality recorded federal pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, funds twice, overstating its revenue in the ARPA fund by $83.7 million. The Division of Financial Management also misstated ARPA funds, understating it by $175 million. 
A coding error resulted in a misstatement of accrued liabilities and cash in the Department of Health and Welfare of $359 million, and another coding error resulted in $132 million overstated in cash in the annual statewide financial report. 
 What does this mean for the state of Idaho? 

All of the errors identified in the report were fixed. However, the auditors don’t verify every single financial statement in the state budget, but often finds errors through testing a sampling of statements or interviewing staff to determine if internal controls were used, Renfro said. 
Horman said because of this, she’s concerned that there are errors going undetected. 
“I’ll definitely be looking for some reassurance that those have been fixed immediately,” Horman said. 
Smith said that the Controller’s Office is working through the corrective action plan and has additionally revamped its training on the system for employees — who overwhelmingly bemoaned the transition at first. 
Whether those corrective actions are adequate may not be determined until Renfro and other legislative auditors follow-up on the office’s plan to see if the report’s findings were sufficiently addressed.

Here’s how it’s working,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/california-prisons-recidivism-study/,Several new California laws gave incarcerated people a second chance at freedom. A new report provides the first in-depth look at how they’re working.,"In summary
Several new California laws gave incarcerated people a second chance at freedom. A new report provides the first in-depth look at how they’re working. 



California over the past dozen years enacted a series of criminal justice laws that were meant to give more people an opportunity to be resentenced and thin out the state’s severely overcrowded prisons. This week a state agency released the most-comprehensive look yet at how those changes are playing out among formerly incarcerated people. 
The report found low recidivism rates among people who were older and had served lengthy sentences. Those patterns contrasted with people serving shorter prison sentences for nonviolent crimes, which showed higher rates of recidivism, the majority of which were for misdemeanors. 
The Committee on Revision of the Penal Code and California Policy Lab on Wednesday published the report, which details demographics and recidivism rates for five of the most significant resentencing policies implemented between 2012 and 2022 under Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Gov. Jerry Brown.

Changing Three Strikes: Proposition 36 in 2012 allowed people serving a life sentence for a “non-serious, non-violent” third strike offense to petition courts for resentencing. Nearly half of the 2,200 people who were released were Black and most were above age 50. The group had an especially low recidivism rate. 
Lower penalties for drugs and petty theft: Proposition 47 in 2014 allowed incarcerated people convicted of certain low-level drug and theft offenses to petition courts for resentencing. This population, which accounted for the largest share of people released among all of the policies, had a higher recidivism rate.
Restricting felony murder charges: New laws in 2018 and 2022 narrowed the circumstances for prosecutors to charge people with felony murder if they were involved in a crime but did not pull the trigger to kill someone. Those released under the changes had a very low recidivism rate.
Good conduct: A 2018 policy allows the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to recommend resentencing due to changes in the law or positive conduct. The department’s secretary has referred over 2,200 people for resentencing. The report found that 786 of those cases were denied. Those released under the policy had a low recidivism rate.
Rethinking sentencing enhancements: A 2022 law allowed courts to reduce sentences for people who were serving time for enhancements that had been repealed through other laws. The report found that Black and Latino people accounted for 75% of people who were resentenced under the law. 

Under all five policies, approximately 12,000 people have been resentenced and 9,500 have been released, according to the report. Black and Latino people represented the majority of those released under the policies. 
The Committee on Revision of the Penal Code, a state agency created by the Legislature in 2020, is led by a group of academics and lawmakers, most of whom are appointed by Newsom to recommend statutory reforms. The agency partnered with the California Policy Lab, a research institute at UC Berkeley, to produce the report. 
Tom Nosewicz, legal director for the agency, said the data show that the policies have been largely successful at reducing the prison population without increasing risks in public safety and can serve as a blueprint for future changes. 
About 90,000 people are incarcerated in California prisons, down from a peak of about 170,000. It costs roughly $130,000 per year to incarcerate someone. As of December 2024, more than 30,000 incarcerated people were over the age of 50 and had served more than 15 years, according to the report.  
The new laws “helped reduce our prison population, but of course, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Nosewicz. “That’s why I think it’s important to show how we can expand some of these opportunities and show ways that have worked and ways that haven’t.” 
While the report includes one-year recidivism outcomes for all five reform policies, only two of the policies were old enough to measure three-year recidivism outcomes, which is the standard timeline to determine recidivism. Researchers Alissa Skog and Johanna Lacoe acknowledged that as a limitation, noting that a longer time frame can yield “substantially higher recidivism rates.” They also noted that they could not account for people who were eligible under the policies but did not petition the courts or were denied resentencing by judges.
Michele Hanisee, special assistant of legislative affairs for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, said the report was not “an intense study.” 
“It was a superficial data review,” she said. 
Other district attorneys have been critical of the Committee on the Revision of the Penal Code. 
“Generally, the committee’s recommendations, though maybe well-intentioned, have proven to be damaging to victims, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system and have also endangered public safety,” said Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association.
Women benefited from felony murder changes
But Kate Chatfield, executive director of California Public Defenders Association, said that resentencing, writ large, is working. 
“Looking at this holistically, 15 years is the max that we should have someone in prison for. That should be the ceiling,” she said. “If you are looking at public safety, there is no reason to hold people in prison after they age out. That is what this data shows.”
Chatfield, who drafted the 2018 felony murder reform law, was struck by the number of women who were resentenced under it. According to the report, women accounted for 11% of people who were resentenced and released, which was a notch above the 7% they represented in total prison releases. 
Under felony murder reforms, the report showed that nearly 1,200 people have been resentenced, the majority of whom were just over 21-years-old at the time of their offense and nearly half of whom were Black. Many served long prison terms — generally 14 to 15 years — after never having been incarcerated before. 
For those released under felony murder reforms, researchers found that recidivism rates were “notably low” at 3% within a year and 7% within two years, most of which were misdemeanor convictions. Just five people out of 274 had been convicted of a new serious or violent felony within three years. 
“It reinforces how correct it was for the Legislature and Gov. Brown to enact and sign that reform,” said former Oakland Democratic Sen. Nancy Skinner, who authored the 2018 law. “A long sentence does not contribute to improved public safety. There’s just a certain point where we’re warehousing people and using taxpayer dollars in a way that’s proven to be unproductive.”  
‘Who actually needs to be incarcerated’?
Just over 4,700 incarcerated people were resentenced under Prop. 47, nearly half of whom were serving time for a felony drug offense and under the age of 40 at the time of their release, according to the report. Researchers found that 57% of people resentenced under the proposition were convicted of a new crime within three years of release, most of which were misdemeanors. In comparison, 42% of people released between 2018 and 2019 were convicted of a new crime within three years.
Voters last year undid part of Prop. 47 when they passed a new initiative that lengthened sentences for certain theft and drug offenses.
Matt Cate, who was California’s corrections secretary under former Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brown, wasn’t surprised by those high recidivism rates, and said the combination of substance use disorders and property crimes are typically a “recipe for additional crimes committed upon release.” 
But that doesn’t mean those individuals should have been incarcerated for longer, he said. 
“In California and throughout much of the United States, we built the wrong prisons,” said Cate. “We built places that are really good at keeping inmates from escaping and are good, typically, at keeping people — especially staff — safe. But they’re a terrible environment for people to change their lives.”
Jennifer Shaffer, former executive officer of the Board of Parole Hearings, said reports like this will hopefully motivate people to dig deeper and understand how California can do better.
“Who actually needs to be incarcerated is the question,” she said. “This idea that people who commit low-level crime shouldn’t go to state prison, I think makes sense. It makes sense that they get treatment at the local level as opposed to going to state prison, because state prison unfortunately is a very violent place.”

The agency said it included a sharp rise in reservations at sites near federal campgrounds that had been impacted by staffing cuts made by the Trump administration.
According to DCNR, overall summer reservations were up 10% statewide and 60% near affected federal sites from the previous summer. They received a 30% boost in campground reservations after federal closures shifted demand.
“When the federal government closed campgrounds, Pennsylvania stepped up,” said DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn. “Thanks to the incredible work of our state park and forest teams, we kept the outdoors open, awesome, and accessible for all.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In April, DCNR said they were bracing for a “record-breaking” season for state parks and forests, due in part to federal cuts at national parks by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The department also encouraged Pennsylvanians to plan trips for the fall through Pennsylvania: The Great American Getaway, which is a campaign run by the state to promote its public lands, foliage, and outdoor economy.
All of the 124 state parks and forests in Pennsylvania are free and open to the public.
The state Department of Community & Economic Development (DCED) also announced last week that the tourism industry in the state generated $83.9 billion in economic impact, supporting 514,261 jobs in 2024.

The Delaware Office of Auditor of Accounts (AOA) has released a performance audit of the Memorial Volunteer Fire Company (MVFC), citing multiple deficiencies in financial management between 2021 and 2023. 
The audit was requested by the State Fire Commission after members raised concerns over the company’s fiscal practices.
The review covered operations during which MVFC received more than $2.6 million in State funds. According to the report, auditors found widespread issues, including non-compliance with policies, poor documentation of expenses, and weak oversight of financial operations. Testing revealed that 70% of expenses lacked proper board approval and 42% were missing adequate documentation, representing nearly all of the $3.3 million in transactions examined. Payroll was also flagged for errors, with missing timesheets, overpayments, and unreconciled records.
“This performance audit underscores the importance of strong internal controls and rigorous oversight when dealing with State funds, including grant funds,” said State Auditor Lydia E. York. “Delaware’s volunteer firefighters rely on their companies effectively managing State funds to ensure they have the tools they need to save lives. I want to thank the State Fire Commission for their partnership, and Memorial Volunteer Fire Company for their cooperation and commitment to strengthening their fiscal practices.”
The report also noted MVFC’s failure to comply with Sussex County’s grant agreement, as the company did not implement written financial policies until mid-2023. 
Despite the findings, the current MVFC Board has taken steps to correct past weaknesses. Since 2024, the company has hired outside accountants, switched to cloud-based accounting software, and strengthened payroll and credit card oversight. The audit acknowledged these improvements but stated that a future review will be needed to confirm whether the new controls are working effectively.
“I want to thank the State Auditor and her staff for their diligence in assisting the Commission in reviewing the financial status of our volunteer fire companies,” said Fire Commission Chair Ron Marvel. “These companies receive significant amounts of taxpayer funding, often with limited oversight. It’s essential that we work collaboratively with fire service members and legislators to strengthen accountability for how these public funds are spent. At the same time, we must ensure that fire companies have the flexibility to use the resources appropriately so they can continue providing the highest level of protection to their communities.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apparatus_11_14_thumb_w750.jpg,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska is one of five states the Trump administration selected to participate in a pilot program aimed at improving the way the nation carries out the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which is nearing its 30th year.
States tapped for the six-year pilot program — others are Iowa, Arizona, Ohio and Virginia — underwent a competitive process and were announced Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.

“It’s great for Nebraska,” said Shannon Grotrian, director of Nebraska’s Office of Economic Assistance. “We’ll be able to lead the way in showing what works.”
No additional grant money comes with participation in the pilot, though Nebraska will get federal coaching and other support services.
 Pillen touts ‘Nebraska way’ 

Grotrian envisions no change in the amount of benefits provided to the 2,700 Nebraska families participating in the TANF program, a federal block grant that provides cash and other support to eligible low-income families with children. The premise of the pilot is to explore different and better ways to gauge the outcome of TANF spending than the “work participation rate,” which is the current measure of accountability for the program. 
The WPR is the share of work-eligible recipients engaged in countable work activities. States typically must meet a minimum WPR or face financial penalties.
Grotrian said keeping track of hours can be onerous for participants, and she said “now we can measure what truly matters: helping people to become self-sufficient.”
She said currently when an applicant seeks TANF, the state creates an employment plan focused on work participation hours that can include volunteerism and training.
As a pilot program, Grotrian said the state now will start with the end goal in mind, a job and will develop milestones to help get there. She said Nebraska will have the flexibility to redesign its program to “best meet new benchmarks related to increased employment and earnings, reduced dependency and improved family stability.”
When applying for the TANF pilot, officials said the state stood out for its alignment with Trump administration goals and its approach to reducing dependency and increasing workforce participation.
Acting Assistant Secretary of ACF Andrew Gradison, in a statement, highlighted Nebraska’s “employment first” emphasis and its integration of TANF with other federal programs such as Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood.
“The Trump administration recognizes the best economic program is a job, and Nebraska’s pilot reflects our shared commitment to promote personal responsibility and move families out of poverty,” he said.
State officials said Nebraska’s application emphasized employment as the most effective path out of poverty and government dependence. Central program elements include providing participants with individual coaching to identify goals, collaborating with business to connect participants with jobs, expansion of vocational training and internships.

Participants are to continue to receive help with childcare, transportation and to overcome other barriers.
The state said the pilot allows for flexibility for participants with physical or mental health challenges to receive “tailored support” toward earning additional income.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen thanked the Trump administration and said in a statement that he has “insisted” that assistance programs ranging from Medicaid to food benefits be run the “Nebraska Way” of encouraging independence from government.
 Earlier Biden slate nixed

Grotrian anticipates no resistance. “I truly believe we will be able to help people in a much better way than we’ve been able to before,” she said, in guiding a path toward self-sufficiency.
As authorized under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, the pilot program is billed as an opportunity to strengthen state accountability “to the original core TANF values of work and self-sufficiency,” according to the document that invited states to apply.
“The pilot can play a pivotal role in the design of modern approaches to moving work-eligible individuals into the labor force, while providing critical insights” on ways to highlight “personal responsibility,” the guidelines said.
The pilot states announced on Thursday replace a slate previously chosen by the Biden administration. Of the original five, Ohio was re-selected. Others in the first group that were nixed were California, Maine, Kentucky and Minnesota.
In explaining the decision to re-start the pilot, the Trump administration said it sought proposals aligned with the administration’s key priorities and measures of success: promoting work and reducing dependency. 
The first year of the pilot is finalize design and target.  Grotrian said a website soon will launch to share more details.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-25 16:07:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,The grades are in: Mississippi schools backslide on academic progress,Devna Bose and Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/25/mississippi-schools-backslide-on-academic-progress/,"New accountability scores show a decline in academic performance, interrupting steady progress of an education system that is sometimes called the “Mississippi Miracle.”","For the first time in years, the performance of Mississippi schools and districts fell from the previous academic year, according to state education rankings released Thursday.
The new scores interrupt the steady progress of Mississippi’s education system that’s been praised across the country and occasionally referred to as the “Mississippi Miracle.” Coupled with mixed results on state tests this past year, it could signal trouble — a possibility the state superintendent frankly acknowledged in a press release this week. 
“While Mississippi has made historic progress over the past decade, the areas of declining achievement demand our immediate attention,” Lance Evans said. 
This year, 80% of schools and 87% of districts received a “C” or higher on their report card. That’s a meaningful drop compared to the 2023-2024 school year, when 85.7% of schools and 93.9% of districts got a “C” or higher. 
The accountability framework was created by the state Board of Education to judge how well schools are serving their communities. It takes into account state test scores, graduation rates and academic growth. This year’s grades fall short of the board’s goal, set in 2016, that every school and district in Mississippi be rated “C” or higher.
Evans had no explanation for the shortfalls in a press call with Mississippi Department of Education officials Monday. He said as soon as agency leaders got the results, they started investigating reasons for the decline but couldn’t pinpoint one specific thing. 
“We would have loved to have been able to find one particular issue, but we did not find one,” Evans said. “We also know that over a period of … continual gains, there is going to come a point in time in which there is some drift.”

School districts closer to the Gulf Coast dominated the top of the list, including Long Beach, Ocean Springs, Petal, Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis-Waveland. 
The state’s largest school districts mostly received top scores, too. DeSoto County School District, which serves around 35,000 students, got an “A,” as did Rankin County, Harrison County and Madison County. Jackson Public Schools, the second-largest district in the state, got a “C.” 
“I will tell you the reaction that we’ve taken here at the department is we have internally done an analysis of everything we do, every support we provide, to make sure that what we’re doing is actually moving the needle now,” Evans said. 
The state Board of Education approved the accountability grades during a meeting Thursday.

Will grades impact school choice expansion efforts?
With the legislative session on the horizon, the slipping scores could provide fodder for school choice advocates, who have been met with opposing arguments about the success of the state’s public schools. 
Nancy Loome, education advocate and director of The Parents’ Campaign, said it’s important to note that the accountability grades place a strong emphasis on growth. Because Mississippi has consistently seen improvements, she said, it’s harder to maintain that growth from year to year. Last year’s accountability grades were an all-time high for the state. 
She pointed out the National Assessment of Education Progress scores from 2024 showed Mississippi fourth-graders ranked ninth in the country for reading and 16th for math scores.
“I don’t think we have a crisis,” Loome said. “Even as individuals we have good days and bad days, and we’re going to have little bumps in the road. But we didn’t go off a cliff, and I still believe that performance in Mississippi public schools is wonderful.”
The accountability grades could also pave the way for expansion of charter schools, which are publicly-funded schools that operate with more autonomy and independently from districts. Under current state law, charter schools can only be established where local public schools are failing. This year, nine districts earned a “D” or “F” grade, up from three the prior year. 
At the same time, six out of seven of the state’s charter schools that were graded this past year got a “D” or “F” rating.
Angela Bass, executive director of policy research organization Mississippi First and a former charter school leader, said it’s “sobering” to see charters at the bottom of the list. 
But she, like Loome, didn’t think the grades were a signal the state is headed in the wrong direction.
“Of course, it’s always a time to reflect when we see the number of ‘A’ to ‘C’ districts declining and seeing an increase in ‘D’ and ‘F’ grades,” Bass said. “We think that these grades are a tool that helps us reflect on where we are and pinpoint where we need to target our efforts.”
Bass said her organization is focusing on how to bolster early education and literacy efforts, and strengthen the high-quality teacher pipeline in Mississippi. The latter is one of the reasons agency officials gave on the press call Monday for lowered accountability grades among struggling districts in the Delta. 
Some Delta districts struggle, while others shine
Letter grades fell for Holmes County, Humphreys County, Yazoo City and Noxubee County after previously making improvements. All have been taken over by the state for failing performance.
Evans acknowledged his disappointment about the four struggling districts under state control, and said making systemic changes in those districts is “complex work that does not happen overnight.” 
Three out of these four “Districts of Transformation” are in the Delta, a region with understaffed schools, districts with some of the lowest pay for teachers and schools that routinely receive low grades from the accountability system.
“Students are being taught by substitute teachers who are not knowledgeable about the content in some cases,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former principal in Greenville and current executive director of West Mississippi Education Consortium.
Nearly all school districts that received a “D” or an “F” are in the Delta region, with Yazoo City and Clarksdale both receiving an “F.” Greenville, Humphreys County, West Bolivar and Greenwood-Leflore all received a “D.”
“If you look at the larger school districts, which are struggling, they have high turnover at the administrative level,” Barksdale said. “How can there be constant growth with a different superintendent and a different mission and a different vision year after year?”

For teachers in struggling districts, boosting the school’s accountability score and encouraging student progress makes up a big portion of work responsibilities. State-tested teachers are often paired with consultants who work with them to move the bottom 25% of students in a subject, which is prioritized in the school accountability system.
Sylvia Jones, a high school science teacher in Humphreys County, said that meant spending her planning period and after school time studying data in which students are ranked by how they scored on their most recent state tests. Students also took biweekly benchmark assessments to track progress throughout the year.
But with so much testing, Jones had to discuss strategies to avoid burnout and build endurance. It can put a lot of pressure on students and staff, she said.
Three Delta school districts received “B” ratings. Tunica County retained its “B” from last year and was the highest performing Delta school district. Leland and Hollandale, two of the smallest districts in the state and located in Washington County, moved from a “C” to a “B.”
“I would credit (the ‘B’) to teacher retention and curbing absenteeism,” said the Rev. Jessie King, superintendent of Leland School District. “We continuously studied the data.”
He said attendance was 90% to 93% most days.
“I would tell other Delta school districts, it is doable and achievable if there is buy-in from staff and administration,” King said. “Public education in Mississippi is an all-time success story. I would say in the midst of upcoming legislative changes, we should rally around the success of our public schools.
“Right now, I don’t think the timing is ripe for an overhaul.”
Next steps
Moving forward, the state education agency plans to seek more dollars from the Legislature this spring to fund a math initiative for grades 2-6 and an adolescent literacy initiative for grades 4-8, expanding the agency’s previous literacy work that transformed reading in Mississippi. 
The state education department is also working on a new strategic plan that will be released in 2026 and updating the accountability system by which schools are measured. The new framework, which will be finalized this fall, will add a focus on college and career readiness and raise the standards for each letter grade. 
“The foundation we have built over the past decade remains strong,” Evans said. “Higher academic standards, targeted support for teachers, and a strong accountability system have improved student achievement in Mississippi over the long term. This year’s results do not change our commitment to these proven strategies.” 
C. Alan Burrow, associate superintendent for district and school performance, said Thursday that schools with low proficiency rates can earn points through growth.
“Accountability is essential to ensuring that we’re working towards our overall goals, making sure that all students are ready to be successful when they leave public education,” Burrow said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17124216/3X0A8409.jpg,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211
,DC,2025-09-25 16:01:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"As immigration raids step up, US citizens predicted at risk for detainment",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-raids-step-us-citizens-predicted-risk-detainment,,"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued in a major case earlier this month that U.S. citizens face few problems in having their immigration status verified if federal agents apprehend them.“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,” Kavanaugh wrote in concurrence with an opinion in a case on the emergency docket. In reality, the Trump administration’s aggressive drive to carry out mass deportations of people without legal status already has led to U.S. citizens being swept up in raids and detained, according to news reports from around the country as well as immigration experts. Such detainments now will increase, experts predict.Once in detention, it can take time to verify citizenship. A passport is considered the gold standard for proof that an individual is a citizen, but fewer than half of Americans hold passports, according to the State Department’s most recent data from 2024. Even fewer are likely to carry the bulky document around.Kavanaugh’s remarks came in a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that gave the go-ahead, for now, for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to use racial profiling in enforcement raids in Los Angeles, while a case on the issue proceeds through the courts. A district court's order had barred federal immigration officers from using racial profiling to detain immigrants without legal status.Two of the five plaintiffs at the center of the case are Latino men who repeatedly informed federal immigration officials they were U.S. citizens, but were still arrested and detained. All three liberal justices on the high court dissented with the ruling that authorized racial profiling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a scathing opinion said Kavanaugh’s reasoning “blinks reality.” John Sandweg, an attorney who served as the acting director at ICE during the Obama administration, said in an interview with States Newsroom that the outcome is clear.“There's a high likelihood, based on this opinion, that somebody who is a United States citizen could be detained for days, if not weeks, while ICE goes out and tries to confirm … that they are in fact a U.S. citizen,” said Sandweg.“It's not something you can figure out in the parking lot of a Home Depot,” he said, referring to locations targeted by ICE because day laborers, typically lacking legal status, wait there to find work.Proving you are a citizenThere is no national database of U.S. citizens and no requirement to carry around a national ID, meaning it can take ICE significant time to verify citizenship status, Sandweg said.There is an exception for naturalized citizens, something ICE officers can quickly check in a database. But more complex situations such as Americans born abroad to U.S. citizen parents, known as derivative citizenship, can be more problematic.Obtaining a passport is an answer but it is expensive, costing up to $160 to renew or get one for the first time, and takes weeks for processing.  Even carrying a form of identification like a driver’s license doesn’t guarantee proof of citizenship, as 19 states and the District of Columbia approve driver’s licenses regardless of citizenship status. It’s unclear how often ICE mistakenly arrests U.S. citizens, but the most recent data comes from a 2021 report from the Government Accountability Office, an independent federal watchdog agency. The report found that ICE arrested 674 “potential” U.S. citizens, detained 121 and deported 70 from fiscal year 2015 to six months into 2020 — long before the current crackdown.ICE did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for comment about the process for immigration officials to verify citizenship.‘Apparent ethnicity’The order from the high court, for now, will allow federal immigration officials to use “apparent ethnicity” as one factor in determining reasonable suspicion that a person is violating U.S. immigration law, as long as it is not the only factor. Before the district court issued a restraining order on the practice, immigration agents used a broad variety of factors to determine someone’s apparent ethnicity, including speaking Spanish or accented English, certain types of work like landscaping and day labor and locations such as bus stops or car washes.The case stemmed from the administration’s mass raids this summer on Los Angeles-area Home Depot stores and other sites where day laborers gather, sparking massive protests in the city. President Donald Trump cited the protests in deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to the city, over California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objections. Those two plaintiffs in the case are not the only U.S. citizens swept up in ICE raids during the second Trump administration.In Florida, police detained a 20-year-old for days following a traffic stop, even though he told officers he was a U.S. citizen and provided his Social Security card. In New Jersey, ICE detained a U.S. citizen who was a military veteran for hours before releasing him. And in Southern California, a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran was detained for three days by federal immigration officials, The Atlantic reported. Members of Congress have also expressed concern about federal immigration officials arresting and detaining U.S. citizens, and 50 Democratic lawmakers have pressed the Department of Homeland Security internal watchdogs to investigate if the agency is violating Americans’ civil rights.“We are increasingly concerned by reporting that U.S. citizens are being detained as a result of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” they wrote in a letter last month to the DHS  Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.Supreme Court ‘signaling to ICE’The ruling, while based on immigration raids in Los Angeles, could have effects nationwide, said Sophia Genovese, a clinical teaching fellow and supervising attorney at Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Legal Studies. The Trump administration launched an immigration crackdown in Chicago and Boston this month, two cities with large immigrant populations. They were also the frequent target for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to send buses of newly arrived migrants from the southern border. Genovese said while Kavanaugh’s concurrence is not a binding majority opinion, “it’s still signaling to ICE that they can engage in this racial profiling,” for a warrantless arrest. ICE agents are allowed to make warrantless arrests if an officer has probable cause or reason to believe a person is in the United States without legal authorization and can escape before a warrant is obtained.   “The situation that we're seeing play out in L.A. and across the country is a warrantless arrest, and the reality on the ground is they're being quite violent and physical with people,” she said. “They're quite literally snatching people off the street.”Genovese, who specializes in immigration and asylum law, said that even when a U.S. citizen produces their documents, it can take weeks to be released for detention or to have a case closed in immigration court. “People are scared, and people have been saying they feel like they need to carry their ‘papers,’ whether that's a passport or a green card or something else, to prove that they have a right to be here,” Genovese said. “That isn't required under the law, but that's nevertheless the impact it's having on communities.”She added that the burden to prove citizenship should be on the federal government, not the individual. It’s a consequence that Sotomayor warned in her dissent would fall on the Latino community, arguing that it creates a second-class citizenship status and violates the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment that bars unreasonable search and seizure.“The Government, and now the concurrence, has all but declared that all Latinos, U. S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,” she wrote.",,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota agency has approved a permit for what could become the largest dairy in state history — a 25,000-cow milking operation in Traill County. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality is issuing the permit for Riverview Dairy at a site near the Red River southeast of Hillsboro. 
Riverview, based in Morris, Minnesota, plans to build two large dairies on the North Dakota side of the Red River that could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades. 
Riverview had already obtained an environmental permit for a 12,500-cow dairy north of Wahpeton in Richland County. 
Comment period opens on proposed 25,000-cow dairy’s environmental permit 

Riverview still needs permits from the North Dakota Department of Water Resources to supply the dairies with the large amounts of water the dairies need. Riverview says its cows need 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow each day. That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site.
The environmental permit reviewed such things as Riverview’s plans for storing manure from the cows and applying it to farm fields near the dairy as fertilizer. 
A news release from the Department of Environmental Quality said Riverview identified sufficient cropland acres to apply the manure. But because of public concerns, the agency will continue to analyze the 100-year floodplain near the Traill County dairy. No fields in the floodplain were approved for manure application.
Riverview said Thursday it hopes to begin moving dirt at the site this fall, with construction taking about two years.  It has already started dirt work in Richland County.

In the news release, the Department of Environmental Quality said the agency is committed to protecting the environment and public health. 
“During the construction phase, staff will conduct regular facility inspections to ensure full compliance with all permit conditions. Once the operation begins, inspections will occur at least annually to verify continued adherence to permit requirements,” the agency said. 
Some environmental groups such as North Dakota-based Dakota Resource Council and others based in Manitoba, Canada, have expressed concerns about the potential for pollution from the dairies into the north-flowing Red River. 
In submitted comments, the Dakota Resource Council said the “failure to regulate Herberg Dairy in a manner that prevents water pollution will harm human health, wildlife, and North Dakota’s outdoor recreational economy.” It also said the dairy will add to the cost of cleaning up Red River water for cities downstream that use the river as a drinking water source, such as Grand Forks and Grafton.
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Canadian groups have expressed concerns about pollution in the Red River contributing to algae bloom on Lake Winnipeg, which the river drains into. 
Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, refers to the Traill County site as Herberg Dairy, named for the township it will be in. 
“Our dairies are designed to meet or exceed strict environmental standards, reflecting our commitment to caring for land, water, animals, and people,”  Riverview said in an emailed statement. “We are also committed to being a good neighbor and community partner.” 
The Traill County dairy would create about 100 jobs and the Richland Dairy 45 to 50 jobs, according to Riverview.
Jim Murphy, executive director of the Traill County Economic Development Commission, called the permit approval great news for Hillsboro and Traill County but said housing workers will be a challenge. 
“We don’t have much for housing in town, so that’s a solution we will need to work on over the next 18 months,” Murphy said in an interview with the Hillsboro Banner.

Riverview provides housing on site for some of its workers who milk cows around the clock. 
When Riverview filed for its permit for the Herberg Dairy, the Department of Environmental Quality held a public hearing in Hillsboro in May, with many of the comments in support. 
That included Darin Johnson, the mayor of Halstad, Minnesota, a town on the Red River that is closer to the dairy site than Hillsboro. He has visited a Riverview Dairy and said he’s impressed with its risk management and manure handling methods.
“I really believe the manure is liquid gold that is going to help our soils and help our crops,” Johnson said at the hearing.

WILMINGTON — Two New Castle County–produced documentaries exploring Delaware’s legacy of racial justice have captured top honors, including a Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award.
On Saturday, September 20, the team earned its second win in four years at the 2025 Mid-Atlantic Emmy Awards.
The documentary “Restless Ground: The Untold Story of Mt. Olive” won in the Diversity/Equity/Inclusion Long-Form category, which “honors excellence in content focused on topics including racism, discrimination, inequity, marginalized communities and similar social injustices, notably focused on efforts to raise awareness or affect positive change,” according to the contest’s 2025 call for entries.
“This story is about truth, justice, and honoring the lives and legacies of people too long overlooked,” Governor Matt Meyer said. “I am deeply proud of the team that brought this story forward and grateful to the Mother Africa Union Church community for trusting us with it. Telling even our hardest, cruelest Delaware history can spark change and build a more just future.”
Restless Ground: Honoring Mt. Olive’s Legacy
Produced by Meyer, Deputy Director of Strategic Communications Kyle Grantham, and others in partnership with 1440 Film Co., “Restless Ground” explores the history of Mt. Olive Cemetery. 
RELATED STORY: Wilmington International Film Festival features Shuffle, exposing addiction treatment fraud
The film examines the impact of institutional racism on those buried there, New Castle County’s work with the Mother African Union Church and Trust for Public Land to restore dignity after decades of neglect, and the personal connection discovered by one man who had long maintained the property.
“I’m incredibly honored that ‘Restless Ground’ was recognized and thankful for the amazing colleagues I was fortunate to partner with in telling this story,” Grantham said. “This project was something I worked on for three years, and it couldn’t have become a reality without our crew at 1440, or the Mt. Olive community opening up and sharing their stories with us.”
Return to Hockessin No. 107C: A Story of Desegregation
Another New Castle County production, “Return to Hockessin No. 107C,” is gaining national recognition. Produced with Bowstring, the documentary has been screened at several film festivals across the country and won Best Documentary Short at the Newark Independent Film Festival in August.
The film was also nominated for a 2025 Mid-Atlantic Emmy in the Historical/Cultural Long-Form category and accepted to the Diamond State Black Film Festival, Independent Shorts Awards, and Micheaux Film Festival.
“Return to Hockessin No. 107C” tells the story of Hockessin Colored School No. 107C and its role in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Former students recall the closure of their school and the backlash they faced in their community. The film also chronicles efforts to preserve the abandoned building, giving those students a chance to return decades later.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Emmyawards-768x532-1.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

Haley Stevens, as the congresswoman on Thursday filed articles of impeachment over what she called dangerous cuts to medical research.
Stevens (D-Brimingham) also cited the increased cost to health care under RFK Jr.’s short time as secretary, abuses of power and ongoing threats to public health. The congresswoman previously asked Kennedy to resign, but is now trying to force his ouster through articles of impeachment.
“RFK Jr. is making our country less safe and making healthcare less affordable and accessible for Michiganders,” Stevens said in a news release. “His contempt for science, the constant spreading of conspiracy theories, and his complete disregard for the thousands of research hours spent by America’s top doctors and experts is unprecedented, reckless, and dangerous. Enough is enough – we need leaders who put science over chaos, facts over lies, and people over politics.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The cuts in question center around cancer research, as well as sudden infant death syndrome and studies on combating addiction.
Kennedy’s restriction of vaccine access was another point of contention, and his spreading of “absurd conspiracies” that have put people’s lives in danger, Stevens said.
The secretary is also being accused of lying in his confirmation hearings over promises he made during those proceedings that have not been upheld. The chief promise Stevens cited was his pledge to not break up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine panel of independent experts.
While the filing has little chance of passing the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, Stevens said she believes Kennedy has failed to carry out his statutory duties in administering the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Stevens is among several Democrats seeking the nomination to run for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat next year. Also running are state Sen.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-25 15:24:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford immigration judge Ted Doolittle removed in Trump administration firings,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/25/ted-doolittle-immigration-judge-trump-administration-firings/,Ted Doolittle joins dozens of other immigration judges who have been fired or not renewed in their positions this year.,"Hartford immigration judge Ted Doolittle has been terminated from his position, joining a wave of federal court officials removed by the Trump administration in recent weeks.
Doolittle said he was notified Sept. 11 that his appointment would not be renewed and immediately placed on leave. His employment then ended Tuesday, the final day of his two-year probationary term as an immigration judge.
Notice came via a brief letter signed by the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for adjudicating immigration cases.
The letter didn’t provide a reason why Doolittle was let go, stating only that “the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment.”
Doolittle joins dozens of other immigration judges who have been fired or not renewed in their positions this year, including at least 14 who received notice this month, according to NPR. They worked in courts in Florida, New York, Maryland, California and Washington state, NPR reported.
Doolittle was first appointed in 2023 by then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. Doolittle said he doesn’t know whether his dismissal was politically motivated, but he has no doubt the broader wave of terminations is “part of a political agenda and a political strategy.”
“They’re cutting bodies from what’s supposed to be an independent adjudicatory agency at a time when the caseload is crushing,” he said. “And it’s getting even more urgent as they put more and more people into jail.”
The firings come as the nation’s immigration courts struggle to process an enormous and growing backlog of cases, which has been exacerbated by a lack of available judges.
At the time of his removal, Doolittle said he was one of only two full-time judges working in the Hartford immigration court, which has seen its pending caseload swell to more than 40,000. A third judge based in Connecticut also splits duties between cases in Hartford and other jurisdictions, Doolittle said.
It’s unclear how Doolittle’s position will be filled. An EOIR spokesperson said the agency declines to comment because it is a personnel matter.


The Associated Press reported previously the Trump administration plans to send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges amid the shortage, a move that has alarmed some Democratic lawmakers.
Doolittle’s abrupt departure this month had puzzled some local immigration lawyers, who told Connecticut Public scheduled hearings for their clients were moved or canceled with no explanation. Doolittle said he was scheduled to hear 57 cases on the Friday after he was placed on leave alone.
“I do worry that overall, the system is being administered or managed in a way that is not pointed toward trying to do justice as quickly as possible in the largest number of cases as possible,” Doolittle said.
Doolittle’s legal career includes work in the private and public sectors, including serving most recently as the healthcare advocate for the state of Connecticut from 2017 through 2023. He is also former deputy director of the Center for Program Integrity at the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As recently as July 24, Doolittle received a positive review of his performance as an immigration judge, which recommended he remain in the position. A supervisor wrote that Doolittle “demonstrated exceptional dedication and professionalism” in handling complex cases, while also efficiently handling the workload.
Court records show Doolittle completed more than 1,900 cases in the current federal budget year, well ahead of the goal of 700 cases he said was set for his position.
“Judge Doolittle maintains high standards of judicial conduct, and this reflects his dedication to the administration of justice in one of the nation’s most overburdened immigration courts,” the evaluation reads.
Doolittle said he stands by his record on the bench, and said he granted asylum or other relief when it was indicated and denied it in many other cases.
“I did love the job, and I gave it everything I could, and I want to think that I did the best that I could for the families in front of me,” he said.

Under updated regulations adopted in May by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, each district must develop and submit a local Competency Determination (CD) policy and graduation requirements to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) by December 31.
The shift comes in the wake of the 2024 ballot law ending the decades-long MCAS graduation requirement. In response, DESE Commissioner Pedro Martinez issued guidance in July detailing how districts must outline the coursework and assessment methods they will use to determine student competency in English language arts, math, and science through grade 10. Beginning with the class of 2027, U.S. history will also be required.
Districts must define which courses will fulfill these requirements, how students will demonstrate mastery, and how policies will accommodate students with disabilities, English learners and late enrollees. They are also required to create an appeals process and allow for transcript reviews for current or former students.
All policies must be approved locally before being submitted to DESE through the state’s online system.
Students must also meet local graduation requirements — such as credits, attendance or community service — which are separate and cannot replace the state-mandated CD policy.
The regulatory changes are temporary. In January, Gov. Maura Healey formed the Massachusetts K–12 Statewide Graduation Council to recommend a permanent statewide graduation standard. That 31-member group is expected to issue its final recommendations by July 2026.
On Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll and Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler will hold a press conference at Attleboro High School to unveil the council’s “Vision of a Graduate” and mark the council’s “first step towards recommending a statewide set of high school graduation standards,” according to a media advisory.
The advisory says the vision statement is intended to articulate what Massachusetts students should know and be able to do by the time they graduate, forming a foundation for a statewide framework.
The council has held eight listening sessions. Any permanent changes to graduation requirements will likely require further regulatory or legislative action.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Education-Testing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

(Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)A pair of anti-abortion organizations on Wednesday announced their plans to pour $4.5 million into field outreach aimed at securing Michigan’s vacant U.S. Senate seat for Republicans in 2026. 
Susan B, Anthony Pro-Life America and its partner Women Speak Out PAC said its campaign will target anti-abortion voters who do not consistently vote in the midterm election and persuadable voters in the Lansing, Detroit and Grand Rapids area. The effort will include digital advertising, voter mail and an early voting campaign. 
“We’re energized and ready for the next critical chapter in the fight for life,” said Emily Green, a field director for SBA Pro-Life. “The murder of Charlie Kirk – a true champion for the unborn – has only strengthened our resolve. Now more than ever, we’re committed to speaking out with courage. By connecting with voters and winning key elections, we can save more unborn children and support moms.”
The group also led a door-knocking campaign in the 2024 election, which the group says reached 750,000 voters. 
“Four Planned Parenthoods in Michigan have closed their doors because we took back the White House and Congress in 2024 – and we’re just getting started. America’s premier pro-life field program will complete 1 million voter visits over the next 13 months to build on that momentum and defend and grow our pro-life majority in the U.S. Senate,” the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement.

While a Democratic nominee will not be selected until the August primary election, Dannenfelser said that whoever emerges victorious “is going to be an abortion extremist.”
The Democratic slate of candidates includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed and research health specialist Rachel Howard. 
Reproductive Freedom For All Michigan slammed the announcement, saying the group was aiming to buy the open Senate seat for an anti-abortion extremist. 
“In 2022, Michiganders proudly passed Prop 3 to constitutionally protect access to abortion, making it clear they will not stand for a Senator who will gut their access to reproductive care. We are grateful to Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) for holding the line in Michigan,”  Reproductive Freedom for All President and CEO Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. 
The Michigan Democratic Party took aim at the presumptive Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, former U.S. Rep, Mike Rogers (R-White Lake). 
During his 2024 campaign against Slotkin, Rogers said he would honor the state’s decision to protect reproductive rights at the state level. However, Democrats argued Rogers cannot be trusted on reproductive healthcare, citing his record of opposing abortion while serving in the U.S. House.
“Michigan women and families deserve better than Mike Rogers, who will be beholden to out-of-state special interests trying to strip away their constitutional right to reproductive freedom,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/March01-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-25 15:03:29+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Phoning it in – Mass. residents still lean toward in-person care as telehealth booms,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/phoning-it-in-mass-residents-still-lean-toward-in-person-care-as-telehealth-booms/,"While the rise of telehealth in the early 2020s “did improve access to care,” according to the Health Policy Commission, not everyone is able to use the new virtual hospital landscape. “Specific actions could be taken to further enhance access for more rural and vulnerable populations.""","AS THE COVID-19 pandemic surged, homes became workplaces, schools, and day care centers. And with the rise of telehealth, they became remote doctors’ offices too.  
Now half a decade from the first lockdowns, most major providers offer telehealth options, but new polling finds nearly two-thirds of Bay State residents are still primarily receiving their health care the old-fashioned way: in person. 
Telehealth involves a clinician providing a patient medical services, in real time or asynchronously, generally by phone or video conferencing. While technological developments like laptops and cell phones made the practice more convenient in recent decades, KFF research in March 2020 found use of telemedicine in the US was minimal. Growth was slow, hampered by irregular insurance coverage policies and hurdles like high startup costs, workflow reconfiguration, clinician buy-in, and patient interest.  
That all changed in 2020. With the onset of the pandemic, usage soared. Massachusetts lawmakers passed a suite of pandemic-focused reforms to enable broad use of telehealth. The new regulations made coverage for telehealth services and cost parity between telehealth and in-person behavioral health services permanent. For primary care and chronic disease management, in person and telehealth cost parity changes were temporary. 
Two-thirds of covered outpatient visits in Massachusetts in April 2020 were telehealth visits, settling at about 31 percent of those visits over the course of the year. “As the most acute phase of the pandemic has ended,” the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission wrote in 2023, “telehealth has remained an important element of the health care delivery system.”  
While the rise of telehealth in the early 2020s “did improve access to care,” an HPC spokesperson said this month, not everyone is able to use the new virtual hospital landscape. “Specific actions could be taken to further enhance access for more rural and vulnerable populations,” the spokesperson said.  
According to new polling data from the MassINC Polling Group for CommonWealth Beacon, many Massachusetts residents aren’t leaning heavily into the digital health care transformation. The survey found that 37 percent had no telehealth appointments in the past year, while another 25 percent said less than half of their appointments were conducted virtually. (MassINC Polling Group is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher, MassINC.)

Those who make under $75,000 a year were significantly more likely to report no medical appointments in the last year (10 percent) than those making over $75,000 (3 percent). For those who did report medical appointments, higher income brackets were more likely to report fewer telehealth visits, though a majority of respondents of all income levels said they had no telehealth appointments or less than half of their appointments were telehealth over the past year. 
For those who want and can access telehealth, options abound. 
The Bay State has the third highest rate of hospital telehealth adoption in the country – 93.8 percent of its hospitals had installed some sort of telemedicine solution by early 2024.  
Mass General Brigham, the state’s largest health system and private employer, launched a new virtual and artificial intelligence-based primary care platform this month. For now, the program covers MGB patients who are between providers and those in risk-based contracts who haven’t come in for a visit in the past year.  
A spokesperson said the health system plans to expand the program this winter to reach new patients who prefer a virtual primary care physician experience. 
“Mass General Brigham always strives to provide the best quality, personalized care for our patients and give options as to how patients access care,” the hospital said in a statement. “Telehealth is a vital tool to expand access to care and lower barriers for patients.” 
Digital tools can ease some of the workforce strain, hospitals and insurers say. Facing weeks, months, or even more than a year of wait time for appointments, patients may opt for telehealth as an initial option if they can access it. 
“We understand how difficult it is for our members to access high-quality, affordable care,” Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts spokesperson Kelsey Pearse said in a statement. “We’re focused on building a network of providers and solutions that can support our members now and navigate them to the care they need when they need it.” 
Blue Cross Blue Shield pointed to 13 percent growth in their primary care network and 48 percent growth in their mental health provider network over the past five years, including in-person and “virtual first” providers. Almost all of the system’s providers offer some sort of telemedicine these days, Pearse noted. The major remote-only vendor through BCBS is the telehealth network Well Connection. Other digital health options that have boomed during the pandemic include the physical therapy app Hinge Health and the virtual women’s health clinic Maven Clinic. 
According to Epic Research tracking, telehealth had declined from its mid-pandemic peak but remained above pre-pandemic levels, especially in behavioral health fields. About 27 percent of mental health contacts were via telehealth in June 2025, compared to less than 7 percent of primary care and 2 percent for urgent care. 
Pandemic aside, remote health care has stayed in the headlines because of its role in accessing abortion medications, something that is increasingly under attack in dozens of states.  
Since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the number of people receiving abortion medication prescriptions through telehealth has surged, with a Society of Family Planning report finding that a quarter of all abortions in the United States were delivered via telehealth prescriptions of medication by the end of 2024.  
Massachusetts providers reaffirmed earlier this month that they plan to continue mailing abortion pills to Texas even after its governor, Greg Abbott, signed a first-of-its-kind law that lets anyone sue prescribers and others responsible for getting abortion pills into the state.  
But accessing virtual care requires access to technology and a strong internet connection.  
The Health Policy Commission identified low digital literacy and a lack of access to connected devices and reliable internet as the biggest barriers for patients to access telehealth services. They also found telehealth platforms, patient portals, and other patient communication materials may be challenging to use for those with lower English proficiency or vision and hearing impairments. 
For regions without many accessible care facilities, telehealth is pitched as a partial solution. It may be physically easier to access than distant in-person appointments, but the regions also need improvements to their digital infrastructure to make full use of virtual care. 
“Rural patients face unique challenges in accessing both in-person and audio-video services, creating inequities in care,” according to the National Rural Health Association. “Rural patients, on average, travel further to access health care than their non-rural counterparts. This disincentivizes rural residents from seeking care if they do not have the ability or resources for travel.”    
These areas have less broadband infrastructure and lower rates of smartphone ownership, the advocacy organization notes. Expanded telehealth and rural internet offerings during the pandemic have been a boon, it says, and rural areas “will suffer if such flexibilities are removed.” 
Residents in Southeast Massachusetts were least likely in polling to regularly use telehealth, with just 22 percent reporting that more than half of their appointments were remote and 37 percent reporting no telehealth appointments in the past year. Greater Boston residents were most likely to report more than half of appointments by telehealth (31 percent), with Western and Central Massachusetts regions reporting less regular telehealth usage but also fewer overall medical appointments in the last year. 
Massachusetts lawmakers are still refining the state’s telehealth policies.  
The initial telehealth legislation’s payment parity mandate between telehealth and in-person services expired at the end of 2022, which the Massachusetts Medical Society noted “caused some insurers to reduce reimbursement rates. This variation in payment policies creates confusion and instability for providers and limits patient access to care.” 
Rep. Marjorie Decker and Sen. Adam Gomez have introduced legislation this session to re-establish payment parity for all telehealth services and create initiatives to advance digital health equity.  
A hearing on legislation put forward by Rep. William MacGregor of Boston that would create a special commission to study the accessibility and quality of telehealth is scheduled for September 29.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Telemedicine_Consult.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

WILMINGTON– Buccini Pollin Group, Inc. (BPG) has officially opened The Press, a 243-unit luxury apartment community at 801 N Orange Street, marking a milestone year for the developer’s residential growth across the region.
The ribbon-cutting on Wednesday featured remarks from Wilmington Mayor John Carney and BPG Founder Rob Buccini, highlighting the project as part of BPG’s record-breaking year in multifamily housing delivery.
“The Press exemplifies our commitment to creating exceptional residential experiences in the heart of Wilmington,” said Rob Buccini, founder, Buccini Pollin Group. “This project represents more than just adding housing inventory—it’s about creating vibrant communities where residents can live, work, and thrive in downtown’s most connected locations.”
The Press represents a $90 million investment in Wilmington’s revitalization. Designed by Perkins Eastman, the 14-story glass and metal tower features an indoor lounge and dining space, a fourth-floor roof deck with views of downtown, and a private exterior area with a pool, dog run, grill stations, and social gathering spots. The development also features a landscaped pocket park open to the public, providing a green space for both residents and the surrounding community.

Apartments range from studios to three-bedroom units and duplexes, with high-end finishes such as quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washers and dryers, and expansive windows. 
The name, The Press, pays tribute to the site’s history as the former headquarters of The News Journal.
The Press is the latest in a wave of BPG projects in 2025 that together bring more than 1,000 new apartments to the region. Highlights include the completion of The Standard at Market West, new groundbreakings at the University of Delaware’s STAR Campus and Justison Landing Residences on the Riverfront, and the ribbon cutting of Humble Park Place on Lower Market Street.

“Our momentum this year reflects not just market opportunity, but our deep understanding of what today’s residents need,” added Buccini. “From adaptive reuse projects like The Standard to ground-up developments like The Press and our STAR Campus community, we’re creating diverse housing options that serve Delaware’s growing workforce and attract new residents to our region.”

Laura Kelly and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told Democrats a key goal in 2026 election cycle was breaking the GOP supermajority in the House.,"House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, joins Gov. Laura Kelly at a Sept. 23, 2025, rally that affirmed Democrats would try again in 2026 to break the Republican supermajority in the Kansas House. Democrats made it a top priority in 2024, but lost seats to Republicans in the House. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard says there’s no way to sugarcoat results of the November 2024 election that deepened the Republican supermajority in the Kansas House.
The idea, from the perspective of Democrats, was to recruit viable candidates to compete in winnable districts so the 85-40 GOP advantage would be reduced by at least two. That would have made it more difficult for House GOP leadership to secure 84 votes to override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly or to place constitutional amendments on statewide ballots.
The opposite occurred in the 2024 general election as Republicans expanded their grip on the House by winning an 88-37 majority. Likewise, Republicans expanded the partisan edge in the Senate to 31-9 by picking up two seats.
“Let’s be honest. Last November was tough. We lost seats. We lost ground,” said Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat.
He told more than 200 people at a Democratic Party event Tuesday night in Johnson County that House Democrats were outmuscled daily at the Capitol during the 2025 legislative session. The experience inspired a 14-city tour that included Dodge City, Pittsburg, Newton, Emporia, Hays, Topeka, Wichita and Manhattan.
The objective, Woodard said, was to open conversations with all sorts of voters about what was occurring in Topeka as well as Washington, D.C. He said the tour was also about finding allies to help flip at least five GOP House seats and retain all 37 Democrat seats in November 2026, which would be enough to break Republican Party’s two-thirds supermajority in the House.
“I’m hopeful about what’s ahead with us in 2026,” Woodard said. “Not only to win back seats and break the supermajority, but to end the extreme right madness being funneled into Kansas.”
On election night in November 2024, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach declared that wider GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate should be used to unlock the two-thirds majorities necessary to place an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the ballot to enable direct election of justices to the Kansas Supreme Court. That’s exactly what happened during the 2025 session of the Legislature. The question will be decided by voters on the August 2026 primary ballot.
Senate President Ty Masterson, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins relied on their GOP supermajorities to push back against dozens of vetoes by Kelly in the 2025 session. They appear ready to do the same in the 2026 session — Kelly’s last as governor.
Kelly, who spoke to the Johnson County audience with Woodard, deployed a $2 million political action committee in an effort to turn the tide in favor of Democrats in legislative races in 2024.
She said that with the 40-member Senate not up for reelection until 2028, legislative investments next year could target the 125 House seats.
“There are some opportunities for us to pick up some more Democrats,” she said.
She said voters should respond to work of Democrats to fund K-12 public schools, eliminate the state sales tax on groceries and bring $22 billion in new private sector investments to Kansas since 2019.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Woodard-lenexa-2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

Bill Jennings, a 69-year-old libertarian who lives in Daytona Beach, Florida, said his mother and wife both worked outside the home, but he has been impressed by the younger generation of women in his family who are homeschooling their children.
“Both parents should participate in raising children, but I’m thinking more that the man is typically the breadwinner and the female is more focused on the home and raising children,” Jennings said. “I know it sounds old-fashioned.”
Half of respondents to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll said they believe, like Jennings, that society would benefit from a return to traditional gender roles. Men were more likely than women to want a return to traditional gender roles, however — nearly 6 in 10 of them agreed with that, compared with 4 in 10 women.
“I’m not taking a hard line that ‘the woman’s place is in the home,’ but I just think the traditional roles are generally better — our traditional cultural, Western cultural roles are better for the family and for children,” Jennings said.
The new data on Americans’ views on gender roles comes amid the high-profile assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who often argued to his audience of younger Americans that men should be providers and leaders in their homes, while young women should cherish marriage and children over careers. Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow has vowed to carry forward her husband’s work as the CEO of the company he helped found.
While Gen Z men were less likely than men of older generations to agree at 54 percent, the gap between Gen Z men and women was 19 points, illustrating the ways in which younger Americans are diverging when it comes to culture and politics.
Women of both parties were less likely to support a return to traditional gender roles than men. Support for a return to traditional gender roles was highest among Republican men at 87 percent, followed by Republican women at 79 percent. Democratic women were the least likely to support a return to traditional gender roles — 23 percent do, compared with 29 percent of Democratic men.
Another notable gender divide exists between men and women who are married and who are parenting. Married men support the premise at 62 percent, compared with fewer than half of married women at 47 percent. Sixty-seven percent of dads support a return to traditional gender roles, compared with 52 percent of moms.
Divorced men were most likely to think that society would benefit from a return to traditional gender roles at 67 percent. Women who have never been married were the least likely to agree at 37 percent.
SurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.
Eve Rodsky, a lawyer specializing in organizational management who has become a prominent advocate for fair labor division in the home, said many Americans have long yearned for an idyllic “Leave it to Beaver” lifestyle. The current rise in Christian nationalism being promoted by Republicans in power — and on full display following the death of Kirk — will only turbocharge those long-standing yearnings, Rodsky said.
“This idea of women being at home is so strong that I would have been shocked if I saw something different in the data,” said Rodsky, the author of “Fair Play,” a book and card game designed to guide couples through domestic divisions of labor. “It is in our lore.”
The survey showed stark religious divides: More than three-quarters of evangelical Christians — 77 percent — agree with a return to traditional gender roles, compared with 54 percent of non-evangelical Christians, 32 percent of Jewish people, and 15 percent of atheist or agnostic people.
The survey also asked Americans whether or not they agree with the statement, “Families are better off when one parent stays home with the children.” A net 63 percent of Americans agreed, including 69 percent of men and 58 percent of women.

Holly Ann Zuercher, a 71-year-old Republican in Florida, also responded to the survey and said at least one parent should stay home for the sake of the children. She said she and her sister were raised in a home with a dad who worked full-time and a mom who stayed home full-time for about a decade before returning to work part-time.
“A lot of our kids have gone off the rails because they don’t have proper parenting. The parents are too busy and don’t have time to devote to help teach the children all the values and things they should be teaching them,” Zuercher said. “And on the weekends, they’re so tired taking care of things around the house and the kids don’t get the quality time with parents that they should get.”
Zuercher acknowledged that rising costs have made it difficult for many families to make ends meet without both parents working full-time. She herself went back to work when her daughter was less than 2 years old but was able to leave her with a good friend who was a stay-at-home mom.
“I’m not sure if there’s a policy that would fix the situation or make it better: Things are expensive, housing and child care,” Zuercher said. “There isn’t always a grandparent that can take over and the influence of some teachers doesn’t really go with the ideals of parents. Kids are suffering.”
Both Jennings and Zuercher were among the 66 percent of those who say it’s better for a parent to stay home with children — including majorities of men, women, Republicans and Democrats — who said whichever parent wants to stay home should be the one to stay home.
Those views appear to conflict with the large share of Americans who want a return to traditional gender roles, where the woman is the primary caretaker of children.
“It’s difficult to say in every instance that the mother should be the primary person to stay at home,” Jennings said, adding that “by and large, that’s the case.”
Rodsky said that given the realities of women in the workforce — occupational segregation, lack of paid leave, the pay gap between men and women, for example — Americans who say either parent can stay in the home are likely doing so with the assumption that, more often than not, in heterosexual couples, it will be the woman.
“I think you can say women without having to say women,” Rodsky said. “It’s almost always going to be women.”
Americans’ yearning for a return to traditional gender roles is crucial to understanding why the United States lags behind other wealthy countries in policies like paid parental leave and universal child care. “It’s going to be very, very hard to implement policies that buck that aspirational trend,” she said.
Rodsky said that traditional gender roles, or gender specialization, while an ideal for many Americans, particularly men, is out of reach for more than two-thirds of families because of income inequality, which is only growing.
Kaylia Artis, a 24-year-old from Virginia, said her husband wants her to stay home full-time to watch their children, ages 2 and 6. But she works as a nurse at a hospital and is employed in another part-time retail role, and she said the family cannot afford for her to stop working. Not to mention, she said, she really enjoys it.
“The way things are changing, we both need to be working because we got to be able to pay the rent, the lights, the water, the gas, anything the kids might need, the car,” Artis said. “But my husband’s telling me he’d prefer me to just cook, clean, do everything at home. And I’m like, respectfully, I’m just not that kind of woman.”
Artis believes whichever parent wants to stay home should. But in her specific situation, Artis said she can’t imagine her husband taking over all of the household duties from her.
“Women are being asked to do too much and take on everything,” Artis said. “Us moms are the main ones taking sacrifices for our kids.

,DC,2025-09-25 14:25:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-mass-firings-federal-employees-government-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The White House has sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs. The two-page memo, shared with States Newsroom by a Trump administration official, says any programs that received funding in the “big, beautiful” law will “continue uninterrupted.”But the vast majority of federal departments and agencies need Congress to approve an annual funding bill or a stopgap spending bill before the start of the new fiscal year to keep running. The memo says the employees who run those programs may receive a Reduction in Force notice if lawmakers don’t broker an agreement before the Oct. 1 deadline.  Those reductions will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities,” according to the memo.  “RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the memo states. “RIF notices should be issued to all employees working on the relevant (programs, projects, or activities), regardless of whether the employee is excepted or furloughed during the lapse in appropriations.”Once lawmakers reach a deal and the government reopens, the memo says agencies should rework their reduction in force plans “to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions.”Employee union urges compromiseSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement the memo represents “an attempt at intimidation.”“Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,” Schumer wrote. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley wrote in a statement the memo shows that White House budget director Russ Vought intends “to pursue another DOGE-like round of illegal mass firings in the event of a shutdown, adding to the chaos.” “The truth is simple: Republicans cannot fund the government without Democratic votes. That means the only path forward is compromise,” Kelley wrote. “The president and congressional leaders must sit down and negotiate in good faith to keep the lights on for the American people. Nothing less is acceptable.”Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen wrote in a statement that “Trump is engaged in mafia-style blackmail, with his threats ultimately harming the American people.” “He is threatening to double down on the failed actions of Elon Musk and his chainsaw — going after patriotic civil servants that provide Americans with critical services — despite having to rehire many of these workers after Americans experienced the negative impact of those cuts,” Van Hollen wrote. “These dedicated workers have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy disputes that have brought us to the brink of a shutdown.”House GOP departs until after Oct. 1The House voted mostly along party lines to approve a seven-week stopgap spending bill last week before leaving town. GOP leaders were supposed to bring lawmakers in that chamber back to Capitol Hill on Monday, but extended their break and won’t return until after the shutdown deadline. The move was largely seen as a way to jam the Senate, specifically Democrats, with the short-term government funding bill that they largely oppose because GOP lawmakers wrote it behind closed doors without bipartisan negotiations. The Senate tried to advance the House-passed Republican stopgap bill but didn’t have the necessary 60 votes to move the legislation toward final passage. Democrats have maintained for weeks that if Republican leaders want their support on a short-term spending bill, they should have negotiated with party leaders on key issues, including an extension of the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year but Americans who rely on the marketplace for their health insurance will begin purchasing their plans for next year on Nov. 1. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he views negotiations on those tax credits as an issue for December, not this month, despite the open enrollment period ending on Dec. 15. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said repeatedly he views the issue as separate from government funding.",,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

Mikie Sherrill and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli are in a statistical tie, according to an Emerson College Poll released Thursday.","Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are locked in a tight race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, according to a new poll released Thursday.
Each candidate received 43% from the 935 self-reported likely voters surveyed by Emerson College Polling, marking a slowdown for Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman who has led the contest in every other public poll of the race. Just under 11% of respondents were undecided, and 3% plan to vote for a different candidate.
Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, and Sherrill are vying in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat barred from seeking a third consecutive term.
Spencer Kimball, the poll’s executive director, in a statement noted that poll results show state and federal executives are unpopular.
“Both President Trump and Governor Murphy are underwater among Jersey voters. Sherrill is trying to tie Ciattarelli to Trump, at the national level, and Ciattarelli is trying to tie Sherrill to Murphy and the cost of living at the state level,” Kimball said.
NJ governor hopefuls duke it out at first of two debates

The poll found Murphy holds a 35% job approval rating, with 44% disapproving. Just over a fifth of voters, 21%, said they had no opinion on the two-term governor. Trump’s approval rating is at 41%, with 51% disapproving (9% are unsure.)
The poll found independents favored Ciattarelli 52% to 26%. Republicans (86%) were a little more likely to back their party’s nominee than were Democrats (81%).
Overwhelmingly, voters said the economy (51%) was the most pressing issue facing New Jersey, followed by threats to democracy (13%) and housing affordability (11%).
Few voters named crime (5%) and immigration policy (5%) as a chief issue, though even fewer named abortion access (0.9%).
Trump has been a major issue on the campaign trail, with Democrats warning voters that Ciattarelli would be the “Trump of Trenton.” The new poll says voters narrowly preferred a candidate who would stand up to the Trump administration (51%) to one who would work with it (49%).
Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill have pledged to lower costs for residents plagued by skyrocketing electric bills. The new poll says voters continued to blame utility companies (30%) and the governor (22%) for rising utility rates. Few (7%) said the federal government — which has indefinitely paused New Jersey’s offshore wind projects and regulates New Jersey’s grid operator — was to blame.
Even fewer (4%) said PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, was responsible for rising electricity rates. A little more than a third of voters (35%) said everyone was to blame.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Gov. Janet Mills appears poised to announce a run for U.S. Senate against Republican Susan Collins. In recent weeks, the Democratic governor has been crisscrossing the state, visiting local businesses and leaders, and reportedly interviewing campaign managers to help with her Senate bid.
This comes after months of pressure from national Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, for whom flipping Collins’ seat remains one of the only paths to gaining a Democratic majority in the chamber. 
I understand why they have zeroed in on Mills as their chosen fighter after she gained national attention for confronting President Donald Trump (with a merch-ready tagline to boot), and it’s clear they are eager to thrust her into the ring.
But I want to caution the party against getting over their skis here as Maine voters, Democrats in particular, have been burnt before when the establishment chose a candidate without allowing a primary to play out.
Graham Platner and other Democratic candidates are garnering interest that spans from curiosity to fandom.
Mills is a known entity with a proven record of being a champion of reproductive rights and public health. While she would likely be a solid Democratic vote in Congress, her history on issues including labor rights, gun safety and tribal sovereignty, among others, has left many voters frustrated.
At the same time, many of her likely challengers — Platner, Jordan Wood, Dan Kleban, Daira Smith-Rodriguez — are untested and have a lot of work to do to win Mainers’ support. The more we learn about their platforms, the more opportunity there will be for disagreement.
But with so much hand-wringing about the Democratic Party’s favorability problem (which currently has a polling average of 33.5%), it would behoove those at the top to see who is connecting with voters and who they are excited about before calling the race a done deal.
If there’s one thing we can take from the 2020 Senate race in Maine, when party leaders endorsed Sara Gideon one day after she announced her candidacy, it’s that it takes more than a hefty war chest to best Collins.
It’s very possible that Mills could win the primary on her own. She’s a savvy politician and an experienced leader. But if that’s not what Maine voters are asking for, the national party would be smart to listen.

Baffled and appalled. 
That’s how Minnesota taxpayers should be feeling about their state government in the past week following federal fraud charges, which allege that two separate Medicaid programs were bilked by scammers, even as the feds have continued to charge new defendants in the notorious Feeding Our Future case.
The Reformer was first to report on a wide-ranging federal investigation of the state’s autism treatment program last year, which arose out of the Feeding Our Future food aid scandal that cost taxpayers at least $250 million in federal money. 
The feds had an inkling about the autism program because some Feeding Our Future defendants also ran autism treatment facilities — multitasking! 
The FBI executed search warrants of two operators in December. Now, Asha Farhan Hassan has been charged and plans to plead guilty, according to her attorney, for her role in a $14 million scheme to defraud the autism program. 
Maybe someone at DHS should have noticed that spending on autism was exploding beyond reason: The number of providers — who are supposed to diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder — increased 700% in five years, climbing from 41 providers in 2018 to over 300 in 2023, while spending increased 3,000%, from about $6 million to nearly $192 million — according to DHS data.
When we asked about this in June of 2024, DHS was unperturbed: “I don’t think we are surprised or particularly disturbed by the rate of growth,” said a DHS assistant commissioner. 
(Hilariously, she said the growth was “pretty consistent” with other DHS programs, such as “housing stabilization services,” a program we now know was so riddled with fraud that Gov. Tim Walz moved to shut it down last month.)
Finally, DHS took notice and began investigating autism providers. First, they said they were looking at 15. Then, 29. Following Wednesday’s indictment, DHS released a statement saying they now have 84 open cases, or nearly one-fourth of all providers. 
DHS also said they began on-site visits in 2024 and have examined 342 providers. 
Even after we reported the FBI was on the case in June of 2024, however, DHS didn’t start on-site inspections until the fall — months later. 
Let’s recall a criticism of state government during Feeding Our Future: Even though for-profit companies and nonprofits claimed to be serving hundreds of thousands of meals from addresses linked to apartment buildings, an apartment complex for seniors and a  townhome, among other suspicious sites, the Minnesota Department of Education, which administered the program, never visited them.
And, still, DHS was guilty of the same lax oversight, only beginning site visits years after the autism program launched.  
Let’s go back further, however. In the summer of 2023, we reported that about half of the people who to that point had been charged in the Feeding Our Future case had other state contracts. 
How did DHS respond? The agency told the Reformer — after months of stonewalling — that they’d reviewed the contracts with Feeding Our Future defendants and hadn’t turned up evidence of fraud. 
That wasn’t the only warning DHS should have been wise to, however.  
As the Star Tribune recently reported, DHS was warned, also in 2023, about potential fraud in the aforementioned housing stabilization program, designed to help people secure housing after they’d come out of rehab or were struggling with homelessness. 
According to the Strib, a “caseworker notified the state in September 2023 that Faladcare LLC was falsifying timesheets to receive payments.” 
DHS never investigated, however, “referring it instead to an outside Medicaid administrator.”
The subject of the tip was among eight people charged last week. More charges linked to fraud in that program are likely.  
While DHS was passing the buck, the bucks were flowing: Spending on housing stabilization services — another Medicaid program — skyrocketed in recent years. 
Analysts predicted the program would cost about $2.6 million annually when it was created about five years ago. But in 2021, the program paid out over $21 million in claims, rising to $42 million in 2022, $74 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Mind you: This isn’t paying people’s rent. It’s just helping them find a place to live and counseling them through the at-times difficult process of securing housing after being homeless or coming out of rehab. 
DHS was apparently so clueless as to the potential fraud that the Walz administration “asked the Legislature to fund additional DHS positions to keep pace with the growth,” the Strib reported. “Where it could, DHS moved to speed up processing times and let more individuals into the program.”
It’s like we were putting our cherished Christmas gifts right into the Grinch’s bag of stolen goods.   
A Walz spokeswoman told the Strib last week that “There is an organized crime ring in Minnesota determined to cheat and steal from taxpayers, and we have continued to pass policies to stay ahead of them — and that is why we are seeing people going to prison. It’s why the governor’s administration moved to shut off this entire program.”
Too little, too late. 
I take no joy from the fact that in 2023, I wrote a column warning Democrats of the policy and political ramifications of widespread government fraud: “If government is constantly being hoodwinked and wasting the people’s money on boondoggles, why would voters entrust to Democrats a universal public health insurance program?”
Moreover, in a year when the president is lining his pockets with shady crypto deals and his border czar faces an allegation that he accepted a $50,000 cash bribe, Democrats ought to be running as the party of reform and clean government. 
Instead, in Minnesota, they’ll confront a neverending drip drip of indictments of people alleged to have stolen the people’s money. 
They can’t say they weren’t warned.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-900038802-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)A U.S. District Court judge in Anchorage has ruled against the state of Alaska in an 11-year-old legal dispute that has significant implications for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and state finances.
On Wednesday, Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that laws and regulations setting the western border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are “ambiguous,” but federal regulators made a reasonable decision when they declared the border to be the western bank of the North Slope’s Staines River, rather than on the western bank of the Canning River.
There are 20,000 acres of potentially oil-rich land between the two waterways, and the state of Alaska had sought ownership of the area — sited just to the east of the Prudhoe Bay oil field — for oil and gas drilling.

This map, published by the Alaska Department of Law as part of its summary judgment motion, shows the area contested between the state of Alaska and the federal government. (Screenshot)

While the federal government is now advancing plans for oil and gas leasing in the disputed area, the decision to keep it under federal control means that if oil and gas are discovered there, the state of Alaska would receive far less revenue than it would if it were state-owned land.
“The state of Alaska is disappointed that the court failed to recognize the state’s ownership of this disputed area on the border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” said Patty Sullivan, communications director for the Alaska Department of Law, which brought the case against the federal government. 
“This land may hold significant resource potential for the future of energy for Alaska and the United States and would likely be thoroughly explored and developed under state management. We will evaluate our options and are glad to, at least, have a federal administration currently in place that recognizes the importance of responsible resource development in this area,” she said.
Attorneys for the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Justice did not return messages seeking comment.
The state’s dispute with the federal government revolves around whether federal mapmakers viewed the Staines River as a separate river from the Canning, or simply a “distributary,” a different channel of the same river, in 1957. 
The Bureau of Land Management used the boundary drawn that year to create the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960, and it became the refuge in 1980. Maps published at that time show the border running along the Staines River. 
As Gleason explained in her 74-page order, “If the Staines River was considered to be part of the Canning, then the extreme west bank would follow the west bank of the Staines distributary of the Canning River. But if the Staines and the Canning were considered to be two separate rivers, then the boundary would follow the west bank of western-most channel of the main Canning River.”
The dispute also included a marker designating the northwest, seward boundary of the refuge, but the main issue was about the river-defined border.
In 2014, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources requested ownership “of certain lands west of” the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Alaska Statehood Act, which remains partially unfulfilled more than 65 years after statehood, allows the state to select more than 100 million acres of federal land for state ownership.
In 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded to the state’s request, saying the state had already selected all available land in the area. The state protested, saying that federal officials were drawing ANWR’s border west of where it should have been because they were relying on the Staines River, not the Canning.
The state appealed to the U.S. Interior Board of Land Appeals, which ruled in favor of the BLM. The state sued over the issue in 2022 and won an early victory when Judge Gleason ruled the following year that the land appeals board failed to consider a 1951 map that showed the Staines as a separate river from the Canning.
But in 2024, the land appeals board again ruled against the state, which promptly renewed its case in the U.S. District Court and requested summary judgment, a request that was answered Wednesday.
Explaining her order, Gleason noted a 1906 U.S. Geological Survey dictionary that labeled the Staines and the Canning as the same river, but “on the other hand, some contemporaneous maps label the two rivers separately, indicating that the Staines and the Canning may have been considered to be two separate rivers. And yet other contemporaneous maps do not label the Staines or do not separately label the Canning River at the mouth,” she wrote.
While that might have favored the state’s position, Gleason concluded that the land appeals board’s interpretation of the border was reasonable, not arbitrary, was supported by substantial evidence and wasn’t contrary to law, meaning that the state doesn’t have grounds to overturn it.
Gleason concluded, “the court upholds the IBLA’s finding that the northwest boundary of the refuge follows the Staines River, a distributary of the Canning River.”
If the state chooses to appeal Gleason’s decision, it will have 30 days after final judgment.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8192238026_68ea381f61_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

The Delaware Restaurant Association (DRA) is launching the Council of Hispanic Restaurants (CHR), a new initiative dedicated to supporting Hispanic restaurant owners and operators across the state.
The council will focus on the unique needs of Hispanic food entrepreneurs by providing regulatory updates, networking opportunities, and operational resources vital for long-term sustainability and growth.
According to the National Restaurant Association, Hispanic workers make up 27% of the U.S. restaurant workforce, shaping menus, leading kitchens, and driving innovation. In Delaware, the number of Latino-owned businesses increased from 5% to 6% of all businesses between 2022 and 2023, reflecting growing momentum and a positive impact on the community. 
RELATED STORY: Wilmington Parade Celebrates Hispanic Heritage with Music, Color and Community Spirit – Update
To celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, the DRA is partnering with local Hispanic organizations to host two free community events, offered in both English and Spanish. The sessions are designed for restaurants, food trucks, catering businesses, and food entrepreneurs, and will provide access to resources, state regulatory updates, and connections with agencies such as the Delaware Departments of Health and Labor.
According to the DRA, “The CHR will ensure Hispanic-owned restaurants in Delaware have a dedicated seat at the table — connecting owners with critical resources, culturally relevant guidance, and year-round support.”

Francis Awerkamp, a St. Marys Republican pictured here on March 11, 2025, was the most vocal legislator during a hearing in which gambling industry representatives weighed in on changes to sports betting in Kansas. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislators are considering changes to the way the state taxes sports gambling after receiving less than a 1% cut on more than $2.7 billion in bets in the past fiscal year.
As the expiration dates for contracts between the state and sports wager operators draw nearer, Kansas is confronting an increasingly complex and more profitable gambling climate than when it first legalized sports betting in 2022.
During the 2025 session, the Legislature implemented a last-minute moratorium on the state approving any contract renewals for online sportsbooks. A hearing Monday was the first public discussion of potential changes to Kansas’ sportsbook market since then.
Legislators toyed with the idea of rejiggering the formula that dictates the allocation of sports betting revenues at a Monday hearing in Topeka. Of the $2.7 billion in wagering revenue in fiscal year 2025, which began in July 2024 and ended in June, Kansas retained about $17 million, or 0.6%, according to state data.
Lawmakers also considered changing the way book operators reach customers.
John Pappas, the state advocacy director for iDevelopment and Economic Association, a national trade group for mobile sportsbook operators and technology providers, said during the hearing that Kansas’ model is a success story.
But Rep. Francis Awerkamp, a Republican from St. Marys, said he struggled to accept that notion.
“I guess we represent different people, right?” he said to Pappas. “ You have your clients. I have the people of my district. The people of Kansas.”
In ranking sports wagering tax revenue per $1 million wagered since inception, Kansas ranks 29 out of 33 states.
“This is absolute failure from my perspective,” Awerkamp said.
“What am I not seeing?” he added. “How can you say that this is a success story when we’re basically one of the worst states in the country?”
Pappas said the answer is simple. Success is based on the size of Kansas’ market. For a small population, Kansas’ sports betting revenues are disproportionately large. In Awerkamp’s eyes, the problem is that the revenues are only taxed at 10%.
Six states and Washington, D.C., set different tax rates for online and retail sports betting. Kansas is one of 11 states that tax online and retail sports betting at the same rate of 10% or less. New Hampshire, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island have the highest tax rates at 51%.
Kansans over the age of 21 can bet on more than 50 categories of live and virtual sports, from bull riding to baseball to chess. Casinos in Kansas are allowed to contract with sportsbook operators, of which there are currently six: BetMGM, Caesar’s, DraftKings, ESPNBet, FanDuel and Fanatics.
The 5-year contracts, which include retail and mobile betting, are set to expire around the same time in August 2027. Other states run their own books, or contract directly with book operators.
Existing sportsbook operators and Kansas casinos opposed a change to Kansas’ model. Some cautioned lawmakers about modifying business in Kansas while sportsbooks are expected to begin operating in neighboring states, including Missouri later this year.
Aaron Gomes, president of the parent company to Kansas Crossing Casino in Pittsburg, said in written testimony, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
The casino works with three book operators: Caesars, Fanatics and BetMGM.
“Untethering sports wagering from casinos would not only disrupt these partnerships — it would risk undermining the very institutions that have delivered economic value to Kansas,” said Gomes, who is the chief operating officer of the casino’s owner, Peninsula Pacific Entertainment.
Earlier in the hearing, in discussion with another casino representative, Awerkamp said the sole purpose of the Kansas Lottery is to generate revenue for the state to offset burdens on taxpayers.
“From my perspective, what’s happened is certain organizations have recognized a tremendous opportunity of essentially a constitutionally protected monopoly and tried to get in the process and take a cut,” he said.
The Kansas Lottery was established for the good of the people, Awerkamp said, not the good of the casinos.
 
Raising the stakes
Kansans’ attitudes toward gambling have evolved since the state legalized sports wagering, and problem gambling behaviors have escalated, according to a 2025 study that surveyed more than 1,600 Kansas adults.
It was the first time the survey was conducted since 2017, and it recommended enhancing problem gambling messaging, improving state-funded treatment and gambling screening, regulating gambling advertising, and conducting statewide surveys more frequently.
Around 70% of survey respondents reported gambling, and 34% of respondents said they had gambled in the past month, an increase from 19% who reported gambling in 2017.
“The number of Kansans at moderate or high risk for problem gambling has more than tripled since 2017,” the survey found.
Almost everyone surveyed who was classified as high risk acknowledged they had a gambling problem. Many said gambling caused health, financial and relational problems. Substance use and mental health struggles were more likely for those in the high-risk category than those in the moderate and low-risk categories, the study said. Kansans are also less likely to use a gambling hotline than they were eight years ago.
More Kansans are citing their motivation for gambling as paying bills and escaping everyday problems.

Ed Crockett of Portland is running as an independent in the open race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in November 2026. (Photo courtesy of campaign)Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent. 
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out. 
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year 
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.
Before assuming public office, Crocket had a decades-long career in sales and marketing, leading initiatives for Maine-based companies such as Country Kitchen, Hannaford and Oakhurst Dairy.
Crockett has said his world view was shaped by his childhood growing up on Munjoy Hill in Portland as the youngest of eight children in a family that struggled financially, which he detailed in his memoir released in 2021, “The Ghosts of Walter Crockett,” titled after his father. 
Crockett is also the third Clean Elections candidate, fully funding his campaign with public money under Maine’s Clean Elections Act. 
A bill this past session that sought to expand the fund failed, and the Maine Ethics Commission raised concern about allocations not being enough if more than two gubernatorial candidates run under the program in 2026. Bennett previously told Maine Morning Star that he chose not to run under clean elections because of fear that there wouldn’t be sufficient funding.
Crockett has been a vocal critic of how the state has set its budgets over the past several years, specifically Democrats choosing to pass majority budgets without Republican support. He has argued that that approach puts too much power in the hands of the chief executive while making most of the bipartisan work done in committees fruitless. 
“Maine does not need more partisan fighting,” Crockett wrote on his campaign website. “It needs a governor who can bring people together and move us forward.”

As President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigration, one California school district stands out to ensure all its students — regardless of legal status — can feel safe and access vital resources, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Serving more than 500,000 students, Los Angeles Unified School District is the country’s second largest school district. Within days of Trump’s reelection in November, its school board passed a resolution vowing to protect students from immigration enforcement on campuses.
The district also has a hotline for families seeking assistance related to immigration; provides free legal help through partnerships with local nonprofits; and has a virtual academy for students who are housebound due to fears of deportation.
Amid drops in enrollment and attendance from increased immigration raids, the district organizes volunteers to help escort children to and from school for parents who are afraid to leave their homes. 
These efforts have been led by Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, a former immigrant without legal status. His outspoken defense for immigrant rights has captured the attention of some educators and advocates, who say it’s important that school leaders stand up for their students.

Carvalho, at a recent panel on immigration: “It is my compelling moral responsibility, as well as professional responsibility, to protect all children. On the sidewalks of America, we don’t have some reserved for immigrants and others for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity.”

At the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law last week two measures that aim to protect immigrant students: One prohibits school staff from sharing information about students to immigration authorities without a judicial warrant, and the other requires schools to notify families when immigration officials are on campus.

Data center bills lack bite

California is home to more than 300 data centers, and two bills regulating these power-guzzling facilities now await the governor’s decision, writes CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Both measures have been notably amended since their introduction: One would require data center operators to disclose how much water they estimate their centers will consume whenever they apply for or renew a business license or permit.
Data centers can use hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day as part of their cooling systems, and many facilities are located in drier areas of the state. But one amendment made to the bill would require operators to share their water data with water suppliers — not government officials.
Another bill originally aimed to ensure that utility companies wouldn’t leave customers financially on the hook for the energy infrastructure they build to power data centers. Now, however, the measure only authorizes state regulators to assess whether data centers shift costs to ratepayers — a power the state’s public utility commission already has.

Researchers not deemed ideological match for Trump’s agenda lose grants

Millions of dollars in canceled federal grants have left California researchers and educators in the humanities scrambling for new funding — threatening various projects focused on local history, the immigrant experience, border studies and more.
As Lylah Schmedel-Permanna of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network explains, in April the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled over $10.2 million to projects in California. The agency notified campuses that it “is repurposing its funding allocations … in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
CalMatters found that of all the 29 California campuses that had ongoing NEH-funded projects at that time, every campus but one had their funding cut. Canceled grants ranged from about $23,000 to more than $500,000, though the University of Southern California lost over $1.2 million in total canceled projects.
Cal State San Bernardino lost nearly $150,000 in three-year funding for its “Inland Empire Project,” which would provide a teaching framework that links local history with broader U.S. history. The project is led by historian and professor Michelle Lorimer, who said she was devastated after receiving notice about the grant termination.

Here’s what survived,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/09/data-centers-california-electricity-rates/,"Most plans to regulate data centers died in the state’s Legislature this year, despite a nationwide backlash. Two surviving bills aim to promote disclosure of energy and water use.","In summary
Most plans to regulate data centers died in the state’s Legislature this year, despite a nationwide backlash. Two surviving bills aim to promote disclosure of energy and water use.




California lawmakers started the year signaling they were ready to get tough on data centers, aiming to protect the environment and electricity ratepayers. Nine months later, they have little to show for it.
Of four data center bills in play, two never made it out of the Legislature, including one that would have required data centers to publicize their power use and another that would have provided incentives for them to use more clean energy.
Two others are on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, but in substantially reduced form. One mandates disclosure of water use by data center operators, although now in a way that may elude public access. Another originally aimed to protect energy customers from shouldering infrastructure costs driven by data centers but now merely lets regulators figure out if that is happening.
Data centers have the seemingly mundane job of storing and transmitting the contents of the internet. But the drab, largely windowless facilities are becoming a growing public policy concern. At least one is involved every time you watch a TikTok video or shop on Amazon. 
In recent years, demand for artificial intelligence, and especially new general purpose systems like ChatGPT, caused such server farms to multiply. That means more water to cool semiconductors used to train and deploy AI models and more power plants and transmission lines, leaving state regulators increasingly concerned about stress on reservoirs and potentially higher power bills for residential customers.
Those concerns are not confined to California; communities and regulators in several states have made moves toward transparency requirements or efficiency standards. Michigan in 2024 enacted a law to require water use disclosure and the mayor of St. Louis enacted new rules earlier this month.
California is home to one of the largest concentrations of existing data centers in the world, and more projects are on the way. Pacific Gas and Electric, the largest power supplier in the state, reported this spring that it saw a 40 percent jump in data center hookup requests. In July the California Public Utilities Commission voted to streamline data center project applications.
Protecting your electric bill
One of the bills now with the governor, Senate Bill 57, authorizes the state public utility commission to assess whether data center loads shift costs to other customers like renters and homeowners. 
Initially that bill from Democratic Sen. Steve Padilla of Chula Vista sought protections like those recently approved in Oregon and Ohio to ensure data center costs aren’t passed on to households.
But amendments by the Assembly Appropriations Committee in late August changed the bill to eliminate a special pay structure for data centers. A requirement that the commission assess how data centers shift costs to ratepayers was also reduced to an authorization, effectively granting the utility commission authority that it already had. Commission officials told CalMatters they’re using that power.
“Lobbyists for data centers successfully gutted the bill.”Adria Tinnin, The Utility Reform Network
The changes soured at least one early backer on the bill. The Utility Reform Network supported the proposal initially for its protections of small businesses and residential ratepayers. The group still thinks the governor should sign it into law to track the impact of data centers, but “unfortunately lobbyists for data centers successfully gutted the bill,” said TURN director of race, equity, and legislative policy Adria Tinnin. “It doesn’t allow us to do anything to actually protect ratepayers from the impacts of data centers.”
PG&E initially opposed the bill, but retracted opposition after changes last month. In August, with support from the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E adopted a rule that requires new customers for large projects – two-thirds of which are data centers – to cover initial costs of transmission lines instead of passing those costs on to ratepayers. 
Big Tech-backed organizations such as the Data Center Coalition and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group continue to oppose the bill. They say the state public utility commission already assesses prospective projects.
Tapping in to water metrics
If signed into law, Assembly Bill 93 will require data center operators to share with their water supplier how much water they estimate they will consume when they apply for or renew a business license or permit. It also directs state agencies to develop water use efficiency guidelines and best practices for data centers, and for businesses to self-certify that they comply with them. It was written by Diane Papan, a Democrat from San Mateo and chair of the assembly committee on water, parks, and wildlife. An environmental group last year sued the Bay Area city of Pittsburg over a data center development, citing water concerns. A community group also raised the issue in relation to a data center near the Salton Sea.
The same Big Tech groups that are fighting the consumer cost bill are also opposed to the water legislation, saying sharing water use data could divulge trade secrets and harm the competitive edge of businesses.
Data center water use is a concern in part because many of the facilities are located in drier areas and can consume hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day. From Southern California to San Jose in the Bay Area, roughly 17 data center projects planned in California as of May are in areas where water stress is high or extremely high, according to reporting by Bloomberg.
A Stanford University study released in April found that Los Angeles and Northern California rank among some of the most popular locations in the U.S. for future data center projects, alongside drought-stricken areas fighting over the fast-draining Colorado River like Phoenix and Las Vegas.
Water concerns have been a key reason behind recent opposition to data centers in  Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, said University of Virginia assistant professor Lauren Bridges, who tracks local and state data center regulation across the U.S. “Because we don’t have any information from the industry about specific site usage, it makes it almost impossible to know what’s going on and how it might impact them,” she said.
It’s unclear how much water is consumed by data centers and the AI systems within them, said University of California, Riverside professor Shaolei Ren, a prominent researcher of AI’s impact on the environment and public health. Google and OpenAI have claimed their models use only a few drops of water per query. A study coauthored by Ren, meanwhile, concluded that AI can consume roughly 16 ounces of water in a series of queries by one user in one sitting.
Ren thinks the proposed water regulation will help shed new light on the question while enabling California’s tech industry to continue to thrive.
But it’s not that simple, said Masheika Allgood, a Silicon Valley water activist who has spoken out against a data center project in San Jose and created an online tool to calculate data center water consumption.
An amendment to the bill tells data center operators to share their water use data with water suppliers rather than government officials. Allgood has found that data center operators and most tech companies don’t share details about how much water they take from local aquifers and is not sure water suppliers will either.  Without such data, it will be harder for people who oppose a data center to spark public discussion or organize their community.
“I can look up the applications, that’s public record, but giving it to the water supplier, I have to go to them directly and ask for this information,” she said. “That’s not transparency for people.”
Linda Gordon, an attorney and climate researcher for the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center, said she supports the proposal and legislation that increases transparency of any kind.
In ongoing work Gordon is conducting with Allgood on the environmental impacts of data centers, she’s found gaining access to water use data difficult, and that some water agencies refuse to share that data, citing a court decision decided roughly a decade ago. Since nothing in Papan’s bill specifically addresses whether the data will be available to the public, it’s unclear whether the disclosure in the bill will help inform researchers, journalists and communities concerned about the water consumption of data centers.
She hopes that language in the law that requires the California Department of Water Resources develop efficiency standards will in turn empower local agencies to develop ways to evaluate  the water use footprint of a data center and whether they ought to approve or deny a project.
“More disclosure is great but how that information gets used is also important to understand if it will actually make a difference,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021025-Data-Center-GM-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

Nineteen California campuses are still missing over $5.2 million in canceled humanities grants. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is issuing millions of dollars in new grants, many of which are in celebration of the upcoming 250th anniversary of America’s founding.


California colleges and universities are still missing over $5 million worth of humanities grants, despite one federal district court order to return funds to University of California campuses. For at least 19 other campuses, the money remains out of reach as lawsuits continue to challenge the Trump administration’s abrupt halt of promised funding in April, when the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled over $10.2 million to already-awarded projects in California.
Now campuses must scramble for limited, alternative funding if they want to keep their projects alive.
For students like Kathleen Boswell, a teaching credential student at Cal State San Bernardino, the loss affects their professional advancement. Boswell and fellow teaching credential students were ready to participate in the first cohort of the “Inland Empire Project,” originally to launch this fall. This project would have provided training and curriculum for current and prospective K-12 teachers to use local history to talk about national topics, such as world wars. Boswell especially looked forward to testing new approaches to connect students with American history.
“Kids get really excited when history is in their grasp,” she said. “If they can connect to local history, they can connect to the broader scope of history. It’s a domino effect.”

President Trump announced plans to gut the National Endowment for the Humanities in his most-recent budget, starting with cutting two-thirds of the agency’s staff. The agency is the largest public funder of the humanities nationwide, created alongside the National Endowment for the Arts after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act into law in 1965. The law asserts that the arts are vital to democracy. Ever since, NEH awards represent a coveted prize in the humanities field. 
Earlier this year, the agency announced major ideological shifts for the types of projects it would support to comply with the president’s executive orders. Those orders aim to eliminate federal funding for programs that promote such ideals as diversity, gender equity, and environmental justice.
During the first three days of April, letters went out to most NEH grant recipients stating that their funding was terminated. A letter sent on April 2 to Cal State San Bernardino states that, “NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.” The termination was effective immediately.
CalMatters reached out to all 29 California campuses that had ongoing NEH-funded projects at that time, as listed on the federal grant tracker USA Spending. CalMatters found that every California campus but one had their funding cut by confirming with public information officers at each college and checking the American Historical Association’s database of terminated NEH grants. 
The only campus spared, the California Institute of Technology, confirmed its funding for the Einstein Papers Project remained intact. The collection houses more than 90,000 of Albert Einstein’s written records.
Terminated projects covered a wide variety of topics, from digitizing the history of Catherine the Great at the University of Southern California to the creation of a minor in human rights and border studies at San Diego State University. Some colleges were in the midst of their project spending when they received the news, while others were slated to start in the upcoming months. Canceled grants ranged from about $23,000 to over $500,000. USC’s canceled projects totaled over $1.2 million. 
UC researchers then sued federal agencies. In that case, Thakur v. Trump, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction in June ordering the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Endowment for the Humanities to reinstate grants to the UCs that were not given a grant-specific explanation as to why they were chosen for termination. That case is still ongoing.
Two other lawsuits over the grant cancellations have been filed by humanities groups on behalf of thousands of individual and institutional members. One lawsuit is led by The Author’s Guild and the other by the American Council of Learned Societies. Although the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York consolidated the two cases, the federal judge in both cases granted a preliminary injunction against the NEH in July only for The Author’s Guild case. However, the judge did not order the grants be returned, but instead be held until the case is tried.
As for the other lawsuit led by the American Council of Learned Societies, along with the American Historical Association and Modern Language Association of America, the same judge denied a preliminary injunction, stating they lack standing to sue the NEH for making such institutional cuts as firing employees and discontinuing programs. A hearing in the case is scheduled for today.
Over 40 universities and research institutions in California are members of the American Historical Association, including Cal State Bakersfield, which had to cancel its “California Dreamin’” project.
Jennifer Self, the university spokesperson, told CalMatters in an email that “at this point, the money is on pause and has not been reinstated and everyone is waiting for how this will play out.” Cal State Bakersfield had been awarded $183,000 for a partnership with Bakersfield College to bring high school teachers from around the country to visit historic sites and learn about the history of immigration and agriculture in the Central Valley. Teachers had already been sent their acceptance letters for the workshop when the funding was cut and the project had to be canceled.
Humanities projects take a huge hit
When Michelle Lorimer, the historian and professor at Cal State San Bernardino leading the Inland Empire Project, received the termination notice, she was devastated. For Lorimer, this award represented several months of research, gathering educators and establishing specific programming and curriculum goals. She says the experience has changed the way she looks at federally funded grants.
“I’m not going to apply for federal funding right now for the work that we’re doing. That would be a waste of time,” Lorimer stated. “ It’s really time-consuming writing these applications, so honestly it would need to be something that I’d feel confident that we’d have a shot at — not something I’m trying to pigeonhole our work into.”
The NEH initially approved the Inland Empire Project for nearly $150,000 to roll out over a period of three years. The project was to create a framework of teaching that uses local history as a method to demonstrate broader U.S. historical topics, such as segregation, redlining and environmental injustice. Teachers in local schools, as well as aspiring history teachers from Cal State San Bernardino, would have received this curriculum and tools to use in classrooms.

Lorimer has looked for alternative funding, but grants of this size are rare and she anticipates that private grants will only get more competitive. Certain private grants are by invite only. Lorimer said that although her college is a member of the American Historical Association, she is not getting her hopes up that the funds might be returned.
Michael Kerp, an assistant professor at Cal State San Bernardino, had planned to create curriculum about the Salton Sea, focusing on environmental and civil rights. He said that the cuts don’t just hurt the university, but the surrounding community. 
“There are thousands of high school students who would have benefited from learning about their communities, understanding how to make change in their communities and working closely with their teachers and local leaders in the region,” Kerp said. “Underserved school districts had this opportunity, and now it’s gone.”
Kerp plans on helping Lorimer downsize the project, and has been able to secure some smaller philanthropic funding through the university. He agrees that applying for future federal funding under the current administration is likely a waste of time. 
Other projects halted include $171,000 for an institute at San Jose State open to K-12 teachers, librarians, and administrators highlighting the immigrant experience through history and literature. Another project was awarded to Saint Mary’s for over $50,000 for an architectural and engineering assessment of the Saint Mary’s College Museum of Art building with the goal of someday making it the first carbon-neutral building on campus while preserving their collections. Cal State Dominguez Hills was to receive $141,000 to conduct an ethnographic study of Chat GPT’s influence in California and Hawaiian classrooms. 
Three California private universities receive new NEH grants
Despite Trump’s calls to dismantle the NEH, the organization announced on Sept. 15 it is awarding $10.4 million, the largest single grant it has ever awarded, to the New York-based Jewish organization Tikvah to “examine Jewish history, culture and identity in the broader context of Western history,” according to a NEH press release. In August, the NEH also announced that it merged seven grantmaking offices into four divisions and appointed new heads to those divisions. 
Since May, the agency has also allocated over $44 million in grants to universities and organizations for research and preservation projects, including for an initiative called “A More Perfect Union,” which celebrates the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. Three California private universities have received these new grants.
Two awards were given to the University of Southern California — $60,000 for the development of a book on the history of Jerusalem from 1099–1187 and over $249,000 to process and digitize historical archives relating to Southern California’s first African American Baptist church. The university had four NEH projects spanning over $1 million cut in the spring for programs including a history project that would have created an augmented reality of a long-lost Chinatown area of Los Angeles. Another project would have funded 18 academic conversations between humanities experts and the public regarding the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and reframing the conversation in a way that is inclusive of underrepresented groups like Native Americans. 
A single award was given to National University, a private nonprofit university located in San Diego, in the amount of $100,000 for a project titled, “Legacies of War: Memorials and Memories of the American Civil War & the Vietnam War.” Pepperdine University, a private Christian university located in Malibu, also received $30,000 for a project focused on the role of Christianity and the bible in the “American founding.” 
Given the new executive orders limiting the scope of what is now acceptable for a federally funded grant, the NEH website gives the following advice to prospective applicants: “We encourage you to read the relevant Executive Orders and consider whether your project’s topic — jointly with its goals, methodology, activities, and intended audience — seems allowable.”

If it’s a matter of personal experience, then yes.
Two years ago he paid $20,000 to a bail bond agent in Atlanta to avoid being locked up in Fulton County Jail pending trial on racketeering charges and more than a dozen other counts in connection with his alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. 
No other president has had such an intimate encounter with the pretrial justice system.
But he still doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
That became clear last month when he issued two executive orders purporting to abolish what he calls “cashless bail.” One order applies to the District of Columbia, which is now being patrolled by National Guard troops under Trump’s direction.
The other bail decree supposedly covers every other U.S. jurisdiction — thousands of them — where people are accused of crimes and arrested.
We’ve now passed the 30-day period that Trump gave his team to submit a list of cities, counties and states that have “substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from custody” for several broad categories of crime. 
Will California be on the list? Maybe, maybe not. Could Trump compel California and its 58 superior courts to change their pretrial release protocols? The answer ought to be no, but so many people and institutions — law firms, universities, Congress, television networks — have shamefully and unnecessarily bent to Trump’s will that it’s hard to say. 
Like every state, California has its own constitution, its own courts and its own rules on money bail. Those rules are complex. They’re different in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento from the rest of the state. And the rules are different for the two times bail can be set: the two or three days between a suspect’s arrest and their first court appearance, and the period leading up to trial, which could be weeks, months or even years later.
California’s practices also have been reshaped by recent voter and court action and may be further affected by a state Supreme Court ruling expected any day now.
Trump has no authority to butt into any of this. But he’s butting in anyway, by threatening to withhold federal funding unless states and local jurisdictions that have taken cash bail off the table reinstate it. 
Trump’s basic premise, although demonstrably false, appears to be that money and the fear of losing it will make potentially dangerous people alter their behavior. He may believe, as do many in law enforcement, that criminal defendants will show up for all their court dates and avoid misconduct to protect their pocketbooks. Defendants with no money at stake presumably would have nothing to lose and therefore put the rest of us at risk because, as Trump said, “they know our laws will not be enforced.” 
For proof, he cited a report prepared by the Yolo County District Attorney’s Office and promoted by District Attorney Jeff Reisig. The report looked at 100 people let out of jail without paying bail during the COVID emergency and compared their subsequent arrest records with 100 people who were released after paying bail in prior years.
A succession of criminologists has refuted the Yolo report in court testimony, declarations and articles, criticizing its methodology and offering numerous peer-reviewed studies finding no evidence that putting up money as a condition of release has any effect on pretrial behavior.
But proponents of money bail have made sure that it’s the faulty Yolo report, and not the peer-reviewed data and studies, that makes it to the desks of news editors. And, apparently, the White House. 
How bail actually works
Rooted in medieval England, money bail historically has served a single purpose — to guarantee that a defendant appears in court for trial and all the required pretrial hearings. U.S. courts now also impose bail in an attempt to protect witnesses and the community from risky defendants.
Most people released on bail, like Trump in 2023, never actually pay bail. They pay a fee, typically 10%, to a bail bond agent, who pledges the full amount to the court. If Trump’s racketeering trial were to go forward, there would be nothing he could do — no number of court appearances, no agreements to stop saying nasty things on social media or anything else — that would get him his $20,000 fee back. As with any other defendant who paid a private bond agent, there was no monetary incentive that would have affected his behavior before trial.
If instead of hiring a bond agent, Trump had pledged or paid the full $200,000 bail amount to the court, he’d get it all back after showing up for trial. In the relatively rare case of a defendant posting the full bail amount, that theoretically is a monetary incentive to not flee.
In fact, most people who don’t show up for trial aren’t desperate crooks on the lam; they’re defendants living on the economic or social margins who were distracted by medical appointments or childcare or mental health crises or, perhaps, they just need the kind of reminder that dentists send their patients. Or a ride to the courthouse.
Santa Clara County pioneered a pretrial services program that helps defendants get to court. Under the 2021 California budget bill, the Judicial Council offers funds to other counties to do similar work. Los Angeles’ program was developed alongside an entire complex of programs to promote “care first; jail last.”
Does a defendant who paid the full bail or a fee to a bail bond agent have a monetary incentive not to be arrested for another crime? The crux of the Trump bail order is that the presumed answer is “yes” — but the actual answer is “no.”
Unlike failure to appear, being arrested does not result in a defendant losing bail money. How could it? An arrest while awaiting trial is not proof of misbehavior. Until conviction, it is only an accusation by the government. In the United States, a defendant cannot be penalized, thank goodness, based merely on an accusation.
It is understandable, although ironic, that the same defendant can indeed be returned to jail upon that second arrest because he or she is no longer considered a low risk to public safety. The law does not consider jail before trial to be a punishment, but merely a safeguard.

A person who posts money bail and is free before trial is in exactly the same position as a person who is free without posting bail. Neither has more or less incentive than the other to behave or misbehave. Paying bail and then losing it doesn’t protect anyone. 
As is the case with many proponents of money bail, Trump’s purpose may be only ostensibly to alter the defendant’s behavior while awaiting trial. The actual purpose is more likely to keep people locked up, whether or not they pose any risk of fleeing or causing public harm.
California eliminated money bail in 2018, but the legislation was overturned two years later in a referendum funded by the bail bond industry and backed, as is often forgotten, by reformers who feared that the state would end up like the federal justice system, where people are locked up who could have been safely released before trial.
In the landmark 2021 case of In re Humphrey, the California Supreme Court ruled that defendants could not be held before trial solely because they could not afford bail. The court has yet to consider how to reconcile the state constitutional right to bail with a provision of Marsy’s Law, a 2008 victims rights ballot measure that requires judges to primarily consider public safety when settling bail. A ruling on the follow-up case, In re Kowalczyk, is expected soon.
California’s differing, two-phase approach
In the meantime, lawsuits in three counties have sharply reduced the use of cash bail after arrest but before arraignment (the defendant’s first appearance in court).
Observers in many other states are puzzled by California’s two-phase bail system. In Philadelphia, for example, almost immediately after arrest a defendant appears before a judge — often by video — to enter a plea and make a case for release without bail, or at least a low bail amount. Except for the video appearance, this is how it works in most TV police procedurals like “Law and Order.”
But it’s not how it works in California, where defendants’ rights to a defense lawyer, an impartial judge and pretrial release are merely theoretical for at least the first 48 hours. During that time, police check the bail schedule, refer defendants to a list of bail bond agents and, if they can’t pay right away, send them to jail. They don’t see a judge, can’t argue for release and usually don’t even meet their public defender until two or three days later, when they have the first chance to enter their plea. At that point, the judge may set bail all over again.
After a lawsuit challenged the process in Los Angeles County, the L.A. Superior Court adopted a new protocol for the pre-arraignment period. Defendants still don’t see judges during that time. But judges, working from home, review the circumstances of the arrest and any criminal records and decide whether to hold or release the defendants without bail. People accused of violent or serious crimes are not eligible for the program yet still can go free immediately if they pay bail.
Lawsuits in San Francisco and Sacramento have led to similar modest changes in the pre-arraignment phase. It’s not clear whether those jurisdictions will end up on Trump’s list of punishable “cashless bail” jurisdictions.
What is Trump playing at?
Except in Illinois, which completely swept away cash bail and now releases or retains people based on their risk of fleeing or of being a threat to public safety, and a few other states like New Jersey and New York, where cash bail remains the exception — Americans continue to enjoy many of their constitutional rights only in proportion to how much money they have.
Defendants with a lot of money can post a lot of cash but get it all back at the end of trial. Those with just a little cash must pay a nonrefundable bail bond agent fee, and those with no money go to jail — and lose their jobs for failure to come to work, or their apartments for being unable to pay their rent, or their children for not being on hand to care for them. Many plead guilty rather than fight the charges, just to go home. Now with criminal convictions, their prospects in life are greatly diminished.
Why does Trump want this?
It may be because, like most Americans, he is clueless about how bail works. Or it could be because, like many police and prosecutors, he believes the justice system taught in school is just a fairy tale and the real system is meant to impose punishment from the moment of arrest,  except for people with money.
Or he could be planning to lock up people just for protesting. It is noteworthy that his executive order listing crimes that should require money bail includes, along with violent and sexual crimes, “vandalism.”
Or it could be that he just considers bail reform to be “woke,” and therefore something to wreck.
None of that is especially surprising.
What is surprising is that so many liberal Americans buy the groundless argument that people who leave jail without paying a bail bond agent are somehow more dangerous than their counterparts who pay. And that their constitutional rights aren’t worth fighting for.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/11022022-Bail-Bonds-RL-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

LA Unified Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, himself formerly an immigrant without legal status, has been outspoken in his support of immigrant families.


As the Trump administration has ratcheted up immigration enforcement, school districts across the country have rallied to support students and families without legal status. But perhaps none more so than Los Angeles Unified.
The nation’s second largest school district — under the guidance of Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, himself formerly an immigrant living in the country illegally – has emerged as a national model for how school districts can help families gripped by fear.
“I think L.A. Unified is at the top of the list for folks looking at what schools are doing right now,” said Sophia Rodriguez, associate professor at New York University who’s studied the topic. “We’re seeing individual teachers and schools push back, but this effort cannot fall on the backs of heroic educators. It has to happen at the district level, like L.A. Unified.”
L.A. Unified catapulted itself to the forefront of the issue within days of Trump’s election in November. At its first school board meeting after the election, the board unanimously passed a resolution vowing to protect students from immigration enforcement on campuses. Since then, the district has rolled out a slew of other services: a 24-hour hotline for families seeking help; a “compassion fund” to help families facing economic emergencies; free legal assistance through local nonprofits; online and in-person workshops addressing immigrants’ legal rights; and a virtual academy for students who’re afraid to leave the house due to the risk of deportation. 
Families can get red cards outlining their legal rights in case they’re detained, as well as mental health counseling and medical care at 19 wellness centers located on school campuses. The district also encourages families to create emergency plans in case a parent is detained. 
Those moves are in addition to statewide efforts to keep schools safe. Guidance from Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta reminded schools that immigration officers need a judicial warrant before entering a school campus. Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, last week signed a bill that prevents school staff from disclosing information about students or their families to immigration authorities without a judicial warrant. He also signed a bill requiring schools to notify families and the community when immigration officials are on campus.
Outspoken superintendent
These steps are helpful, advocates said, but Carvalho’s outspoken defense of immigrant families might be even more powerful. At a time when some civic leaders are shying away from controversy, Carvalho has repeatedly spoken out and made clear that protecting immigrant students is a priority.
“As a proud American by choice — not by chance — and as a formerly undocumented immigrant, it is my compelling moral responsibility, as well as professional responsibility, to protect all children,” Carvalho said at a recent panel on immigration. “On the sidewalks of America, we don’t have some reserved for immigrants and others for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity. … The day we abandon that we might as well bring down the arm of Lady Liberty, extinguish the flame, and tell everyone, ‘I’m sorry, America’s democracy is closed.’”
An immigrant from Portugal, Carvalho was living illegally in the country for  his first few years in the United States in the 1980s. He had moved to the U.S. alone after he graduated from high school, in hopes of escaping poverty and finding more opportunities for education and a career, according to a New York Times profile. While living on the East Coast, he struggled with housing and the fear of deportation, but eventually obtained a student visa and went on to become a high school science teacher in Florida and gain citizenship. He served as superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools before taking over at Los Angeles Unified in 2021.
Carvalho’s words are important, particularly amid the current political climate, said 
Mayra Lara, Southern California director of partnerships and engagement at the research and advocacy nonprofit EdTrust West. Lara was once a student living in the country illegally in Los Angeles Unified and later worked as a high school English teacher in the district. 
“I’ve been impressed with what the district has done, but the superintendent has been especially vocal,” Lara said. “Having a leader who has the courage to speak out makes an incredible difference.”

Students living in the country illegally often feel isolated, afraid to reveal their stories for fear of deportation, she said. Lara felt school, especially English class, was a safe place where she could be herself. 
“School saved me. That’s why it’s so important that schools do what they can to help families right now,” Lara said. “All school districts should be doing what LAUSD is doing.”
Effect on enrollment
Like all school districts in California, Los Angeles Unified doesn’t ask students about their immigration status. But immigrant rights groups estimate that about 1 in 5 students, or 76,000, in the district come from mixed-status families, meaning that at least one parent lacks legal status. 
Enrollment this year has dipped, in part due to the immigration crackdown, Carvalho said. Some families have moved away and some are keeping their children home from school. Attendance has also faltered as raids have increased. That’s led the district to send staff — including the superintendent — to visit 2,000 students’ homes and call more than 14,000 families to assure them that their children are safe at school.
The district has created so-called safe passages to school: volunteers who escort children to and from school for parents who are afraid to leave their homes.
Still, the district can do more, said Maria Miranda, vice president of United Teachers Los Angeles, the teachers union. More outreach to families, so they know what’s available to them, and larger zones around campuses monitored by volunteers, should be a priority, she said. The union would also like to see a stronger alert system to notify parents of nearby immigration enforcement activities, as well as more school staff available to assist students who immigrated to the U.S. alone.
“I think it’s great the superintendent supports students and the district deserves credit,” Miranda said, noting that the union has long pushed for these measures. “It’s been beautiful to see the community come together to protect our democracy. … It’s not OK for students to go into hiding and therefore not have access to school.”
‘My job is to teach kids’
Rodriguez, who teaches at NYU’s Steinhardt School, has extensively researched schools and immigration. She’s not surprised Los Angeles Unified has been a leader in supporting students after immigration enforcement spiked in Los Angeles. Public schools in Chicago, where Trump has recently ordered an immigration crackdown, have also taken extra measures to protect families.
But even school districts in conservative areas have taken steps to protect immigrant students, Rodriguez said. Their superintendents might not be as outspoken, and they might use different terminology and strategies, but the services and commitment to students’ welfare are there, she said.
Patricia Gandara, an education professor at UCLA, agrees.
“Our research has shown that superintendents in red states might be thinking, ‘I don’t disagree with Trump’s policies, but my job is to teach kids,’” Gandara said. “In general, superintendents everywhere are far more concerned about their undocumented students than you’d imagine.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091525_Mayra-Lara_ZS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill still remembers one of the most difficult calls of his time as a public prosecutor. It was an elderly woman with a severely mentally ill adult child. 
Without access to many resources and feeling increasingly exhausted as she and her husband got older, she asked an unimaginable question — what felonies could her son commit to get help from the county’s mental health court?
“That experience reminded me, early on, the impact of mental illness, not only on families and loved ones, but how broken our institutional support had been,” Gill said during a criminal justice and mental health symposium on Wednesday.

The largest mental health facilities in the U.S. are New York City’s Rikers Island, Twin Towers Jail in Los Angeles and Cook County Jail in Chicago, demonstrating that the criminal justice system is a critical mental health provider, Gill said. 
There is a disproportionate presence of people with mental illnesses in jail, compared to the general population, Gill said. And nearly 25% of all police shootings involve an encounter with a mentally ill person — but that’s a number he said he may contest, since in his experience overseeing reviews of over 150 officer-involved shootings in the last 15 years, Gill believes that percentage has been higher.
In this scenario, and with underfunded mental health centers and a reliance on low-level courts to manage mentally ill offenders, Gill said the state needs to think about the resources it puts forward for the federally-proposed expansion of civil commitment. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

Utah is already studying ways to increase its number of civil commitment beds, with a proposal to add over 300 beds to the state’s new homeless services campus in northwest Salt Lake City, a measure that could be a step for the state’s response to Trump administration’s controversial “Ending Crime And Disorder On America’s Streets” order.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has also called for a mental health expansion in the state, arguing there should be more resources for patients “who are killing themselves slowly on our streets.”
With the lack of infrastructure to serve this population, it should come as no surprise that many patients who have lost shelter and access to medications may drink in excess or use illicit drugs, Gill said.
“The criminalization of public health issues became our norm. You and I would not criminalize somebody with heart disease, you and I would not criminalize somebody for having diabetes,” Gills said. “Unfortunately, mental illness, driven by shame, stigma and fear, continues to be criminalized, even today.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Added to that, city justice courts, which handle low-level offenses like public intoxication, trespassing, disorderly conduct and camping, among others, don’t have the resources to address the complexity of individuals with mental illnesses either, Gill said.
Missing a court appearance, for example, could escalate a case, overwhelming the mentally ill population with a cycle of warrant after warrant.
“I think we need to recognize and acknowledge that systemic failure,” Gill said. “And please, when I say this, I am not trying to blame anyone. I’m just trying to share an observation, because if we do not honestly make an observation, we will never be in a place to effectuate the change that I know that all of you and all of us talk about.”
The county has also signed a contract with the Leifman Group — a consulting firm led by Steven Leifman, a retired judge who has developed substantial criminal justice reforms for people experiencing mental illness in Miami Dade County — to identify gaps in Salt Lake’s system.
“We really are focused on this work. And I’ll tell you, I’ve worked on it every day. Keeps me up at night. My brain is constantly thinking about it because I don’t like the outcomes that we’re seeing. And I also know that criminal justice is not the space where we want people to land,” Kelly Colopy, director of the Salt Lake County Human Services Department said.

But that uncertainty meant halting the program, which administrators are now trying to restart.
Upward Bound is a six-week program for students who come from low-income families as well as first-generation college students. The program provides students with tutoring, test preparation and college campus tours among other services.
On Sept. 18, Central Alabama Community College (CACC) President Jeff Lynn said he received a letter from the federal government stating that the institution will receive funding for Upward Bound.

“I can confirm we have been awarded $394,765.00 for this fiscal year for Upward Bound. We look forward to changing more lives for the better,” Lynn wrote in a statement on Monday.
That followed weeks of uncertainty. Before funding was secured, a Facebook post made by a parent on Sept. 4 showed a letter sent out by CACC Upward Bound Director Rachel Harmond stating that the program would have to halt operations for the remainder of the month.
“We regret to inform you that Upward Bound will no longer be able to provide in-school services, CACC campus events and or programming,” the letter said . “The program has been supported by the U.S. Department of Education, and due to delays in funding, we are unable to continue.”
CACC’s Upward Bound program serves students attending high schools in Talladega, Shelby and Coosa County. The program currently serves 77 students.
In a letter to Congress in May, Russell Vought, the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget proposed slashing funding for TRIO and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) because college is not “the obstacle it was for students of limited means.”
A message seeking comment was left with the U.S. Department of Education Wednesday.
Lynn said on Sept. 10, prior to the restoration of funds, that the program is needed to help schools and there were other federally funded programs offered that still had funding.
“The key thing is that we’ve got to touch all of the different students that are in the school system,” he said. “We do have funding for [Student Support Services-STEM], we just don’t have it for Educational Talent Search and Upward Bound right now.”
Kimberly Jones, the president of Council for Opportunity in Education, a nonprofit based in Washington D.C. dedicated to assisting first-generation, low-income and students with disabilities go to college, said in an interview the goal of Upward Bound and other programs under TRIO is to not only get students in college, but to help them complete it.
“I just talked to somebody and they told me they were an Upward Bound student, and when they got to college, they didn’t have a true [Upward Bound] program at their college but they found themselves having difficulties and they reached back out to their Upward Bound counselors for support, guidance and coaching to get them through the semester,” she said.
As of Wednesday, Lynn said CACC is still looking into when to resume Upward Bound.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/College-graduates-holding-diplomas-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469
,California,2025-09-25 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Longtime frenemies Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom reach career crossroads,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/kamala-harris-gavin-newsom-frenemies/,Harris and Newsom quickly climbed political ladders in California to ultimately pursue the presidency. At times they've supported or rivaled each other.,"Three decades ago, thanks to the patronage of legendary San Francisco politician Willie Brown, two young, ambitious politicians launched careers that have taken them into the upper strata of American politics.
As state Assembly speaker, Brown appointed Kamala Harris, with whom he had a personal relationship, to two well-paying state boards and in 1998, as mayor of San Francisco, helped her land a job in the district attorney’s office.
That career move led to her becoming district attorney in 2004, California attorney general six years later and a U.S. senator six years after that. After her four years in the Senate (and a failed 2020 presidential run) Joe Biden made her his vice presidential running mate in 2020 and, finally, endorsed her as his successor in 2024, only to see her lose to Donald Trump.
It was an extremely fast climb up the political ladder, from local civil servant to presidential nominee, but Brown’s other protégé, Gavin Newsom, was also climbing quickly.
In the early 90s, Newsom had founded a restaurant-wine-hotel business called Plumpjack, the title of an opera written by oil fortune heir Gordon Getty, whose personal trust provided early financial support.
In 1996 Mayor Brown appointed the young businessman to the city’s Parking and Traffic Commission, then to the city Board of Supervisors, setting up Newsom’s successful campaign for mayor in 2003.
Newsom wanted to run for governor in 2010 but stepped aside when former Gov. Jerry Brown decided he wanted another crack at governing California. Newsom, with obvious reluctance, ran for lieutenant governor and bided his time in the powerless office until Brown retired again, allowing Newsom to claim the governorship in 2018.
Now, a year after Harris lost her second presidential bid, the two politicians whose relationship has always featured elements of both mutual support and rivalry, find themselves at a crossroads.
Harris is promoting her book about the presidential campaign, “107 Days,” which digs into other politicians, including Newsom. She wrote that she tried to reach Newsom after Biden’s decision not to seek re-election but Newsom’s reply was “Hiking. Will Call Back.”
“He never did,” Harris added.
Newsom later told reporters that an unknown number popped up on his phone that day, and only later did he realize it had been Harris. “That exact same moment, was working with my team to draft a statement,” he said. “I assume that’s in the book as well.”
Harris’ book did not mention Newsom’s endorsement.
As Harris peddles her book she brushes aside questions about running again in 2028, but Newsom is no longer hiding his ambition to climb the final rung on the nation’s political ladder three years hence.
He already claims the role of Donald Trump’s most strident critic, trolling the president with snide and sometimes vulgar social media postings, and denouncing virtually every presidential decree.
Newsom is also sponsoring a November ballot measure, Proposition 50, that would, if successful, shift five California congressional seats from Republicans to Democrats to thwart Republican gerrymanders as the parties vie for control of the House of Representatives next year.
On Tuesday, Newsom took his crusade to a very friendly venue, Stephen Colbert’s talk show, fielding the host’s softball questions and running through his litany of Trump’s sins.
“This guy is flooding the zone, dominating the narratives. Facts don’t seem to matter, and Democrats, frankly, have had a difficult time pushing back,” Newsom told Colbert.
Newsom couldn’t resist taking an oblique shot at Harris for her losing campaign, without naming her. “As the Democratic Party, we have a lot of work to do to make up for our failures in the past,” he said. “We got crushed in this last election.”
The remark reflected what has been — and obviously still is — a decades-long relationship of frenemies.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/090821_harrisnewsom_AW_sized_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C710&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

After a fight with a Black student in a St. Louis suburb left a white student badly injured in March 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey blamed their school district for unsafe conditions, even though the incident occurred after classes and more than a half-mile from campus.

Bailey seized on the fight as evidence of what he called the Hazelwood School District’s misplaced priorities. He sent a letter to the superintendent demanding documents on the district’s diversity policies and accused leaders of “prioritizing race-based policies over basic student safety.” Bailey argued that the district’s dispute with local police departments over its requirement that officers participate in diversity training — an impasse that resulted in some departments leaving schools without resource officers — had left students vulnerable.
In response, the school board’s attorney said Bailey had misrepresented basic facts: The district employed dozens of security guards at schools where it could not assign resource officers, and even if it did have police officers stationed at the school, those officers would not have handled an after-hours, off-campus fight. Finally, police found no evidence that race played a role in the fight.
The attorney general’s office took no further action.
“He was just trying to get attention,” said school board President Sylvester Taylor II.
The legal skirmish was the kind of publicity-getting move that defined Bailey’s two years and eight months as Missouri’s attorney general before his surprise selection last month by President Donald Trump as a co-deputy director of the FBI, according to experts who study the work of attorneys general.
As Missouri’s top law enforcement officer, Bailey repeatedly waded into fights over diversity, gender, abortion and other hot-button issues, while casting conservatives and Christians as under siege by the “woke” left.
Bailey had pledged at the start of his tenure in early 2023 not to use the state’s open public records law “as an offensive tool” to demand bulk records from school districts in broad investigations — a tactic used by his predecessor, Eric Schmitt, now a U.S. senator. Still, he made frequent use of cease-and-desist letters, warning school districts that their diversity initiatives or handling of gender and sex-education issues violated the law.
Some efforts, like his letter to the Hazelwood School District, amounted to little more than a press release. Others ended in defeat, with judges calling his arguments unpersuasive or “absurd” or, in one case, dismissing them without comment. One lawsuit, against China, ended in a judgment against the country that experts said will likely never be enforced.
Bailey, who was sworn in to the FBI position on Sept. 15, did not respond to messages left with the FBI’s press office and with James Lawson, a longtime friend who managed his attorney general campaign and served in various roles on his staff.
Bailey’s actions as attorney general, according to legal observers, stood apart from the office’s core, nonpolitical duties: defending the state against lawsuits and handling felony criminal appeals. That work, by most accounts, continued as usual.
His Republican predecessors, Schmitt and, before him, Josh Hawley, also used the position to advance conservative causes, wage fights against progressive ones and raise their national profiles.
During his stint as attorney general, Hawley — like Schmitt now in the U.S. Senate — delivered a speech in which he claimed the elimination of social stigmas to premarital sex and contraception during the 1960s had degraded the treatment of women and promoted sex trafficking. And he fought to uphold state restrictions that threatened to shut down Planned Parenthood clinics four years before Missouri’s near-total abortion ban took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Schmitt was named to succeed Hawley in November 2018. During his four years in office, he defended Christian prayer in public schools and sued several local school districts that had enforced mask requirements during the pandemic.
In 2022, he joined a small group of conservative attorneys general in withdrawing from the National Association of Attorneys General, a bipartisan group that had long coordinated multistate investigations in cases against industries ranging from tobacco to opioids. In a letter posted to the social media platform now known as X, Schmitt joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen in arguing that NAAG had taken a sharp “leftward shift” and that continued membership was intolerable. Neither Hawley nor Schmitt, through their spokespeople, responded to requests for comment.
Chris Toth, the executive director of NAAG who retired from the organization weeks after the letter became public, said in an interview that the claims in the letter were “completely unsupported by facts.” Republicans, he added, were involved “in every facet of the organization.”
The move reflected a broader shift in how many attorneys general now use their offices — not only to defend their states in court, but to score political points on the national stage. Few have embodied that strategy more than Paxton, who has often been described as focusing on culture war issues as attorney general.
ProPublica and The Texas Tribune have reported how Paxton has transformed the attorney general’s office into an agency that seems less focused on traditional duties like representing other state offices in court to one preoccupied with fighting culture wars. His office has increasingly used the state’s powerful consumer protection laws to investigate organizations whose work conflicts with his political views. At the same, he’s started increasingly outsourcing major cases to private law firms.
Paxton’s office has said most of the instances when it declined to represent a state agency were due to practical or legal limits — some agencies chose their own attorneys; others were barred by statute. He’s also argued that certain cases would have required reversing earlier positions or advancing claims he viewed as unconstitutional. He’s defended hiring outside law firms, saying his office lacks the resources to take on powerful industries like tech and pharmaceuticals. Paxton did not respond to a request for comment.
Bailey, though far less prominent nationally, fit squarely within this mold. Before leaving for the FBI, he spoke openly about protecting Missourians from what he called “woke” ideology and lawlessness from the left.
A former U.S. Army officer, he has often framed his mission in combat terms. In a podcast interview this year, he said that while conservative states generally try to limit the power of their attorneys general to “maximize freedom,” blue states have weaponized their offices.
“I mean, Letitia James in New York has every weapon in her arsenal that her general assembly can give her,” he said in the podcast interview. He said she uses them “to mess with people’s lives, to prosecute President Trump, take him to court in civil law to try to seize his assets and undervalue those assets.”
“Missouri is uniquely positioned because we were so recently a blue state,” he said, “so it’s like a retreating army has left the battlefield and dropped their weapons and we’re picking them up and learning how to use them against them.”
A spokesperson for James’ office said that “any weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American” and that it stood behind its litigation against Trump’s business and would continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.
Bailey said in the podcast interview that he supported all efforts to investigate President Joe Biden, his family and his administration, and to uncover what Bailey called the truth behind the COVID-19 vaccine, which he said “seems to not be a vaccine at all.”
Bailey used his office to investigate the nonprofit media watchdog Media Matters for America after it reported that corporate ads were appearing next to extremist content on the social media platform X.
Stephen Miller, a top aide to Trump in his first administration, posted that conservative state attorneys general should investigate; Bailey quickly responded that his team was “looking into the matter.” Weeks later, he issued a “notice of pending investigation” to Media Matters and ordered it to preserve records. He later accused the group of using fraud to solicit donations from Missourians to bully advertisers out of pulling out of X, and demanded internal records and donor information under Missouri’s consumer protection law. In a June 2024 interview with Donald Trump Jr., Bailey described the probe as “a new front in the war against the First Amendment” and tied it directly to the 2024 election, accusing Media Matters of trying to silence conservative voices.
Media Matters sued and a federal judge blocked the investigation as likely retaliatory. In early 2025, Bailey dropped the case in a settlement and said he had not found evidence of financial or other misconduct by Media Matters. The organization did not respond to a request for comment.
When Trump was awaiting sentencing after being convicted in a New York court of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, Bailey asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a gag order on the former president and delay his sentencing until after the 2024 election, arguing the restrictions kept Missouri voters from hearing Trump’s message. The Supreme Court rejected his request in an unsigned one-page order without explanation. A New York judge later postponed the sentencing until after the election, writing that he wanted to avoid the appearance, however unwarranted, of political influence.
Trump could have faced up to four years in prison, but a judge issued an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction in place but sparing him any penalty or fine. Trump said the conviction was a “very terrible experience” and an embarrassment to New York. He is appealing.
Bailey also fought to keep a woman in prison even after a state court judge declared her innocent. Even after the state Supreme Court ordered her release, Bailey’s office told the prison warden to ignore the court’s order. A state court overseeing the case scolded Bailey’s office in a hearing, saying, “I would suggest you never do that.”
Legal experts and other observers of the office said state attorneys general traditionally didn’t act primarily as partisan warriors. Most were focused on defending the state in court and protecting consumers.
Scott Holste, who served as a spokesperson for Jay Nixon, a moderate Democrat who served as the Missouri attorney general from 1993 to 2009, recalls a starkly different approach from Bailey’s. For example, in late September 2008, the top headlines on Nixon’s website focused on robocall rules, lawsuits over mortgage fraud and consumer tips for students.
“We were stridently apolitical in our news releases and in the way we operated,” Holste said. “Our job was to serve all Missourians, not to make political points.”
In the days before the August 2024 Republican primary, two of the three stories featured on Bailey’s homepage targeted the Biden administration over immigration and protections for LGBTQ+ students. The third highlighted a consumer-fraud prosecution.
To his supporters, Bailey is fulfilling campaign promises — a conservative acting like a conservative, said state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson.
Voters see a leader defending their freedoms by fighting policies such as diversity and equity, which they often equate with racism, and mask mandates, which they view as government overreach, Seitz said. “And,” he added, “we have a populist president who appreciates that.”
Toth, the retired head of the national AGs association, traced the shift in how state attorneys general act to the 1998 multistate settlement with the tobacco industry, when nearly every state joined a landmark deal that required cigarette makers to pay more than $200 billion, curb advertising aimed at children and fund anti-smoking campaigns. It also showed attorneys general how much power they could wield.
Over time, the newfound power has raised the profile of attorney general offices across the country, turning them into a springboard for higher office. That higher profile has fueled politicization.
Democratic attorneys general are no strangers to using their offices to fight political battles. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, for example, has filed numerous lawsuits challenging policies of the Trump administration on immigration, environmental regulations and federal funding. While Bonta maintained these suits were based on the law, critics characterized the coordinated legal action as politically motivated resistance.
Dan Ponder, a political science professor at Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, said that as the state has shifted to the right, the GOP primary, rather than the general election, is now the real contest for statewide office.
He pointed to actions such as Schmitt opposing critical race theory and reviewing public school textbooks. “That would have been unheard of 20 years ago,” Ponder said, “but now you can’t lose because you’re fighting the quote-unquote good fight.”
Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, said that from the time of Bailey’s appointment to the position in January 2023, he probably had only two audiences. The first were voters he needed to defeat Will Scharf, a candidate already in Trump’s orbit, in the 2024 Republican primary for attorney general.
“And then once he secured his election, then I think his audience was really Trump,” Squire said.
Former Missouri Republican Party Chair John Hancock said voters seemed to reward Bailey’s approach. Bailey got nearly as many votes as Trump and Gov. Mike Kehoe in the 2024 general election — and more than Hawley or any of the Republicans who won the offices of lieutenant governor, treasurer or secretary of state.
“So obviously the work he was doing in that office was supported,” Hancock said. “I don’t take terrible shock when politicians do political things.”
Kehoe has appointed Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House speaker and U.S. attorney, to succeed Bailey as attorney general. Hanaway has said she intends to run the office in a different style. She told the Missouri Independent she had more interest in Medicaid fraud, consumer protection and violent crimes.

Students see NSU’s curbing of resources for Hispanic and undocumented students as part of the larger push nationwide to rein in diversity, equity and inclusion programs by the Trump administration. And faculty say attempts to push back against the efforts has led to retaliation by university administrators.
Marcela Rodriguez-Campo, the former director of the university’s Office of Community, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, resigned in August, citing the “discontinuation and erasure” of her department as well as other diversity programs.
“There are folks who had been building at the institution for a decade, who have now been blacklisted, been forced to sign non-disparagement agreements and have essentially had their voices taken from them for advocating for the continuation of these programs and for the needs of students,” she said.
Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the U.S. Department of Education, determined to dismantle any DEI initiatives, has launched investigations into higher education institutions’ diversity related programs.
According to the Chronicle for HigherEducation, Nevada State closed its Office of Community, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion as of May 1, one of 403 college campuses in 47 states and the District of Columbia to do so this year. 
In an email, Maria Marinch-Gibbons, a spokeswoman with Nevada State, said the dismantling of the CEDI office was part of efforts that began in 2022 to reorganize campus priorities and “ensure the institution is prepared for future growth while maintaining flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of students, faculty, and staff.”
A newly formed Student Transition and Retention Office “is designed to play a crucial role in expanding student service, student peer mentoring, and cohort program experiences to all Nevada State students,” Marinch-Gibbons added in the email. 
The Current also emailed NSU seeking additional information, including: how many employees had previously been in the CEDI office or diversity related programs that were transferred to other departments; how many employees were asked to sign agreements prohibiting them from saying anything disparaging about school officials or administrators; and what is NSU’s response to concerns raised by faculty and students who said they face retaliation after speaking up against ending the programs.  
The university declined to answer those questions “due to the connection to personnel matters.” It did verify that “standard employment contracts do not include a non-disclosure agreement.”
Rodriguez-Campo said beyond the CEDI office the university is also ending or dramatically scaling programs such as Nepantla, which helped first generation college students, as well other diversity serving programs.
The cuts of staff and threats to jobs have disproportionately impacted on Latinas, she added.
“It’s been really heartbreaking, because many of us have so much love for Nevada State University,” Rodriguez-Campo said. “We are witnessing it be remade in a way that does not align with the values that the institution has said it believes in.”
One current academic faculty, who has worked for Nevada State for several years, said some faculty members were moved around into different departments but “a lot of people moved to roles they were not suited for.”
The anonymous faculty member said she understood if the institution wanted to protect itself from attacks on diversity and threats from the Trump administration but that the school’s leadership “didn’t have to go all in.”
“There is a sense we got from the (Nevada State) administration that people should be grateful,” she said. “In practice, people weren’t being treated like they were colleagues in this process.”
The attacks by the Trump administration on any sort of diversity or equity program has led many universities to lose federal funding. The administration announced this month it would withhold $350 million of congressionally approved funds to minority-serving colleges and universities and divert the funds elsewhere.
Broadly speaking, even conversations at Board of Regent meetings “where institutional leaders were direct and outspoken on what we value,” has shifted to a more cautious tone, said Molly Appel, a member of the Nevada Faculty Alliance and a professor at Nevada State.
The shift in tone isn’t unique to Nevada institutions, she said. 
“What we’re seeing is higher education being more focused on maintaining its existence than focusing on its reason for existence,” Appel said. 
But the example has been more apparent at Nevada State.
“I don’t envy the position our administrators are in right now,” Appel said. “They are dealing with a lot of shifting ground constantly. I think they do want to be protecting us ultimately. But I see the impact of the choices they are making.”
She couldn’t speak directly about how other universities like UNLV and UNR are responding to anti-diversity backlash. 
“I think Nevada State has really gone from being unapologetic about embracing and celebrating students’ diverse, racial, cultural and ethnic identities to tiptoeing around it,” Appel said. “What hasn’t changed is the dedication to first generation students and non-traditional students. That is still very much present in our mission. But the way we talk about (our mission) certainly has changed and there is a feeling of whiplash in many ways.”  
In a statement to the Current, UNR said it was committed to “fostering an inclusive, equitable, and diverse learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff” adding that the university is reviewing “policies and programs to ensure compliance with applicable laws while preserving the goals of access, opportunity, and support for students.”
UNLV didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
‘Character assassination campaign’
Nevada State University announced in a social media post in August that the CEDI office and its social media would become inactive. 
The university had been building a pathway toward dismantling all diversity programs since fall of 2024, Rodriguez-Campo said.
Faculty and staff leading various diversity programs were brought in last year to talk about the direction of those programs. 
“We believe that those conversations were intended for us to be able to provide feedback and play an active role in figuring out how we are going to protect our students at our institution and the work that we did,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
That wasn’t the case, she added. 
Instead of listening to those leading diversity programs, the administration focused on “reorganization” and began to “strip historic programs that had existed at our institution of their funding, of their staffing, of their spaces, of their resources,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
An email obtained by the Current that was sent in March this year by Leilani Carreno, the former Nepantla Director, showed when community members and Nepantla alumni were first informed the program would be “discontinued.” 
“We have built a community where first-generation students have found support, guidance, belonging, and together we have seen generations of students succeed and thrive in their academic journeys,” the email read. “I know this news may feel unsettling, and I want to assure you that we are fully committed to providing support to all current participants during this transition.”
Faculty who ran diversity programs began to voice frustration with the administration about the abrupt changes.
Those faculty were often met with a “character assassination campaign” from high level administration, Rodriguez-Campo said.
In one case, the university took away a staff member’s private office, put her in a cubicle to be supervised, and then barred her from being able to speak directly with students, she added. 
“The surveillance she was experiencing was really intense,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
“Any meeting that she had, she had to report back to her supervisor what those meetings were about and why.”
Appel believes the university, and its faculty, are still committed to serving nontraditional students core to Nevada State’s mission. 
But she acknowledged there have been departing faculty who told her they left because the “institution no longer aligned with their values or they pushed back against this change.”
In addition to attacks against diversity related programs in higher education, the second Trump term has included a relentless mass deportation campaign targeting undocumented people and reversing immigration policies, such as temporary protected status, for previously protected groups. 
Many of the students who benefited from diversity related initiatives also are affected by the shifts in immigration policies. 
“They need these supports more than ever,” Appel said. “They need a sense of affirmation. In some ways, they see their institutions tiptoeing around it and hiding.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nVStateuniversityphoto-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

SB 20 is the most recent legislation filed by members of the Alabama Republican Conference that expands either the protection or authority of law enforcement.
Among bills filed on those lines for the 2026 session are proposals that make it a crime to refuse to provide law enforcement with information and require incarceration for a person caught attempting to evade law enforcement.
Some of the bills are ones that the Legislature failed to enact into law during the previous sessions in the quadrennium.
In the spring, legislators enacted a law that established enhanced immunity protections for law enforcement against criminal charges or civil lawsuits for alleged wrongdoing while performing their duties.
A message was sent to the Southern Poverty Law Center Wednesday seeking comment.
SB 20 leaves much of the current law intact, which already allows people to be charged with harsher penalties for those who cause “serious” physical injury to others or injure others using a “deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.”
Under the bill, people could be charged with second-degree assault when they “cause physical injury to a current or former local, state, or federal public official during or as a result of the performance of the current or former official’s duty, he or she causes physical injury to any individual.”

(Lithium Americas video screengrab)The Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates the company’s $2.26 billion federal loan for the Thacker Pass mine project in Nevada.
Reuters reported on Tuesday the White House is requesting as much as a 10% stake in the Canada-based mining company in exchange for a modification to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan. 
Thacker Pass, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border, is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America once operational. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors.
Lithium Americas confirmed on Wednesday it was in discussions with the DOE and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan, adding the company is working towards “a mutually agreeable resolution.”
Tim Crowley, vice president of government and external affairs for Lithium Americas, said in an email Wednesday that the company cannot comment on the details of its discussions with the DOE and General Motors, but expects “to provide an update in the future.”
The negotiations revolved around a modification sought by Lithium Americas and General Motors that would allow a longer repayment period for the loan after Lithium Americas missed conditions necessary for the first disbursement.
“In exchange for their minor modification, our minor modification was essentially for the administration to have some equity in the deal to create a cash buffer and eliminate some risk for taxpayers … we want some equity on behalf of taxpayers,” a White House official told Axios.
While Lithium Americas has offered to provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for the loan, General Motors is proving to be a tougher sell, according to Reuters.  
General Motors invested $650 million in the mine, securing a 38% stake in the project. Under the agreement, the car company has the right to buy during the first stage of lithium production — but not an obligation to do so — which became a sticking point for the White House.
According to the Reuters report, the White House is now asking General Motors to commit to purchasing the mine’s lithium. The report said Trump officials are also asking General Motors to give up control over some parts of the project. 
The White House said the request for an equity position was driven by concerns Lithium Americas would struggle to repay the loan given low lithium carbonate prices created by softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.
The price of lithium carbonate has fallen more than 80% since its peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said the price fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts do not expect lithium prices to rally significantly any time soon.
The Trump administration’s interest in an equity position with Lithium Americas seemed to be well received by investors. Lithium Americas’ stock price more than doubled at one point following the reports of the U.S. stake.
The move is the latest example of the Trump administration seeking direct government ownership in Nevada’s critical minerals industry as the administration looks to strengthen its position in both domestic production and global supply chains.
The Department of Defense took a 15% equity stake in Las Vegas-based rare earth miner MP Materials in July, making the federal government the largest shareholder in the company. 
Nevada officials have said they expect more investment from the federal government in the state’s mineral supply chain, especially from the DOE and the Department of Defense.
“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a lithium summit last week.
“I think you’ll see that in Nevada,” Burns said.
The Trump administration has sought a government stake in other critical mineral and semiconductor companies. In June, the Trump administration approved US Steel’s takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel in exchange for the federal government owning a majority control of the company’s shares. 
Last month, the federal government also announced it would take a 10% stake in Intel in an effort to help boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. The federal government also said it would allow Nvidia and AMD to sell their chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenues on those sales.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumcarbonatecropped-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-09-25 07:56:36.030861

“Under my leadership,” Trump gushed, “grocery prices are down,” and “growth is surging.”
“This,” Trump proclaimed, “is indeed the golden age of America”
Cool.
Let’s see him say that in Las Vegas.
Trump was inaugurated in January. Passenger traffic at Harry Reid International Airport has declined every month since then, for seven consecutive months. 
Barring a miracle, passenger traffic at the airport will be lower this year than it was the year before for the first time since the pandemic. The last time before that was the depths of the Great Recession a decade earlier.
For the sixth time in the first eight months of 2025, Nevada lost jobs again in August. Whatever job growth had occurred since the previous August had been washed away by job losses; the size of the workforce was the same last month as it was in August 2024. 
In other words, as of August, job growth in Nevada was effectively nonexistent.
Construction was the sector that lost the most jobs and drove overall job shrinkage in Nevada in August. “Mortgage rates are down” is another boast Trump made to the UN. But they’re not down enough to overcome a plunge in area home sales contributing to falling construction employment. 
Trump’s tariffs are also causing “extreme” cost increases for construction materials, and Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics are shrinking the supply of available workers, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.
During Republican Joe Lombardo’s first year as governor, the political action committee which exists to shore up his political career routinely issued statements saying things like “Nevada has experienced 10 straight months of employment growth under Governor Joe Lombardo’s leadership.” 
When the PAC issued that particular version of the statement, in October 2023, it was also true that Nevada had experienced 34 straight months of employment growth under President Joe Biden’s leadership. Though of course the PAC didn’t say that part. 
Biden’s gone, Lombardo’s not, and to reiterate, under Trump’s leadership, and Lombardo’s, Nevada has experienced employment decline in six of the last eight months.
And no, grocery prices aren’t down
Food was 3.2% more expensive in August than it was a year ago, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Summary released earlier this month. 
That’s the highest inflation rate for food since October 2023. The inflation rate for food in August was also higher than the overall inflation rate for all goods and services, which was 2.9%.
To be fair, the inflation rate for what the BLS calls “food at home” — groceries — was slightly lower than the overall inflation rate, at 2.7%. 
But that doesn’t mean “grocery prices are down,” as Trump asserted. It means that — “under my leadership,” as Trump put it — groceries are on average nearly 3% more expensive than they were a year ago.
Meanwhile, the cost of “food away from home” was 3.9% more expensive than it was a year ago. And the cost of eating out at “full-service” restaurants (as opposed to “limited-service” ) was 4.6% higher last month than in August 2024.
So don’t eat out. Right?
Except that would make things worse.
“Accommodation and food services” is by far Nevada’s largest employment sector, accounting for more than 20% of the state’s jobs. 
At a minimum, more than 42% of the people holding those jobs are directly employed in full-service or limited-service restaurants, and not just those tasked with the care and feeding of tourists. In a metro area of 2.4 million people, it’s safe to assume those 2.4 million residents, not tourists, are the largest Southern Nevada customer base for food away from home on any given day.
As Las Vegas slips into whatever economic fate awaits it, the last thing it needs is the effects of slumping tourism and construction to be compounded by weakness in spending by locals brought on by food inflation, in turn jeopardizing food service jobs throughout the valley. But that might be what Las Vegas gets.
Donald Trump, come on down…
Albeit unintentionally, Trump has persuaded most of the world’s nations they need to put as much distance between them and dependence on the U.S. economy as possible, because U.S. policy under Trump’s leadership is a noxious brew of instability, arbitrariness, and fanaticism.
And having accomplished that task in a relatively short span of time, Trump has declared victory and moved on from economic policy — he never brags about his big beautiful bill anymore. Instead he’s focused on what he sees as more personally gratifying pursuits, like imposing a militarized police state in U.S. cities, silencing and/or punishing any and all who fail to hail his magnificence, and making Charlie Kirk’s birthday a national holiday. 
So even though there’s a tall building with his name on it in Las Vegas, Trump’s current awareness of Nevada’s economy may extend no further than tearing up already-approved federal loan conditions so as to snag his regime direct ownership interest in a lithium mine.
He should come to Las Vegas and make the same boasts about his economy that he made to the UN. 
No, it won’t cause him to reverse policies. Make no mistake, for the foreseeable future, Las Vegas is on its own. 
But it would be instructive to see if he can make people believe the bilge coming out of his mouth instead of what they see with their own eyes, and convince them the Las Vegas economy is great. After all, there’s no (well, less) tax on (some) tips (temporarily), so it must be, right?

The fight over health care for trans youth has come to New Jersey, with parents saying medical providers are denying needed care to their children. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Parents of children who receive gender-affirming care in New Jersey are urging the state attorney general to protect access to those services, as medical providers increasingly yield to the Trump administration’s pressure to cut such care for people under 19.
It’s unclear how many medical providers are taking this route. RWJBarnabas Health, the largest academic health care system in New Jersey with 15 children’s hospitals statewide, told the New Jersey Monitor that it recently stopped accepting new pediatric patients for gender-affirming care.
And in a letter earlier this month, seven parents told Attorney General Matt Platkin that Atlantic Health providers have alerted patients and their guardians that the system also might end or scale back gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s January executive order that threatened funding cuts for noncompliance.
Jane Buchanan of Maplewood said she signed the letter because the gender-affirming care her son, now 18, received at Atlantic Health over the past four years helped him overcome “very serious mental health issues.”
“Once he started receiving very supportive, very professional care, it just really helped him be a healthy, happy kid and get through high school,” Buchanan said. “This care is utterly crucial for our kids. The idea of it disappearing is terrifying.”
Gender-affirming care for youth typically involves mental health counseling and medications like puberty blockers and hormone therapy. It can include surgery, but a 2023 study found surgical intervention is rare for transgender youth.
Atlantic Health did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment. Buchanan said the health care system, which oversees seven hospitals, also has not responded to a letter demanding answers that she and more than 500 other parents and advocates signed and sent earlier this month to Saad Ehtisham, who became Atlantic Health’s president and CEO in July.
Platkin’s office declined to answer questions and referred the New Jersey Monitor to a joint statement he and 14 other state attorneys general issued in February that says: “No federal law makes gender-affirming care unlawful. President Trump cannot change that by Executive Order.”
Since January, hospitals around the country have paused or ended such care, with 27 states enacting laws that limit gender-affirming treatment for minors. A judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order in response to lawsuits filed by both LGBTQ advocates and a coalition of states, including New Jersey.

In New Jersey, RWJBarnabas Health officials decided to limit gender-affirming care to patients age 19 and older, although current pediatric patients receiving hormone therapy or blockers may continue to do so “pending further updates from the federal government,” spokeswoman Carrie Cristello said.
“After careful consideration of the current federal landscape, including executive orders, administrative and enforcement actions, and U.S. Supreme Court rulings, and in alignment with other academic health systems across the country, we recently made the decision to update our gender-affirming care policy,” Cristello said. “Our physicians and care teams are working directly with patients and their families to provide resources and support as needed.”
In July, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice sent more than 20 subpoenas to pediatric providers of gender-affirming care, vowing to hold accountable “medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology.”
Bondi did not specify which providers, and Cristello declined to say whether RWJBarnabas Health received a subpoena. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, whose Gender and Sexuality Development Clinic is a go-to provider for many New Jersey transgender youth, was among those subpoenaed.
The uncertainty and cutbacks in care have distressed New Jersey’s transgender community.
Parents are afraid not only that children may not receive needed care, but they also fear a loss of privacy, getting dragged into legal fights between the government and health care providers, and getting prosecuted by — and possibly losing custody to — authorities who regard gender-affirming care as criminal abuse, said Del Sasso, a clinical psychologist in Middlesex County who specializes in such care.
“People in the community are very frightened that they’re compiling lists of trans kids and their families, and trans adults,” Sasso said. “All of my patients who are transgender, or have a transgender family member, have a plan to leave the country. Some of those are emergency plans that they’re hoping not to act on. But they range from that to people who have a plan that they’re leaving ‘in four months to X place.’ And I know many, many, many families who have left.”
Aisling MacDonald of LGBTQ rights group Garden State Equality said health care institutions should not let fear dictate care.
“We understand that health care systems are under immense pressure, navigating unclear federal guidance, media scrutiny, and real fear of political backlash,” MacDonald said. “But let us be clear: evidence-based, lifesaving gender-affirming care for youth remains legal in New Jersey. The long-term financial and ethical complications from ceasing such care far outweigh the short-term benefit of early compliance with federal whims.”
Sasso seconded that sentiment, saying ending this care for transgender youth is “extraordinarily dangerous.”
“This is absolutely deadly for our community. I don’t think that that’s hyperbolic. Perhaps that’s the goal,” Sasso said.
 Calls to codify care

In their February joint statement, the 15 attorneys general pledged to “continue to enforce state laws that provide access to gender-affirming care, in states where such enforcement authority exists.”
That’s not New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2023 that protected access to gender-affirming care and decreed that denial of such care constitutes discrimination, saying denial of gender-affirming care violates the Law Against Discrimination, which bars discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
But New Jersey does not explicitly protect gender-affirming care by law. Several other states do, including Massachusetts, where Gov. Maura Healey last month signed a law shielding parents of transitioning pediatric patients from claims of abuse, neglect, or maltreatment.
Similar legislation that would essentially codify Murphy’s executive order and shield transgender patients and their parents from liability is already in the Statehouse pipeline in Trenton. It has widespread support, with 32 Assembly members and 18 senators — including Senate President Nicholas Scutari — listed as sponsors, but it hasn’t moved since it was introduced in June 2024. Scutari (D-Union) and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment.
Legislators are not expected to return to Trenton until after the general election in November, when all 80 Assembly seats and the governor’s race are on the ballot. Advocates like Louise Walpin have lobbied hard for lawmakers to come back earlier to act on the bill.
Walpin successfully led New Jersey’s fight to legalize same-sex marriage in both the Statehouse and the courts more than a decade ago. She finds legislators’ inaction on the gender-affirming care bill a frustrating missed opportunity, given that the state now has a “blue trifecta” with Democrats in control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers.
“This isn’t business as usual this year. We’re living in a five-alarm fire, and with a five-alarm fire, you don’t wait to call the troops in,” Walpin said. “We should have the most power right now that we could ever have to fight back against the MAGA, Trumpian, authoritarian rule, and we’re not exercising it. We’re failing groups of people who are really most at risk.”
The protections Murphy ordered “could be erased by the next governor,” Walpin added.
“We don’t know who the governor is going to be or what their stance is going to be on it,” Walpin said.
Jack Ciattarelli, who is seeking to become our next governor, said he has concerns about “life-altering surgery” performed on trans minors. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican former assemblyman now running to replace Murphy, told the New Jersey Monitor that he supports parents’ rights to “do whatever they think is in the best interest of their children.”
Yet he said he’s “greatly” concerned about “life-altering surgery performed at a very young age.”
“I think the medical literature is starting to show us that people that may have had those surgeries eight, nine, 10 years ago are now feeling as though they wish they hadn’t,” Ciattarelli said. “I respect parental rights. But I think if the medical literature is showing us that there have not been good outcomes for people that had life-altering surgeries, eight, nine, 10 years ago, that’s something we need to take a look at.”
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Ciattarelli’s Democratic rival, did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment. She has said she supports gender-affirming care but in December voted for a defense bill that bars such care for children of military families.
To Christian Madera of Millburn, politicians who profess to respect parental rights should have no say about the puberty blockers his 10-year-old son recently began taking under Atlantic Health’s care.
“In some states today, I have the right as a parent to withdraw my child out of a school lesson because I disagree with the content, but I don’t have the right to consult with a medical expert and follow protocols that are endorsed and supported by a number of major medical associations,” Madera said.
The American Medical Association, which represents more than 250,000 U.S. doctors, in June 2023 passed a resolution that calls for protection for this type of care.
Madera signed both letters, to Platkin and to Ehtisham. He said he publicly advocates for gender-affirming care because he believes education can help its critics understand “it’s not anything crazy or mentally ill.”
The puberty-blocking treatment his son is on is reversible and buys the family time for the child to decide at an older age if he wants to continue transitioning, Madera said.
“He has been very clear for a long time that he is a boy. He wants to grow up and have a beard and have a wife and be a man,” Madera said. “These are just normal kids who happen to have a brain that doesn’t match their anatomy. And medicine has always been there to help people when their bodies don’t serve them the way they need to, whether they need hormone therapy because they’re in menopause or they need IVF because they can’t conceive a child. There are all sorts of things where medicine intervenes, and this is just another thing.”

Communities in western North Carolina continue the recovery process. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)It’s been one year since Hurricane Helene first hit Western North Carolina on Sept. 27, 2024. With so many recovery needs still yet to be addressed and so little help from the federal government, it’s time for the state legislature to pass a budget that prioritizes people and stops cutting taxes.
Helene caused an immense amount of damage in a mountainous region that is not usually prone to hurricanes and flooding. All told, it’s estimated that the storm caused $60 billion in damage in Western NC, making Helene the costliest storm to ever hit our state.
Over the past year, important strides have been made to repair public roads and infrastructure, restore utilities, and expedite the process of rebuilding homes. Yet even still, as of September 2025, the combined funding for recovery from federal, state, and private sources is only about $15 billion. This means that 75 percent of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene remains unaddressed one year later.
Neither the federal nor state government has taken seriously the recovery needs of Western North Carolinians.
During past major hurricanes in the country, the federal government has typically covered between 40 and 50 percent of the total damage. For the costliest hurricanes like Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), and Maria (2017), the federal government has covered about 75 percent of the billions in damage. In contrast, to date, the federal government has covered about 9 percent of the total damage caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.
On Sept. 15, 2025, Governor Stein issued a renewed request of $13.5 billion in federal funding for Helene recovery. If granted, this would make a significant contribution toward addressing the outstanding $45 billion in damage that remains unaddressed. However, even in the optimistic scenario where Governor Stein’s request for the $13.5 billion in new appropriations is granted in full, we’re still left with over $31 billion in outstanding damages — about half of all the damage.
With so much damage that still needs to be addressed and the expectation that these sorts of extreme climate disasters will continue, one would figure that state lawmakers would be getting serious about ensuring that we have the funding that we need to recover fully from Hurricane Helene and prepare for the next major disaster. It’s all the more so critical in light of the actions being taken by the current federal administration, including sweeping staffing cuts at FEMA, cuts to essential FEMA programs, and the push to increase the responsibility of states in responding to climate disasters.
Instead, our state budget writers are pushing ahead with unpopular tax cuts for profitable corporations and the ultra-wealthy that will cost our state billions in revenue that is urgently needed to respond to community needs. When fully phased in, for example, the Senate’s proposed tax cuts would mean over $10 billion per year in lost revenue compared to today’s tax rates. Meanwhile, the House and Senate’s continued commitment to eliminating the corporate income tax will enrich out-of-state corporate executives and shareholders while doing nothing to help everyday North Carolinians like you and me.
This is money that could be used to address the many outstanding needs in Western North Carolina. Rather than giving handouts to those who don’t need them, we could instead:

Address Unmet Housing Needs: Provide housing stabilization services to those who are unhoused and rental and mortgage assistance to the hundreds of thousands of disaster survivors struggling to cover the cost of housing and are now facing the prospect of eviction, foreclosure, or displacement.
Support Small Businesses: Provide grants or forgivable loans for small businesses who lost the entirety of their revenue during the peak 2024 tourism season and who are still facing steep losses due to the lack of demand created by the storm. The insufficient direct support for small businesses in Western NC is exacerbating the difficulty of local economic recovery, impacting business owners, employees, and local governments alike.
Support Struggling Workers: Provide workers who have had their hours reduced or lost their jobs with employment opportunities funded by the state that contribute to the recovery effort.
Support Local Governments: Provide local governments with the funding that they need to restore the public infrastructure in their communities so that they don’t have to take our costly loans.
Invest in Resilient Infrastructure: Prioritize resilience in the rebuilding effort so that we build back better in face of future storms.

Of course, there is also no shortage of other, non-disaster related needs that we need tax revenue to address, like ensuring that all North Carolinas have quality health care, that families have access to child care, and that everyone in the state has food on their table.
State budget writers need to wake up to the reality that now is not the time to cut taxes. The people of North Carolina know this, but our elected representatives seem to have missed the memo.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Medicare enrollees in Washington may soon need to get additional approval before undergoing some medical procedures, under a controversial new program the federal government will test in a half-dozen states. 
The 6-year pilot program begins Jan. 1 in Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington, and will rely on artificial intelligence to help decide whether certain care is eligible for coverage. 
It’ll be voluntary for doctors to participate, but critics still see the initiative as a sign of the Trump administration creeping toward Medicare privatization and are unsettled by the use of AI.
“This just is unfortunate and surprising news,” said Dr. Matt Hollon, of the Washington State Medical Association. “Patients expect their care to be guided by doctors, not insurance companies or automated systems.”
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says the goal is to root out fraud, waste and abuse with Medicare, the federal program that provides health coverage to people older than 65 and younger people with disabilities.
Patient advocates, doctors, hospitals and lawmakers in Washington state argue that current forms of the process, known as prior authorization, have been frustrating and resulted in barriers to care. 
And they say they’ve gotten few details from the feds on the rapid rollout. 
For one, it’s unclear why Washington was picked. 
A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson said the state’s inclusion is reflective of the agency’s “goal of testing across diverse practice environments to ensure a reliable and valid model test.” Washington has about 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, about half of whom are enrolled in traditional Medicare and the other half in Medicare Advantage, according to the state.
The new model, known as Wasteful and Inappropriate Services Reduction, or WISeR, will work with third-party companies deploying artificial intelligence to decide if traditional Medicare enrollees qualify for certain outpatient procedures. Health care professionals will have to review any denials the AI technology makes. 
Procedures covered are those the federal government sees as too costly for the resulting medical benefit, or lack thereof. They include skin and tissue substitutes, impotence treatment, deep brain stimulation, cervical fusion, and knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis, among others. Spending on expensive skin substitutes, for example, has surged in recent years even as their clinical value is questioned.
The CMS spokesperson said the objective “is to help patients avoid unnecessary, inappropriate procedures across a narrow set of services.” But critics worry this opens the door to expanding the practice to other procedures, possibly during the six-year pilot. They also contend it could be a step toward privatization. 
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called it a “backdoor move by Republicans to privatize Medicare and let AI decide who deserves health care.”
“I will be opposing it every way I can in the Senate,” Murray said in a statement. 
The third-party companies involved will be compensated with a share of the savings they generate, stoking fears the decision-makers will be incentivized to deny approval.
“The use of AI is looking at this sort of aggregation of data, right? That doesn’t apply to individual patients and may not recognize an individual circumstance, and then they get paid to deny care,” said Hollon, a physician in Spokane. “It’s antithetical to health care.”
The CMS spokesperson said companies will face penalties for wrongful denials and slow decisions. 
Doctors will volunteer to submit prior authorization requests. If they don’t, their insurance claims will be subject to the traditional pre-payment review. The incentive for physicians is knowing that their care will be compensated upfront, instead of learning after the fact that it’s not covered. 
Jeb Shepard, policy director for the medical association, sees this as the “first foray” into prior authorization for traditional Medicare, and it may not always be voluntary.
How it has worked previously
Medicare Advantage, which includes Medicare-approved plans from private insurers, already deploys prior authorization, as opposed to traditional Medicare, where it has rarely been required. 
Most denials for prior approval made under Medicare Advantage are overturned upon appeal. But some patients don’t even know they can appeal, and abandon the care. 
Scrutiny over prior authorization increased after the killing last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, whose company contributed to a surge in Medicare Advantage denials. 
The companies participating in the new process will likely overlap with those already involved in Medicare Advantage’s unpopular review system.

Just days before announcing the WISeR model in June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz touted a pledge from industry leaders to streamline and reduce prior authorization in Medicare Advantage. Insurers said at the time they hoped to decide 80% of requests within moments by 2027, erasing the delays that have frustrated patients and doctors.
“Hospitals do not oppose the idea of making sure that the care that’s provided is care that is needed,” said Taya Briley, general legal counsel at the Washington State Hospital Association. “What hospitals do get concerned about is cumbersome processes that essentially just slow the system down, make it so that it’s hard for patients to get the care they need, make it hard for hospitals to get paid.”
Dr. Bindu Nayak, an endocrinologist at Confluence Health in Wenatchee, said “prior authorization is part of every physician’s daily work, and it adds a lot of time.” This is time that could instead be spent working directly with patients, she added.
Meanwhile, the Statewide Health Insurance Benefits Advisors program manager at Washington’s Office of the Insurance Commissioner thinks WISeR could be a “net positive.”
“We’ll have a more definitive yes or no (if) Medicare is going to pay for it faster if the pilot works the way that it’s supposed to,” said the program manager, Tim Smolen. “So there should be fewer surprises for providers and for beneficiaries.”
Looking for answers
Last month, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, led a letter with more than a dozen of her colleagues asking Oz myriad questions about the pilot. Washington Reps. Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, and Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, also signed on.
As of Monday, Oz hadn’t responded. 
“This should be a bipartisan issue. The states are across the country,” DelBene said in an interview. “There should be concern about making sure that people have access to care in all these states and understand exactly how the models work, why it’s set up this way, what their goals are.”
An AARP spokesperson said the organization is “watching carefully” the implementation of WISeR.
“We are deeply concerned about persistent reports of fraud and abuse of Medicare that are draining the system of much-needed resources,” the spokesperson said in an email. “At the same time, the health care of older Americans must always come first, and nobody should be denied legitimate treatments they need.”
This year, Washington state lawmakers considered legislation adding oversight to the use of prior authorization and limiting the role of artificial intelligence. The measure didn’t make much progress in the Legislature, but will come back in 2026.
And at the federal level, DelBene has pushed a bipartisan bill to speed up the existing prior authorization process for Medicare Advantage enrollees and add guardrails to it.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/droz-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 07:56:36.030861

Mike Braun's office. There were no criminal findings.","Gov. Mike Braun mingles before an Indiana Economic Development Corp. board meeting on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. The board voted to release the results of a forensic audit once a legal review is completed. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Economic Development Corp. will release the results of a forensic examination into the agency and its partners once a legal review for redactions is completed late next week. There are no criminal findings, per Gov. Mike Braun’s office.
Braun led the IEDC board of directors in a unanimous approval of the report’s release during a quarterly meeting Wednesday, at the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis.
“As you’ll see once it’s released, the audit into past IEDC operations prior to this administration confirmed the need for increased transparency and accountability for Hoosier taxpayer money is spent,” Braun told attendees.
He promised an “audit” in April, after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing and more among IEDC and its partners. In May, Washington D.C.-based FTI Consulting began work. The contract is worth up to $800,000 and extended for a year.
FTI Consulting’s proposal identified five “Entities of Interest”: the IEDC; the agency’s nonprofit subsidiary; Elevate Ventures; Applied Research Institute; and IIP, LLC.
“My focus is on solutions, and we’re fixing these issues to get better results for Hoosiers,” Braun said Wednesday. “… We have (been) and will be implementing new internal policies and controls to ensure full transparency.”
Changes include, according to a news release:

All votes must be taken by the IEDC’s full board of directors instead of in small committees.
The agency’s nonprofit arm — the Indiana Economic Development Foundation — will “wind down.” The shadowy foundation was placed on a spending freeze in April. It was created to raise private funds in support of the IEDC’s mission, but often declined to provide information on its donors and expenses. Also in April, Braun forced the foundation to release six years worth of audited financial reports required by the State Budget Committee.
Investment activity must “sta(y) in Indiana.”

IEDC’s board voted to allow Elevate Ventures to resume investment operations with the capital already loaned to the funds it manages on Indiana’s behalf. Those accounts include the Indiana Angel Network Fund and the Pre-Seed Fund.
The approval is “contingent upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the IEDC staff,” said Richard Waterfield, an IEDC board member and leader of various financial management companies.
Similar terms apply to a loan of up to $5 million, also approved Wednesday, to Elevate Ventures’ angel investment program. The State Budget Agency must also give approval, Waterfield said.
Just last month, however, the IEDC deemed Elevate Ventures “in breach of” lending language in all of its active loan agreements after defaulting on the angel investment program. The agency gave the troubled company 30 days to cure the breaches before it neared default on those agreements.
“Future iterations of contracts with partners such as Elevate Ventures and ARI will reflect these new policies and oversight controls to ensure full transparency and maximum value for taxpayer dollars,” the news release read. Braun’s office will also get an appointment to Elevate Ventures’ board.
“Indiana is a great place to do business, and with these additional accountability and transparency measures in place, it will be even a stronger place to live, work and raise a family,” Braun said.

Braun was scheduled to answer reporter questions after the meeting, but reversed course. Instead, he had to attend another meeting, according to his office.
Earlier in the day the Indianapolis Star posted a story detailing  how entities controlled by three men benefited handsomely from taxpayer-funded grants and no-bid professional services contracts: The IEDC under former Gov. Eric Holcomb doled out more than $180 million over less than six years in awards to entities controlled, either in whole or in part, by at least one — and sometimes all — of the three men.
One of those entities was Applied Research Institute, which is included in the audit findings.
Commerce Secretary David Adams additionally fleshed out a new vision for the IEDC.
“Our mission remains unchanged … but our approach is new,” he said. “(It’s going) from state-led to region-led, from fragmented with these various agencies to a unified commerce vertical, and moving from being transactional to transformational.”
Adams emphasized the importance of nurturing the state’s existing workforce — highlighting the administration’s modified employer reimbursement program — to boost productivity and wages. Another focus was homegrown entrepreneurship, in addition to the traditional wooing of big firms.
Under Braun’s administration, the average cost per incentivized job has decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job, according to the news release.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Entergy Mississippi announces largest grid upgrade in history,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/25/entergy-mississippi-announces-largest-grid-upgrade-in-history/,Entergy Mississippi's plan to invest $300 million to upgrade its power grid is designed to reduce outages.,"Entergy Mississippi announced plans Wednesday afternoon to invest $300 million into upgrading its power grid over the next five years. 
Speaking on a stage outside the company’s facility near Lake Hico in Jackson, Entergy President and CEO Haley Fisackerly explained that the investment, dubbed Superpower Mississippi, would mark a 50% increase in its usual power grid spending. The goal, he said, is to reduce outages by half over the next five years by installing stronger poles, increasing maintenance of rights-of-way, as well as installing smart devices and real-time monitoring systems.
The spending still needs Mississippi Public Service Commission approval, but two of the three PSC commissioners were on site for the announcement. Fisackerly, though, said the investment would have no impact on customers’ bills because of revenue increases coming new business from Amazon and other industries.
The CEO echoed past statements that new industries, including energy-intensive data centers, would not lead to rate increases for residential customers. Earlier this month, Fisackerly told Mississippi Today that two new data centers coming into its service area — one in Madison County owned by Amazon and another in Rankin County owned by AVAIO — would provide enough revenue to the utility that rates would actually go up less than they would have otherwise.

Fisackerly declined to say how much Entergy’s revenue had increased from its new industrial customers. 
“The fact that we can pay for an additional $300 million effort without increasing rates gives you an idea about the magnitude of that,” he said. “Think of it this way: We have a cost of business, and when you bring a larger user of electricity, we can spread that cost over a greater base. So they help reduce the cost to the other customers.”
 De’Keither Stamps and Wayne Carr — the Central and Southern District PSC commissioners, respectively, — spoke at Wednesday’s announcement in support of the project.
“It’s a step forward in getting to where we want to go,” Stamps said, emphasizing the importance of keeping rates affordable in areas with high poverty. 
Entergy is the state’s largest utility company, serving about 459,000 customers in 45 counties.  
At the PSC’s September docket meeting, Stamps called for an investigation into the company after hearing complaints from Entergy customers over power outages. 
“We’re not going to stop anything until the reality of the citizens changes,” Stamps said. “They must not have to live in fear when the rain picks up, and they shouldn’t have to live in fear that their water’s going to go out because the water in rural Hinds County (comes from) ground pumps.”

Fisackerly said the company continues to hold town halls to hear customers’ complaints.
According to an Entergy press release, the number of outages caused by fallen trees has spiked in 2025 because of dead vegetation after the 2023 drought, as well as recent storms and tornados. The release clarified that many of those trees are outside the areas the company can trim.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24163328/Entergy-presser-2.jpg,,,2025-09-25 07:56:36.030861

(Kevin Winter/Getty Images)Sometimes one event brings clarity to other, more ambiguous, actions. ABC’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel is such an event.
By threatening ABC over a comedian’s on-air comments, Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr violated core First Amendment limits on the government. And this event is simply the latest example of a playbook that has already been weaponized against law firms and universities.
The offending key line from Kimmel?
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”
Whether that’s true or false, it’s speech.
When it comes to speech, the government’s legitimate responses are limited. It can argue, persuade and even criticize. But it can’t use official power — licenses, funding, investigations — to intimidate people or businesses into silencing views the government dislikes.
Two days after Kimmel’s show, Carr said on a conservative podcast that Kimmel’s remarks had been part of a “concerted effort to lie to the American people.” And, he said, the FCC is “going to have remedies that we can look at.”
He encouraged local stations — themselves FCC-licensed — to push back. And he left no doubt that he wanted action taken against Kimmel: “Frankly, when you see stuff like this — I mean, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Within hours, Nexstar, an owner of ABC affiliates with a $6.2 billion acquisition pending government review, pulled Kimmel’s show “for the foreseeable future.” And hours after that, ABC announced it was indefinitely suspending Kimmel’s show.
While ABC changed course within days, that doesn’t affect how we judge government conduct. Nor does Carr’s later denial that he meant to threaten anyone’s license; what’s important is how a reasonable license recipient would have understood it — and how it reveals the current government playbook.
Carr’s statements crossed a line clearly established by the Supreme Court.
“Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a unanimous 2024 opinion in favor of the National Rifle Association.
It’s one thing for government officials to use persuasion. Persuasion sounds like, “we disagree, and here’s why.”
But when the person who controls your broadcast license enters the fray threatening action because of your speech, it’s not a clash of ideas anymore. It’s the government using leverage to get a result through means that violate the Constitution.
The Kimmel case provides a clear example of conduct that violates the First Amendment. But the government playbook in the Trump administration has consistently emphasized leveraging government benefits and threats to get other actors to do what the administration wants.
Pulling funds and threatening investigations has been brought to bear against universities across the country. Some have taken the government to court, often achieving court rulings that the government had overreached, while others have settled and still others simply worry and keep their heads down as far as possible.
Universities have many roles, but expanding knowledge and testing ideas are core principles — not enforcing the party line, whether it’s left, right or center. But when funding or political threats seek to force schools to change who can study there, what professors can say, or what programs can exist, students and faculty learn the wrong lessons: keep your head down, avoid hard topics and don’t risk speaking out.
That’s not what universities are for. Nor is it what we want from educators who are paid by taxpayers. Educators should be encouraged to share their knowledge and experience, not to hide it.
Similar government leverage has been used against law firms, often because of clients the firms have represented. Some firms have taken the government to the court and, once again, won court rulings. But others settled rather than risk damage to the firm or its clients.
The harm is to the public. Our justice system depends on everyone having a voice.
When government officials threaten investigations or contracts to make firms drop clients or arguments, there’s harm to the public’s right to have disputes decided on the merits. If the government can scare lawyers away from some clients, anyone’s rights could be the next to be in danger.
So where do we go from here? All of us need to remember that the rule of law isn’t just an abstract concept. It’s a promise that the same rule will apply even when emotions run hot or when your views are disfavored by the government. You need not agree with Kimmel, a university president or a law firm’s client list to insist that the government follow the rules.
In fact, that’s when it matters most.

The department administers the state unemployment insurance program. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)A change to unemployment compensation that would penalize people who receive federal disability payments has made it into a draft bill to revise Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance law — despite vocal opposition from Democrats in the state Legislature.
For people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) income, the change would sharply reduce their jobless pay if they lose work. For many, it could wipe out their unemployment compensation entirely, according to Victor Forberger, a veteran unemployment insurance lawyer.
The SSDI provision is part of the agreed-upon draft legislation that was approved Wednesday by the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council.
The council includes an equal number of management and labor representatives and was established in 1932 to give labor and management an equal voice in shaping the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) program. The council’s members negotiate and draft changes to the state’s UI laws every two years.
On Wednesday Forberger called the council’s 2025 draft bill “a terrible deal for workers.”
Less than a week ago, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) walked back an earlier proposal to penalize SSDI recipients who apply for jobless pay. The return of a similar provision in the draft bill caught critics by surprise.
“I was pretty shocked when I heard about it this morning,” said state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a vocal critic of the earlier proposal. “I thought it was put to rest.”
The SSDI unemployment pay ban
Since 2013, under a law enacted in then-Gov. Scott Walker’s first term, people who receive SSDI income are automatically disqualified from collecting unemployment insurance — despite the fact that many SSDI recipients hold part-time jobs and would otherwise qualify for jobless pay if they get laid off.
In July 2024 a federal judge ruled that 2013 law violated two federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The ruling came in a lawsuit that a team of lawyers including Forberger filed on behalf of SSDI recipients who were denied unemployment compensation when they were thrown out of work.
This summer, the judge, William Conley, ordered DWD to stop disqualifying unemployment compensation applications simply because an applicant also receives SSDI.
In August, Conley ordered the department to reconsider the applications of people denied UI because of the ban since 2015 and to award them the jobless pay they would have qualified for without the ban. Conley also ordered DWD to repay applicants who had originally received jobless pay, then had it clawed back after the department belatedly found that they were also SSDI recipients.
Also in August, the joint labor-management advisory committee reviewed a dozen proposed changes in state unemployment insurance law requested by DWD.
One of those proposals was to repeal the 2013 state ban on unemployment pay for people on SSDI. The memo noted the court’s ruling invalidating the ban.
But that proposal also called for offsetting an SSDI recipient’s weekly unemployment pay by the weekly value of the SSDI income. The memo acknowledged that the proposal would probably eliminate unemployment compensation for most SSDI recipients who applied.
“In 2024, the average SSDI payment in Wisconsin was $1,500 per month,” the DWD proposal memo stated. “The average weekly SSDI payment for UI purposes is calculated at $346.20 per week. This weekly amount will in many cases fully reduce the UI benefit a SSDI recipient can receive.”
The memo concluded, “In summary, most SSDI claimants will not be able to receive UI benefits. While some may be able to receive UI benefits, it is expected that the weekly UI payment would be small.”
Offset proposal walked back — then returns
The proposal sparked backlash from Forberger and Democratic lawmakers. On Sept. 18, DWD submitted an amended version of the proposal to the advisory council.
The revision removed the offset provision entirely and called for simply repealing the ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients.
The department noted in its amendment memo that the process of paying past unemployment insurance applicants under the court order had begun, and that those payments were being made without a deduction for SSDI income.
“The Department is amending its proposal to repeal the SSDI disqualification provision and remove the offset provision,” the Sept. 18 memo stated. “This will align with the effect of the court’s order that is now allowing claimants who receive SSDI to be eligible for the full amount of their weekly benefit without a reduction for any SSDI received.”
At the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council’s meeting on Wednesday morning, the body approved a draft bill for updates to Wisconsin’s UI law on a unanimous vote.
The draft includes a repeal of the SSDI unemployment compensation ban. Despite DWD’s Sept. 18 memo, however, the draft includes language that claws back some of an SSDI recipient’s jobless pay.
“If a monthly social security disability insurance payment is issued to a claimant, the department shall reduce benefits otherwise payable to the claimant for a given week by one-half of the amount [of a] security disability insurance payment that is allocated for that week,” the draft bill states.
While the offset in the draft bill is half what the original DWD proposal called for, Forberger said Wednesday that even the 50% offset would likely mean no unemployment pay for many SSDI recipients.
Sinicki and state Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) introduced a bill of their own earlier this month to repeal the ban.
“Receiving SSDI should not prevent working Wisconsinites from receiving unemployment insurance if they’re laid off,” Dassler-Alfheim told the Wisconsin Examiner on Wednesday. “That’s why Rep. Sinicki and I have proposed legislation to remove that ban from state statute, and I’m really hoping that we can see it across the finish line and put this problem to rest once and for all.”
The draft bill is the product of provisions worked out by each caucus — management and labor — in separate closed sessions. The Wisconsin Examiner contacted two senior representatives in the labor caucus of the council for comment Wednesday on the process, but received no response.
“I’m looking forward to finding out how this language got in there,” Sinicki told the Wisconsin Examiner Wednesday afternoon.
“If that language is in there, it is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and you know the courts have already said that. I’ve already said that,” Sinicki said. “And now they’re just going to end up right back in court with this. It makes no sense to me.”
Sinicki has long championed the advisory councils for unemployment insurance as well as for workers comp for negotiating legislation that represents the interests of both labor and management. She’s often chided Republican lawmakers who have authored and passed bills affecting either of those systems without going through the councils.
This time, “I’m struggling with it — I’ll be honest — because it is the agreed-upon bill,” Sinicki said of the unemployment insurance draft. “But first of all, as a Democrat and as somebody who prides herself in the fact that we take care of our most needy, I can’t vote for this.”
Sinicki said the legislation after it’s introduced is subject to being amended like any other bill, and that she would expect an amendment removing the offset proposal.
By tradition, the bill that comes from the advisory council is introduced under the names of the committee chair and the minority party ranking member on the Assembly’s labor committee — which is Sinicki.
Unless the draft is changed, however, “I will not be putting my name on this bill,” she said.

(Getty Images)Members of the General Assembly heard from consultants Wednesday about the potential benefits of setting utility rates over multiple years — rather than approving them annually.
Additional considerations include establishing performance incentives for utilities to accomplish certain goals, such as reliability. 
Nicholas Crowley, the vice president of consulting firm Christensen Associates, said he and his colleagues specialized in performance-based rate making and analyzing regulations across North America. 
 
Read the full report from Christensen Associates here.


Indiana’s current investor-owned utility climate follows a “cost of service” regulation model, Crowley said, meaning that utilities file their total service costs annually and submit that information to commissioners alongside rate requests. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission then decides whether or not to approve the rates requested that utilities say they need to recoup costs from the previous year.
“Economists have long criticized this approach as something that doesn’t provide great cost efficiency incentives,” Crowley said. “It doesn’t provide the utility with an incentive to really cut its costs as much as possible.” 
Rather, when costs for utilities go down, so do their rates. 
“It’s a situation where no good deed goes unpunished,” he summarized. 
But while Crowley had recommendations for improvement, it’s not clear when — or if — the state will adopt them.
Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, said that while he anticipated legislation may be filed, it wasn’t quite “fleshed out” and might be “premature” to consider such a move in the 2026 legislative session. 
“I’m not going to carry the bill,” confirmed Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “Somebody is, but we’re going to crawl before we walk.”
The two lawmakers lead the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications.
 More on recommendations

Performance-incentive mechanisms and forecasted multiyear rate plans differ in their focus, with the former seeking to improve output efficiency — such as capacity or reliability — while the latter looks at input efficiency — such as capital, labor or materials. 
A multiyear plan sets either prices or revenues for three or more years without rate cases. 
“The longer the amount of time the utility has to manage outside of that rate case, the higher the incentive it has to keep its costs low because they want to earn a rate of return. And you can see why there’s risk involved,” Crowley said. 
Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

Though this can take several forms, the one his firm recommended to Indiana was known as forecasted revenue, under which the utility would project its future costs and revenue needs. Though the utility runs the risk of potentially underselling their need, it can provide stable rates for them and for their customers while reducing administrative costs.
Utilities in Indiana can already do this to a more limited extent, known as “forward testing.” Under a multiyear proposal, a “reopener” can be scheduled to renegotiate a rate should a utility’s performance falter.
Performance-incentive mechanisms, on the other hand, allow commissioners to “ding” or reward utilities based on their results. For example, Crowley shared, utilities could be tasked with reducing their average service interruption times and could be fined if they fall below the benchmark.
“Especially in the state of Indiana, where you have all these service quality metrics, you don’t need to overhaul the current regulatory framework — just add a little bit of incentive power to the current framework,” Crowley said. 
But some standards could be “unrealistic,” he warned, such as saying utilities need to average zero minutes of service interruption time.

Seventeen states and Washington, D.C. have some sort of formalized performance-based regulation, Crowley said, with another dozen exploring such methods, including Indiana.
The above options allow for more “incremental change, as opposed to a complete overhaul of the system,” he said. 
Crowley explicitly opted not to include potential tools like price or revenue caps in the options for Indiana, due to the state’s vertically integrated system — which could make such choices expensive. Other places, such as parts of Canada or Massachusetts, have “distribution-only” systems that make such options available.
“We do have caps, but they are not hard caps and they are set by the IURC,” said Soliday. “If you break the cap, then you get additional scrutiny and the IURC can order you to bring them back. Putting a hard cap when you live in an inflationary and changing environment, the issue is: What are you trying to achieve?”
Soliday noted that the state’s aging utility structure makes it difficult for such corporations to adhere to such standards. He also suggested looking at recovery time for utilities after severe weather.
“We’re taking a hard look at the performance-based regulation that we’ve got,” Soliday said. “… And we have to look at it in the long term, not in the short term.”
Luke Wilson, the executive director of the IURC, concluded Crowley’s presentation by saying his body would recommend that the General Assembly “look at enabling the commission to establish performance-based rate-making plans for utilities.”
Doing so would be the next step in bringing the process to Indiana. Wilson also said the commission would recommend, “at least for now,” pausing considerations for multiyear planning.

Byron mother whose February murder-suicide shocked the state was taking ketamine at home against best practices, lawsuit alleges. 
The post Mother of Wyoming woman who killed children and herself sues over ketamine therapy, adding to legislative debate appeared first on WyoFile .","This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
The mother of a Byron woman who killed her four children and then herself has sued a psychiatric clinic in Cody, alleging improper use of ketamine led her daughter to commit a murder-suicide that horrified Wyomingites this past winter. 
The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges that Sage Psychiatry Services allowed Tranyelle Harshman to take ketamine — a powerful anesthetic increasingly used to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder — at her home, against best practices for prescribing the drug.
The lawsuit dovetails with some conservative lawmakers’ growing interest in how psychiatric drugs are used in Wyoming, including more traditional anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications. (Harshman was also taking an anti-anxiety drug at the time of her death, according to the coroner’s toxicology report.) 
Harshman was in treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and postpartum depression, according to the lawsuit. 
After taking ketamine at home this February, the lawsuit alleges, Harshman shot her four children and herself “while in an altered or dissociative mental state.” The suit accuses the clinic of negligently assessing the young mother’s suitability for ketamine treatment and failing to monitor her use of the drug.
Lawmakers on the Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee held a hearing earlier this summer exploring whether psychiatric drugs play a role in Wyoming’s high suicide rate or in acts of extreme violence like Harshman’s murder of her children.

Health department officials, and practitioners, have in turn urged caution about drawing too sweeping a correlation between the use of certain drugs and tragic consequences. 
“This is sad on so many levels, but I don’t want to scare people away from ketamine, ketamine is a great drug,” Tracy Richard, a Cheyenne-based nurse who administers the drug in a clinical setting and opposes nearly all at-home use, told WyoFile. “We don’t know what happened with this person and there’s just so much that goes into this.” 
The attorney representing Harshman’s mother said the way ketamine was administered, and not the drug alone, drove the lawsuit. 
“The purpose isn’t to demonize ketamine,” Sean Olson, the Colorado-based attorney leading the case, told WyoFile in a phone interview Wednesday. “The goal here is to make sure this kind of thing never happens again. Ketamine is a dangerous drug and obviously it’s becoming more common in terms of its medical uses … it’s important to follow the guidelines so that it’s used safely.”
Sage Psychiatry Services did not respond to a voicemail from WyoFile seeking comment Wednesday. 
Ketamine was developed as an anesthetic, and its use as a therapeutic drug is a fairly unregulated area of practice, Shannon Hughes, an instructor at Colorado State University and therapist who advocates for psychedelics and drug policy reform, told WyoFile. There are a variety of ways people can get ketamine for at-home use, Hughes said, including through telehealth programs. But it is very much considered best practice to take it in a clinic and under supervision, she said.  
“These drugs alter your behavior,” Hughes said. “That’s what they do. And that’s why you need close monitoring when you start any kind of medication.” All psychiatric drugs carry risks, Hughes said, and many of those risks include suicidal or violent thoughts.

On the other hand, she said, ketamine leads to lasting improvements for some people who otherwise would be tied to antidepressants indefinitely. Therapists who give ketamine to their clients during sessions can spur lasting breakthroughs in addressing the root causes of someone’s depression, she said. 
“For some people ketamine is a real game changer,” Hughes said. 
There’s also evidence that ketamine can have “a significant therapeutic effect” at depressing suicidal ideation, according to an analysis published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature. 
Medical boards and other regulatory bodies may want to issue more uniform guidelines for the use of ketamine, Hughes said. “Until then, it’s kind of the wild west,” she said. Richard also described ketamine therapy as a “wild west,” and said the increasing ways to get ketamine for home use – a technique she strongly opposed – worried her. But she questioned whether Wyoming lawmakers were well equipped to take on the topic of psychiatric drugs. 
In the weeks immediately after the murder suicide, Harshman’s husband raised his own concerns that his wife’s toxicology report would give the public the wrong impression. “This isn’t a chance to demonize different therapies,” Cliff Harshman told a reporter for Cowboy State Daily, “this works for a lot of different people.”
Rep. Paul Hoeft, a Republican whose Park County district includes Powell and abuts Byron, is bringing a draft bill to the committee’s October meeting that would require the state to better catalogue when suicide victims or perpetrators of severe violent crimes have psychiatric drugs in their systems. 
Though that information is already often collected through coroner’s toxicology reports or law enforcement drug testing a criminal suspect, Hoeft seeks to create a centralized database to track correlations. 
“There’s some concerning associations going on between psychotropic medications and violent outcomes which we’ve seen recently, and which has prompted this lawsuit,” Hoeft told WyoFile. 
To his knowledge, lawmakers aren’t moving to regulate use of psychiatric drugs, Hoeft said, but instead want to gain more information about possible connections to violent deaths. 
Hoeft’s bill came out of the committee’s June meeting in Casper, where lawmakers questioned county coroners and Wyoming Department of Health officials about whether psychiatric drugs were driving suicides or homicides. Two county coroners told the committee they conduct a toxicology report on every death, but that it’s beyond their ability or role to determine whether psychiatric drugs spurred someone to act. 
“Neither one of the medications that she was on ended her life,” Fremont County Coroner Erin Ivie said at that meeting. “And so for our purposes the question is: What is the cause of death? The cause of death is a gunshot wound. What’s the manner of death? Suicide. She did this to herself. What’s the manner for the other people? [Harshman’s four children.] Homicide.”
Wyoming Health Department Director Stefan Johannson cautioned lawmakers seeking to draw correlations from Wyoming’s suicides or homicides alone. Even though the state has a high suicide rate for its population, the overall number of deaths produces a low sample size to look for the correlations described by Hoeft and other lawmakers, Johannson said. 
“I would just caution that drawing lines of causation is very difficult when our numbers in Wyoming … are so low, and you try to draw connections or correlations between chemicals that might have been present,” he said.

Near the farm entrance, circular paths wind around a garden, where benches, flowers and a shaded area have been designed to welcome tribal elders for rest and reflection. 
“This garden is a sanctuary,” Wind River Food Sovereignty Project Co-director Kelly Pingree told a crowd gathered for a grand opening celebration Saturday. “A place for healing, peace and connection with nature.”

Once the ribbon was cut, tribal members and others from the community filed through an ornate gate and into the brand-new elder garden, forming a circle around drummers. After a song and a prayer, it was time to eat. 
Marking the occasion with bowls of buffalo stew and fry bread dipped in chokecherry gravy felt appropriate given that the nonprofit is aimed at restoring food production and traditions in Wind River Reservation communities. 
“As Native people, we always give thanks to Mother Earth for what she provides us,” Pingree told the crowd. “And when we connect with our food, it reconnects us to the land, our ancestral knowledge, our spirituality, our prayer.”
The progress at Trout Creek Farm marks the early stages of a multi-year vision to bolster local production, access to healthy foods, tribal education and more. But it also signifies the fruits of a $36 million federal redevelopment grant that several facets of the reservation stand to benefit from.

The Food Sovereignty project hopes to share with everyone, said Pingree, clad in a vibrant ribbon skirt and standing beneath the flags of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.
“I invite each of you to embrace this garden as your own,” she said. 
A dream takes root
The Wind River Food Sovereignty project was founded in 2018 by Hank Herrera. It was involved with reservation farmers’ markets and initiatives to support native food producers. Herrera passed away in 2020 due to COVID-19 complications, but colleagues continued the work. 
A longtime goal of Herrera’s was to operate a farm that could be both a living classroom and a vehicle to engage tribal members with production of traditional foods and plants. The idea was to find a neutral ground that both tribes could utilize. “We wanted to serve everybody here,” Pingree told WyoFile in a July interview.

The land search took years. But in late 2023, the nonprofit closed on the Trout Creek Farm. The former owner, who was aging, wanted the place to go to someone who would take care of it. The nonprofit vowed to do that. 
Private donations and grants helped enable the Sovereignty Project to purchase the land. In July 2024, it also received a major leg-up as one of the recipients of the federal “Recompete” pilot grant program. Wind River Development Fund, which applied on behalf of the Sovereignty Project and several others on the reservation, was one of only six awardees in the nation. The fund received $36 million, $4.2 million of which was earmarked for the Sovereignty Project’s ambitious plans.
“We knew it would be a huge leap for us, because it’s basically quadrupling our staff over the five years,” Wind River Food Sovereignty Project Co-director Livy Lewis said. “But we felt like we could rise to the occasion.”

The project began by hiring a farm manager and purchasing equipment. Clearing and preparing the land took months. This summer, staff planted seeds in a grow dome, tilled rows for a garden and began a pumpkin patch. They also began expanding work with education initiatives. More recently, they poured concrete and installed pathways to finish the elder garden. 
Saturday’s opening certainly drew elders — but they were joined by families with babies, young adults and residents from nearby towns. Along with feasting, participants drank sweet plum-colored chokecherry tea, perused a table arrayed with traditional native foods like cattails and amaranth, and took in the views of the hulking Wind River mountains to the west.  
First sprouts 
It’s taken years of work to get to the point of harvesting garden crops and opening the elder garden. But for the Sovereignty Project, it’s still just the beginning of a story that will in some ways write itself.  
“It’s the first of its kind,” Pingree said of Trout Creek Farm. “But it’s also to be self determined, to choose our own food ways. You know, that’s what food sovereignty is all about, is to define how we grow our own food, what we choose to eat, and how we distribute that.”

Ultimately, she said, the nonprofit wants to use its grant money to create a healthier community. That means ramping up production enough to get their vegetables and fruits into schools, restaurants and senior homes. Offering plots of dirt for tribal members to grow their own food, and for kids to learn the basics of agriculture and nutrition. Facilitating the expansion of food banks, and hosting cooking and preservation classes. Growing resources to help reverse the habits that have led to high rates of diabetes and obesity among Indigenous people.
“But also teaching them their ancestral ways of being reconnected to the land, which has been severed for many, many years,” Pingree said. “And so to bring that back and to teach them to be proud again of being able to stand up and say, ‘I don’t choose to eat that anymore. This is what I choose to eat.’”

A radioactive nest found at a South Carolina nuclear site gives columnist David Romtvedt pause about nuclear development in Wyoming.
The post Of wasps and men appeared first on WyoFile .","In July, federal officials reported that a radioactive wasp nest was found at the Savannah River nuclear site, an area of slightly more than 300 square miles in the sandhills of South Carolina. Built in the 1950s, the site produced plutonium and tritium to be used in the production of nuclear weapons. In 1996, following the end of the Cold War, the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management began cleanup at Savannah River. This requires dealing with 34.5 million gallons of radioactive liquid waste stored in 43 underground tanks. Other cleanup work includes diluting and disposing of surplus plutonium, and storing or transporting highly enriched uranium as well as both foreign and domestic spent nuclear fuel. Finally, crews will need to dismantle the site and restore the soil and groundwater to a safe condition. The Office of Environmental Management estimates that the process will be complete by 2065, meaning that cleanup will take longer than the site operated.

Opinion

The Savannah River radioactive wasp nest was sprayed to kill the wasps and then bagged as radiological waste. The Department of Energy reported that radioactivity in the nest resulted from the release of past radioactive contaminants, labeling that as “on-site legacy radioactive contamination.” The radioactive nest was not, they said, the result of a leak or loss of contamination control, adding that it posed no health risks.
A few weeks after that first discovery, workers found three more radioactive wasp nests, an indication, according to University of South Carolina biologist Dr. Timothy Mousseau, that there are contaminants in the area that have not been encased and protected. Dr. Mousseau, who studies organisms living in radioactive environments, noted that the government report didn’t indicate the absolute level of radioactivity, the specific isotopes in the nest or the species of wasp that was found, details that would provide clues to the source of contamination. Many wasps, for example, make nests out of wood they have chewed to pulp,which would suggest the presence of radioactive wood nearby. Calling the radioactive wasp nests a red flag, Mousseau said we need to determine if other radioactive material is moving through the ecosystem.
Two things have made the story of the radioactive wasp nests feel personal. One is the introduction during the 2025 Legislature of a bill to allow the manufacture of small nuclear reactors in Wyoming while also opening us to being a disposal site for spent nuclear fuel generated both inside and outside the state. This bill did not become law, but there are several proposals for similar legislation to be introduced during the 2026 session. We need to address not only the risks associated with building nuclear reactors and storing nuclear waste, but also the dangers associated with possibly bringing high-level radioactive spent fuel into Wyoming for reprocessing. 
I don’t see how we can engage in further nuclear development until we can guarantee a way to safely and permanently store spent nuclear materials — radioactive garbage. We don’t currently know how to get rid of this stuff and we know that even the proposed new nuclear reactors will generate radioactive waste that will need to be stored for what, in practical human terms, amounts to just about forever. And while the new reactors are said to be safer than the old, safer does not necessarily mean safe. That’s the reality we face.
This brings me back to the wasps who may be building radioactive homes as a result of chewing up radioactive wood left over from radioactive contaminants released in the past. I often sit on my back porch, where I covered the underside of the metal roof with willow branches — hundreds and hundreds hammered in place with 5 penny finishing nails. The smell of willow fills the porch, especially on hot days. It’s beautiful not only to me but to wasps who build their nests in the cracks and crannies made by the overlapping willow branches. I knock the nests down by hand and sometimes spray them like crazy with water. While I never get rid of the wasps, I keep their numbers low enough that they’re not much of a nuisance. Actually, I like wasps, finding them to be elegant creatures living lives far beyond our own. I hate that at Savannah River, they’re being irradiated by activities associated with the production, storage and disposal of radioactive materials. They are examples of what we often call innocent victims, those we are called upon to protect.

A professor responds to the school president’s message about the killing of Charlie Kirk.
The post An open letter to University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel appeared first on WyoFile .","Dear President Ed Seidel,
I write in response to your university-wide Sept. 10 email on the killing of Charlie Kirk. I do not envy your position stewarding the University of Wyoming through our troubling times. Political violence in our nation is now a frequent occurrence. In recent months, a gunman killed a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota’s Legislature and her husband, two Israeli Embassy employees were gunned down, an arsonist set fire to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home while he and his family slept inside and in Boulder, Colorado, a man set fire to people marching in support of Israel.

Opinion

I have no doubt that your intentions in writing this email were good. You end your email imploring the university to “come together to support and protect our community in the face of such a terrible event.” I worry, though, about the unintentional message of your email that leaves members of our UW community feeling marginalized, unseen.
In “On Rhetoric,” Aristotle identifies a branch of persuasive speech he describes as epideictic rhetoric. This is a social rhetoric that concerns itself with cultural values. We find it in communicative acts that bring communities together under communal bonds. Wedding toasts, obituaries, memorial events such as a 9/11 commemoration, a message from the president after a tragedy, for example, are instances in which we use epideictic rhetoric. Typically, epideictic communication promotes the shared values of a community. Moreover, it reinforces community boundaries. Epideictic rhetoric implicitly makes arguments about who belongs and who does not.
Your email, sent just hours after Mr. Kirk’s assassination, is a form of epideictic rhetoric. It reiterates shared communal values in its condemnation of political violence. It reaffirms commitments to open discourse. I worry, though, about the way your email constructs the UW community and who, based on this email, feels a sense of belonging and safety on campus. The email focuses on the university’s connections to Mr. Kirk. Specifically, you point out that Mr. Kirk recently “spoke on campus to a large crowd” and that he was “invited by UW’s student chapter of Turning Point USA.” You go on to write that “we join many sharing our deepest sympathies to his friends, family, and supporters.” None of that is necessarily objectionable. It’s what’s left out that raises my concerns. Mr. Kirk was a divisive political figure who said and wrote things that many people consider homophobic, racist, antisemitic and misogynistic. Many people across the country felt threatened by Mr. Kirk. Many people at UW did as well.
President Ed Seidel makes his formal recommendation on what to do with the DEI office on May 10, 2024. (Madelyn Beck/WyoFile)
Mr. Kirk occupied a position of tremendous political power that reaches across campuses, that is influential in local and state politics, and that stretches to the White House. When Mr. Kirk spoke, there were consequences. Columnists on the political right and left note that Mr. Kirk was a charismatic visionary. He imagined not just the future of American conservativism, which included and empowered young conservatives, but sought to implement that future through the strong political machinery of TPUSA. What frightens many is the question of who is empowered and included in that future. Or, put more appropriately, who is not included in that future. There are a lot of UW community members who do not see themselves in Mr. Kirk’s vision.
As president of UW, you hold a special responsibility. Your words sent through official channels linked to the office you hold carry consequences. The email explicitly addresses members of our community who have real and felt connections to Mr. Kirk. It invites them into the imagined community of the email. You do not directly address members of our community who find his discourse objectionable or who have fears about the future he worked to create. As such, they are made peripheral in the outlines of the community formed by the epideictic function of your email.
Extreme partisanship and political violence are real problems for our nation. Pundits from across the political spectrum fret over our political divisions and worry if and how it can be repaired. American campuses have long trained students for civic life and democratic engagement. I believe your email is a missed opportunity for bridging divides, for encouraging engagement. We deter further violence and division by starting with our words. I do not make a plea here calling on others for better debate or to honor respectful discourse. These appeals are not enough. We — the administration and faculty — occupy positions of institutional leadership. We must use our advantaged positions to leverage institutional infrastructures and resources that create forums and spaces for engagement in the everyday spaces of campus life, that structurally promote exchange among people, that assemble community. We, as leaders, must create multi-vocal spaces on campus that invite students (and faculty and staff) into discourse about community values and that allows students agency in shaping their community based on our shared values.
In graduate school I was taught that if you don’t like an article someone wrote you should write the article you wish they had written. Here is my attempt:
The assassination of Charlie Kirk is one of many recent acts of political violence in our nation. The increase in political violence is troubling and leaves many of us afraid, distraught and even angry. On our campus, Mr. Kirk had many supporters and many critics. Regardless of our feelings, his death from an act of political violence affects us all. Our local and national communities are harmed by violence. We, each of us, are harmed by this kind of violence. We should use this moment as an opportunity to reflect on our commitments to building an inclusive campus that honors our differences, and which promotes peaceful and curious engagement across those differences.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)WAUSAU — In his first event since launching his campaign for governor of Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany made the case for his governorship and promised the large crowd seated and standing around a barn on Wednesday that he’ll work hard to win in 2026.
The 2026 race will be the first open election for governor of Wisconsin in over 15 years as Gov. Tony Evers decided to retire at the end of his second term. Tiffany became the third Republican candidate in the race on Tuesday. Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien are also running in the Republican primary for the office. The Democratic field is growing with at least six candidates so far. The primary is scheduled for August 2026.  
“We are making America great once again,” Tiffany, who stood in front of an American flag, told the crowd. “Now we need a governor that’s going to lead Wisconsin to prosperity. Are we going to be one of those states that chooses prosperity like Texas and Florida and Tennessee and Ohio or are we going to be one of the laggards like New York or California?”
Tiffany declared during his speech that he is “the leader” in the race as he called for people to join him in his work. 
“I will put every ounce of my energy into this… but I cannot do it alone,” Tiffany said. “I am going to need your help.” 
Berrien, who has never held elected office, criticized Tiffany as a “career politician” in a statement after his launch. 
“We need builders who will create prosperity for all through work, revitalize the manufacturing infrastructure that lies dormant in our state, and jumpstart our economy,” Berrien said. “As the only builder in this race, I’m the strongest general election candidate Democrats will face — and they know it!”
Schoemann, meanwhile, welcomed Tiffany to the race. 
“Looking forward to a Republican primary focused on ideas and winning back the governor’s office,” Schoemann said in a social media post on Tuesday. 
In his 16-minute speech, Tiffany highlighted his childhood on a dairy farm in Elmwood, in the western part of the state as one of eight children.
“Growing up on the farm, we learned to work hard. We learned how to work hard, and we learned to live on a budget, and there are no excuses on the farm, you pick up the shovel, you pick up the pitchfork and you go to work,” Tiffany said. “That’s the way it is. There’s no excuses when those chores start to pile up, and it’s kind of the Wisconsin way.”

The crowd of attendees, some wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, Turning Point USA shirts and even vintage Tiffany for Senate shirts, cheered enthusiastically throughout the speech. 
Linda Michalski, a Wausau resident who retired from working for Marathon County as an  accountant, said she got an invite to Tiffany’s event from the Marathon County Republican Party, of which she is a member. She said she hasn’t researched the other Republican candidates in depth, but that she believes Tiffany’s name recognition will give him an edge.
Michalski said Tiffany’s backstory stuck out to her. 
“Dairy farmers work hard. You can’t just let things slide. You can’t just go on vacation if you’re a dairy farmer, in a dairy farmer family. Things have to get done, and they can’t… If more people had a strong work ethic, they wouldn’t be faced with financial difficulties,” Michalski said. 
Tiffany is hoping to lean on voters like Michaski in the areas of the state where he is most at home, telling reporters after his speech that he needs to “juice up” turnout in northern and western Wisconsin in order to win in 2026. 
“I’m driving all over the state of Wisconsin today, and I was talking to people that were making commitments, and I think you’re going to see more people climb on board here,” Tiffany said. “I got to prove myself to people, the state of Wisconsin.” 
Tiffany, who lives in Minocqua, has represented Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, a massive area encompassing the northern part of the state, in the House of Representatives since 2020. Before he went to Washington D.C., Tiffany served in the Wisconsin Legislature, first in the Assembly for about three years, followed by nearly eight years in the state Senate, where he was a member of  the powerful, budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. 
Tiffany told reporters that he is expecting that he’ll have to raise $30 or $40 million, and that his campaign is “off to a good start.”
Republicans in the gubernatorial primary are anxiously awaiting a possible endorsement from  President Donald Trump. Tiffany said his last conversation with Trump, which centered mostly on the 7th CD, was in August. 
“We will see how he responds. If he chooses to endorse me, I will certainly welcome that endorsement,” Tiffany said. 
In his speech, Tiffany said he would freeze property taxes and said the annual $325 school revenue limit increase that districts receive due to a partial veto by Evers would be “dead on day one.” 
The annual revenue limit increase gives school districts the option to bring in additional revenue, though without additional state aid, their only option to benefit from the increase is to raise local property taxes. Many school districts throughout the state have been leaning on property taxes to help with costs, since state aid to schools has not kept pace with inflation for almost two decades.
Michalski, a homeowner, said that a freeze in property taxes would be a “welcome relief.” She said her own property taxes have jumped nearly $1,000 recently, a hike that she blames on the Wausau Common Council. 
“Our current government is — it’s awful. It’s just awful, what Gov. Evers is doing. He’s pushing away businesses, he’s adding taxes upon taxes, and… he’s imposing a tax on property owners for 400 years,” Michalski said.

Tiffany didn’t have additional specifics when it came to exactly how he would freeze property taxes while talking to reporters after his speech. 
“There’s plenty of money in Madison that I think we can help out those local municipalities to do the property tax freeze taxes at the local level. Where are the schools and the local municipalities going to get their money, right? I think the state can help out, especially after the spending blowout with this budget,” Tiffany told reporters after his speech. 
Asked by a reporter if he would seek a suspension of school referendums, Tiffany said he hasn’t “dug that deep into the details” and would “have to study that a little bit.” 
Kevin Lund, a nurse from Kronenwetter, said he appreciates the “Wisconsin First” message that Tiffany delivered. While he identifies as a libertarian, not a Republican, Lund said he has been following Tiffany since he took over from former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy in 2020. 
“He’s paralleling a lot of the conservative type of sentiments that have been kind of nationwide,” Lund said, adding that he is happy about that. “He’s winning on the 80-20 issues, and as long as he can continue to convey that message throughout the state, I think, he’ll find a lot of success.” 
Those issues, Lund said, include immigration and the economy. 
“When you have money, all of a sudden, everybody’s a little bit happier,” Lund said, adding that young people in particular are dealing with challenges trying to afford a home and are “seeing a stagnation in wage growth.” 
“That’s got to be concerning to the younger generation. I’ve got a daughter that’s young, and… I’m wanting to see young people be able to have the chance to succeed in the state,” Lund said.
Tiffany, speaking about his tenure in Congress, highlighted his visits to the southern border where he said he saw “the damage that was being done to America, where every state had become a border state.” Tiffany, who is a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, has been supportive of Trump’s crackdown on immigration during his second term. 
During his speech, Tiffany repeatedly blamed Democrats for problems in the state and played up cultural issues.
“For too long, Democrats have torn down what has been built up in Wisconsin,” Tiffany said. “If we give them four more years? Buckle up! Buckle up! Because you’ll see illegal aliens having driver’s licenses. You’ll see men playing girls’ sports and cheap foreign labor will replace you.” 
Tiffany also declared that there would be “no sanctuary cities” in Wisconsin under his leadership and called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) “unconstitutional and un-American.” 
“I talk to parents, and they have a simple message in regards to education, they just say, ‘Just educate our kids. Don’t indoctrinate them. Just get them a good education.’” Tiffany said, adding that he would seek to ensure that “dollars for education are going to students, teachers, and communities, not the system.”

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Mayors from cities and towns along the Mississippi River are taking action on natural disaster response. Last week they launched a new initiative to improve immediate disaster relief. They’re also lobbying lawmakers to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a cooperative of more than 100 river communities between Minnesota and Louisiana, held its annual meeting last week in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. The mayoral gathering came on the heels of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and after months of threats from President Donald Trump’s administration to roll back FEMA’s role in natural disaster response.
“Emergencies and crises — they are indeed happening more often,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota. “And so we all need to be prepared.”
This year, the Mississippi River corridor experienced flooding and drought. Severe storms and flooding soaked West Tennessee, particularly communities along the Mississippi River and one of its tributaries, the Obion River. Tornadoes devastated communities in Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee. An EF-3 tornado with wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour swept through Selmer, Tennessee on April 3, leaving 332 structures damaged and five people dead.

Stacey Kinder, the mayor of Cape Girardeau, Missouri — which also saw two tornadoes touch down this year – said her state has suffered.
“Yet, in the face of over $2 billion worth of losses since March, just for Missouri, the future of FEMA and the U.S. disaster mitigation and response apparatus remains in considerable flux,” Kinder said.
Earlier this year, Trump said that FEMA could be phased out in favor of individual states carrying the burden of natural disaster response. Although his administration has reversed course on outright abolishing the agency in recent months, Trump officials are still working on an overhaul. The FEMA Review Council, which was created by an executive order, is supposed to make recommendations to change the agency by mid-November. Meanwhile, an Associated Press analysis found major disaster declarations are taking longer under Trump than historical averages. 
In response to FEMA’s uncertain future, the MRCTI announced a new program to deliver assistance to its members “within 72 hours of a disaster event,” said Kinder. That aid could include food, water, hygiene supplies, and other immediate needs, according to Ethan Forhetz, a spokesperson from Convoy of Hope.
Partnership to focus on immediate needs 3 days post-disaster
MRCTI’s executive director, Colin Wellenkamp, said in surveys mayors have consistently said they need help during the first 36 to 72 hours after a disaster, for which there’s rarely money in their budgets.   
The initiative is being done in partnership with Convoy of Hope, a Missouri-based non-profit. The organization provided food and supplies after the May tornado in St. Louis. It helped respond to more than 50 U.S. disasters in 2024, according to its website.
“By working together before disasters strike, we can reduce response time, position resources where they’re most needed, and make sure families receive help quickly and with dignity,” said Stacy Lamb, the non-profit’s vice president for disaster services. “This partnership isn’t just about responding, but it’s about building resilience.”
MRCTI did not disclose how the partnership will be financed.
The program is available immediately for partnering cities and towns and surrounding communities.
“Convoy is committed to working with any city along the Mississippi River, and beyond, during times of disaster,” Forhetz said.
West Tennessee mayor: ‘We do need it to be as quick as possible.’
Ridgely, Tennessee was one of several Northwest Tennessee towns flooded after torrential downpours in April. Ridgely Mayor Shane Hamilton said his community in Lake County is among the most poverty-stricken in the state. 
Hamilton is one of the Tennessee mayors that make up MRCTI, alongside the mayors of Memphis and Tiptonville. He said the Convoy of Hope partnership will be helpful to meet the immediate needs of vulnerable community members following future disasters. The town is home to many elderly residents and a nursing home.
Ridgely has its own emergency management team that works with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and FEMA after disasters, but the process takes time. For Tennessee counties that suffered damage from storms in early April, federal assistance wasn’t unlocked until President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the event more than two months later.

Hamilton said Ridgely has recovered well and was fortunate that the flooding did not greatly impact residents’ homes. Agricultural fields were soaked, and it took longer to plant crops than usual, he said. But if homes were severely flooded, time would be of the essence.
“(Waiting) does put some displacement on people if we have a disaster,” he said. “We do need it to be as quick as possible, but everybody knows that’s not the case, a lot of times, when you’re dealing with the government.”
Hamilton said he’s not aware at this time of any costs to Ridgely associated with being part of the new initiative.
Working toward improved disaster response in the basin
Melisa Logan, the mayor of Blytheville, Arkansas, said the partnership is designed to “fill the largest gap in U.S. emergency response … capacity.”
The MRCTI is plugging other responsiveness holes, too. At this year’s meeting, mayors announced a new dashboard to more easily monitor water levels in the river and drought, to better predict and communicate the state of the basin. 
In addition, MRCTI announced that it is working with legislators on the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans Act of 2025, also known as the FEMA Act of 2025. The bill would make FEMA report directly to President Trump as an independent agency. The bill’s stated aims are to speed up aid delivery to both states and individuals and reward state preparedness.
MRCTI mayors also want to see a mitigation piece to the bill, including a grant program for projects that address regional disaster vulnerabilities.
“So there’s a lot of moving parts with FEMA right now,” Wellenkamp said. “Where all those moving parts are going to land? Don’t know, but as the mayors pointed out, we know what we have as our priorities and that is the systemic reduction of risk over large landscapes.”

(Photo: Getty Images)No one understands the partnership between the earth and its people better than those who steward the land. But for generations, farmers in the Volunteer State could not make direct sales to the public of temperature-controlled foods or canned goods.
That changed in 2022 when state lawmakers passed the Tennessee Food Freedom Act. The bill allowed farmers and other cottage-food producers to sell certain homemade, nonperishable foods, including baked goods and jams, with no need for inspection or licensing.  
Recently, the Tennessee House of Representatives expanded Tennessee’s cottage-food laws with the passage of HB130, enabling Tennessee farmers and food entrepreneurs to legally sell homemade foods that include perishable foods such as dairy, eggs and poultry. 
“This gives small producers more flexibility to meet the growing demand for local, fresh and prepared foods,” said bill sponsor Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican.
The bill does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk and other unpasteurized dairy products.
“We trust each other with food in our communities,” said Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican who sponsored the Food Freedom Act. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Within the past year, lawsuits have been filed against a Florida dairy farm found by the Florida State Health Department to have sold unpasteurized dairy products linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The cases include a pregnant mother who consumed raw milk, became sick and lost her unborn baby.
Elizabeth Stuart has farmed her Crossing Creeks Farm in Shelbyville for the past 12 years, practicing regenerative farming to raise beef cattle, pigs, turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs.
Though the farm has a commercial kitchen, Stuart realizes the importance of the Food Freedom Act for those farms that do not.
“We believe that the Food Freedom Act is an important asset to Tennessee farmers and artisans,” she said. “For example, farmers who have a bumper crop of vegetables, or chicken, meat or eggs, now have the ability to turn that into a value-added product instead of it becoming waste. This increases the amount of local food sources within the state.”
The welfare of local farmers and food entrepreneurs is at the heart of the bil, saud Reneau.
“This bill is about freedom and opportunity,” Reneau said, adding that the new legislation negates the need for inspections and commercial licensing that costs food producers nearly $500. 
“Tennessee families love buying directly from people they know and trust, and small farms and home kitchens want the ability to serve their communities without unnecessary red tape,” she said.
Reneau compares the Food Freedom Act to shared community meals, such as pot-luck dinners with friends and neighbors.
“We already trust each other with food in our communities,” she said. “This simply extends that same trust to local farmers and food entrepreneurs so more of them can start businesses or expand what they offer.”
The Food Freedom Act enables farmers and small-food producers to diversify their offerings, from soups and stews to casseroles with perishable ingredients, such as poultry and dairy, giving the “little guy” a fairer chance to compete or get started in  the food business. 
The idea is to create an incubator of sorts, a stepping stone that may lead to commercial operations in larger cities, while giving those in rural areas with no access to commercial kitchens a viable option to sell locally.
The 2022 Food Freedom Act enabled farmers to sell shelf-stable items requiring no refrigeration or special handling. Now, prepared chicken, such as rotisserie chicken, soups and pot pie, plus butter, eggs, yogurts, hard cheeses and kefir can be sold directly to consumers.
Bird Fork Farm is a Certified Naturally Grown small seed-to-bottle apothecary farm in Dunlap. The farm produces organically grown vegetables, fruits and herbs in addition to locally grown or foraged teas, spices, extracts, syrups, body care products, ferments and vinegars. 
Alysia Leon of Bird Fork says the Food Freedom Act has allowed her farm to cut down on food waste and offer farm-fresh products year-round.  While the farm does not produce meat and dairy products, updates allowing the sale of temperature-controlled foods opens revenue resources once denied Tennessee farmers.
“We know this update has allowed other farmer friends the ability to expand their operations,” Leon says. “It cuts down on food waste to create value-added products, and it gives farmers the benefit of the doubt that they are doing things the right way.”
The bill has received overwhelming approval from cottage-food producers, Reneau said.
“Many have told me they’ve been waiting years to sell more of the foods they already make at home, but costs and regulations have prevented that. Customers are just as excited,” she said. “They want more local choices and more ways to support their neighbors. 
“It’s truly a win-win for producers and consumers, and I hope Tennessee’s Food Freedom Act becomes a model for other states.”

From Shark Tank to the real lives of challenged communities, a virtual pitch show is changing entrepreneurship. I first learned about an innovative approach to global service at a recent Pocatello Rotary Club meeting, where Entrapov founder Ben Davidson gave an inspiring presentation about a program that’s revolutionizing how we think about helping others.
What if you could help someone escape poverty forever in just one hour? A new virtual service project called “Shark Pond” is making that possible for families, businesses, and community groups across America.
Inspired by the hit TV show “Shark Tank,” Shark Pond connects aspiring entrepreneurs from impoverished areas in Africa with potential investors through video conferencing. But unlike the cutthroat television version, this program emphasizes encouragement and genuine support.
“We’re creating real change, one business at a time,” explains Davidson. “These aren’t just feel-good moments. We’re helping people build sustainable livelihoods that lift entire families out of poverty.”
 How it works

The process begins months before the virtual pitch show. Aspiring entrepreneurs undergo intensive three-month training programs where they develop business plans, learn accounting basics, and practice their presentations. They create detailed income statements, cash flow projections, and business proposals; just like contestants on the real Shark Tank.
When pitch day arrives, groups of “sharks” — which could be Rotary clubs, corporate teams, church groups, or even families — log into a video conference to hear business proposals. The entrepreneurs, who all speak fluent English, share their personal stories and business dreams. Proposals range from egg farms and food carts to metalworking shops and tailoring businesses.
After hearing the pitches and asking questions, the groups decide which entrepreneur to sponsor with startup grants. The entire event takes just one hour and costs participating groups around $1,000.
 Real impact, real relationships

Unlike traditional charity models, Shark Pond creates ongoing relationships between sponsors and entrepreneurs. Monthly updates arrive with photos, videos, and success stories showing how the businesses are growing.
“You’re not just writing a check and hoping for the best,” says Shark Pond volunteer Rich Kirkham. “You get to see exactly how your money is being used and build a genuine friendship with someone on the other side of the world.”
The program promises that 100% of donations go directly to Africa for those in need (the entrepreneur and their local mentor), with no money deducted for administrative overhead. This direct-funding model ensures maximum impact for every dollar contributed.
 Perfect for groups

Shark Pond events work particularly well for organizations looking to build team spirit while making a difference. The format requires no travel, minimal time commitment, and creates shared experiences that strengthen group bonds.
Corporate teams have used Shark Pond events during regular meetings, while service clubs incorporate them into their monthly gatherings. The interactive nature of the pitch process encourages participation and discussion among group members.
For communities and organizations seeking meaningful ways to help others without major logistical challenges, Shark Pond offers a compelling solution. It combines the excitement of entrepreneurship with the satisfaction of direct, personal impact. This proves that sometimes the most effective help comes through believing in someone’s dreams and giving them the tools to achieve them.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A conservative activist shot and killed at an Utah college campus. A gunman fatally shoots a Minnesota legislator and her husband, and mortally wounds their beloved dog. Judges and legislators increasingly get threats — and in 2020 a judge’s son was murdered when an assailant came to their door. Roughly 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the Jan.  6, 2021, politically-motivated assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Political violence rightly offends us to the core when we read about it. The lessons are stronger and clearer, however, when it directly comes to your life. This happened to me, my wife, and our church congregation on July 27, 2008. 
That day dawned warm and bright as an unemployed truck driver, Jim David Adkisson, put a modified shotgun into a guitar case and drove to Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville. He also had a bag with 76 shells of #4 shot. He was envisioning a massacre, ending in his death in a police standoff.
The gunman’s home held few books, mostly hate-filled ones penned by talk radio hosts. He had scribbled a note that because he could not kill national liberals and Democrats, he’d kill those who voted for them. He had added some homophobic rants to the notes.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

At the church, a special performance was just beginning — Annie Jr., a condensed version of the musical done almost entirely with a child cast. The one exception was my friend and fellow University of Tennessee professor John Bohstedt, chrome-domed and dressed as Daddy Warbucks, waiting for his entrance.
Adkisson entered the church and reached the back of the sanctuary facing the stage. He removed his gun from the guitar case, pointing it toward the pews stage left and in front of him.  Usher Greg McKendry was near the gunman. Some say he was caught off guard. Others say he stepped toward the shooter. Greg’s broad body took most of the first blast, saving many lives — including, very likely, mine.
Like many, my first indication of the attack was an ear-shattering bang. Instinctively, I dove under the pew. On the way down, I caught a glimpse of the gunman — curly gray hair, silver barrel of a gun in hand, eyes fixed and expressionless — a portrait in the ferocious banality of evil.
Adkisson got off another shot before Bohstedt and several others bravely jumped on and restrained the killer. Our congregation had so many heroes in those moments who kept things from getting worse.
My friend Greg McKendry bled out on the cold floor of the church he loved. Linda Kraeger, a visitor from Westside Unitarian Universalist church and there for the play, also died. Six others were seriously injured.
The short- and long-term aftermath from that day revealed many things. The next few days found the fellowship hall filling with flowers and food, messages from around the globe; counselors were available. Police and prosecutors treated us well, and followed a majority sentiment that Adkisson should be convicted and sentenced to a life term so he never again walks freely among civilized people.
The better angels of our nature were on full display at a nearby church for a special service. Congregations from all over Knoxville were there to uplift us Unitarian Universalist survivors.  Two local UU pastors spoke, as did the president of the Unitarian Universalist Association.



ach year many more people have a searing personal experience with political violence. It leaves you with a deep understanding of how hate festers.  


At the conclusion, children from the play walked, unannounced, to the center of the altar, accompanied by the music director. They sang “Tomorrow” from Annie. The crowd joined in: swaying, hugging strangers, shouting the chorus to the rafters. Becky and I left the event to a steady rain. I quoted to Becky some lines from the old blues lyric “The Sky is Crying.”
The congregation grew and reclaimed our space. The fellowship hall now is named after Greg McKendry. The church library is named after Linda Kraeger. Minister Chris Buice cooperated with a University of Tennessee sociologist who interviewed Adkisson to assess whether a restorative justice model and contact would work. That sociologist classified the shooter as someone who would use contact as an opportunity to inflict more harm – in this case psychological.
Tragically, each year many more people have a searing personal experience with political violence. It leaves you with a deep understanding of how hate festers. You catch yourself from referencing opponents as enemies. You reach out, when possible, to find common ground. You try your best to criticize ideas, not people. You realize that political violence has many causes and triggers, but that gun safety laws could have a beneficial effect. They won’t stop every shooting, but could stop some — and have the added benefit of reducing gun tragedies from accidents and suicides.
You find yourself encouraging critical thinking, fighting for truth, and resisting a world view that elevates sides over learning. Perhaps moved by the deep recesses of memory, you hug a bit more closely, express joy more freely, retain your sense of humor and whimsy, and mention your love to those you love.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A failed Ohio secretary of state candidate backed Tina Peters’ release from prison in a proposed amicus brief filed in federal court in Colorado over the weekend.
In the filing, lawyers for Terpsehore Maras argue that a denial of bail for Peters violates the former Mesa County clerk and recorder’s First Amendment rights and would be an uneven application of Colorado’s bail standards.
“Denying bail to a non-violent defendant with a pending appeal — where state law permits release — serves no legitimate purpose and operates solely as punishment. That result is compounded here by the state’s indifference to Ms. Peters’ health, turning confinement into cruelty,” the filing says.

Earlier this year, Peters, 70, submitted a petition to get a federal court to free her on bond while she appeals her state-level conviction that stems from her scheme to allow an unauthorized person access to her county’s Dominion Voting Systems machines in 2021. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is currently incarcerated at a medium-security facility in Pueblo.
Peters, a Republican, espoused debunked claims about election security and voter fraud after former President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.
During a hearing in July on Peters’ habeas corpus petition, Chief Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak said he could not find a precedent where a federal court granted habeas — or release — on an appeal bond.
Maras — who is also an election denier, podcaster and QAnon supporter — argued in her brief that the bond denial was a punishment for Peters’ statements about election systems rather than a decision to protect the community.
“Colorado law permits bail pending appeal when a defendant is not a flight risk or danger to society. While the decision to grant bail is discretionary, that discretion cannot be exercised in a way that infringes upon constitutional rights. Here, the trial judge’s own words reveal that bail was denied not to ensure appearance or protect the public, but to punish and silence Ms. Peters,” the brief says.
Maras claims the decision would violate Peters’ rights under the First, Eighth, Ninth and 14th Amendments.
“If allowed to stand, this ruling establishes a precedent that bail may be weaponized to silence dissent, chill public discourse, and punish citizens critical of government conduct. That is not the purpose of bail, nor the role of courts in a constitutional democracy,” the brief says.
The brief asserts that, in addition to Maras, there are 3,057 signatories to it whose names lawyers could make available to the court. Anyone can propose an amicus brief, though they are not automatically accepted.
The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the habeas corpus petition to be dismissed because federal court does not have jurisdiction in the state-level case. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has called for Peters’ release multiple times.
On Sept. 17, Varholak gave parties in the petition case two weeks to address the merits of Peters’ habeas petition on First Amendment grounds.

(Photo courtesy of Steven Allen Adams) BECKLEY, W.Va. — Aaron Siri stood at a podium in a third-floor courtroom of the Raleigh County Courthouse in Beckley earlier this month. Consulting a legal pad of notes, the attorney cross examined Dr. Cathy Slemp, who had testified earlier that morning.
“Doctor, what’s the federal Vaccines for Children Program?” he asked the former state health officer.
“It’s a program that the federal government does, that they have federal contracts for vaccines that allows states to purchase off those contracts so that it’s at a lower cost,” she answered.
Just two days earlier, Siri was in Washington, D.C., testifying before the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during a hearing entitled “How the corruption of science has impacted public perception and policies regarding vaccines.”
Siri, a New York-based attorney, has represented federal health secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the anti-vaccine Informed Consent Action Network. Last fall, he reportedly helped Kennedy pick health officials for President Donald Trump’s administration. He’s also petitioned the federal government to suspend or remove approval for the use of the polio vaccine in infants and toddlers until a safety trial is done. 
Now, Siri is part of a legal team representing parents of school children in Raleigh County in their lawsuit against the West Virginia and Raleigh County boards of education. The families are suing the school boards to allow their students to attend class with a religious exemption to the state’s school immunization requirements. 
All states require children attending school to be vaccinated for certain infectious diseases, including polio, chickenpox and measles. West Virginia is one of only five states in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the requirements because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeks to change that. 
The governor issued an executive order early this year requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. The executive order — based on the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act — has not been rescinded even though the West Virginia Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have put the exemptions in state code. 
Raleigh Circuit Judge Michael Froble in July issued a preliminary injunction allowing the children in the case to attend class with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. Attorneys representing the families have asked the judge for class action status. 
When West Virginia Watch asked Siri about his interest in the lawsuit, and in West Virginia’s compulsory school vaccination law generally, Siri referred a reporter to his Dec. 20, 2022 post on the social media platform X, to his recent congressional testimony, and to his book, “Vaccines, Amen: The Religion of Vaccines.”
“Mandates are the tool of bullies, criminals and dictators,” he wrote in the post. “If a patient refuses a medical product after being conveyed its benefits and risks, then that is called informed consent. They were informed and did not consent. Mandating over this objection is immoral and illiberal.”
He added in an email, “Protecting everybody’s right to [informed] consent and medical liberty is important no matter what state they are in.”
While Morrisey has expressed support for the families suing the boards of education, the state is not compensating Siri for his work representing the plaintiffs, according to Morrisey’s office. 
Froble held a two-day hearing on a permanent injunction in the case on Sept. 10 and 11. 
Attorneys and the judge heard from Slemp, who argued that the state’s school compulsory vaccination law — without religious or philosophical exemptions — is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. Even a small number of religious or philosophical exemptions would increase disease, she said. 
The school board has appealed the judge’s preliminary ruling to the state Supreme Court, which has signaled that it would consider it no sooner than early next year. 
The hearing on a permanent injunction in the case is expected to continue in Froble’s Beckley courtroom’s Oct. 8 and 9. The judge has subpoenaed the state’s current acting state health officer, Dr. Mark McDaniel, who agrees with Morrisey on religious exemptions, to testify during that hearing.

Tammy Baldwin | Collage of screenshots via ZoomLast time the government was on the brink of a shutdown, Democratic leaders rushed to negotiate with Republicans and reached a deal to keep federal agencies open and basic services flowing. Now that deal is about to expire and there seems to be little appetite for compromise in Washington. 
President Donald Trump has directed Republicans “don’t even bother dealing with” Democrats, and the House rammed through a near-party-line resolution to keep the government open that ignored Democratic demands and had no Democratic input at all. 
“We’re not sure how serious they are about actually trying to have something done by September 30,” Wisconsin Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters in his Madison office Wednesday. Trump had just canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, and the House isn’t even in session during the last days of September, as the shutdown clock winds down. 
Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) called the Democratic caucus back anyway, “so I’ll be flying Monday out to Washington,” Pocan said.  “Hopefully they’ll decide we’ve got work to do. But you know, this is something where we don’t run the House or the Senate or the White House.” In other words, if the government shuts down, it’s the Republicans’ fault. Republicans, who don’t appear worried about a shutdown, say the opposite, rolling their eyes at Democrats’ demands that a stopgap government funding bill must reverse Medicaid cuts and extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year and without which an estimated 5 million Americans will no longer be able to afford any health insurance at all.
A shutdown means hardship for people who depend on government services and could harm the whole economy, “But at the same time,” Pocan said, “we’re trying to fight for people who lost their health care and other things from what we call the Big, Ugly Law.”
Pocan cited data from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF on likely health insurance premium hikes in Wisconsin if the ACA tax credits are not extended. A KFF calculator estimates premium increases for families of different sizes and income levels in every state. A family of four earning $130,000 per year in Wisconsin could see premiums jump by as much as $1,588 per month or $19,081 per year, according to the calculator.
Nationwide, premiums will soar by more than 75% if the credits expire, according to KFF.
Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin has called for legislation she introduced earlier this year to make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent to be included in any stopgap bill to avert a shutdown.
In a joint statement, Democratic leaders of the House and Senate criticized House Republicans for ignoring their pleas to address the expiring ACA tax credits, writing, “at a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, Republicans refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.” 
The sudden jump in health insurance premiums, combined with high costs for consumer goods because of Trump’s tariffs, will hit voters just ahead of the midterm elections, which take place right after the ACA tax credits are set to expire. Politics alone should make the idea of forestalling the sudden cliff appealing. But this is no ordinary Republican party. Back in their districts, ducking in-person meetings with constituents, members of Congress who voted for the Big Beautiful Bill Act to slash health care, food assistance and federal agencies that serve their constituents are still in lockstep with Trump. No wonder they don’t care if the entire government grinds to a halt.
A shutdown will be bad. But what Trump and the Republicans have in store for Americans is worse. 
More than the effects of a shutdown, said Pocan, “I’m far more concerned about what they just did to people that we need to try to fix, and if they’re not willing to have those conversations with us — that’s a big problem.”

And this work is just beginning. We’ve launched a 55 county tour to shine a light on the largest cuts to health care in our nation’s history.
I’ve had the pleasure of being an occasional guest on MetroNews Midday with Dave Allen and Amanda Barren to talk about health care and emerging policy that will affect West Virginian’s ability to afford and access health care. I always enjoy the experience and look forward to educating West Virginians about the realities of how policy choices made by our representatives — on our behalf — can affect their families and their daily lives.  
On my most recent appearance, I was asked how is it that you say Medicaid cuts will devastate West Virginia’s health care infrastructure, yet Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was just in our studios and said Medicaid was not cut at all?
My response: I don’t understand how the senator can claim that. Surely, she has read the bill.  
Medicaid is West Virginia’s single largest source of federal funding. It sustains thousands of jobs, keeps rural hospitals and clinics open, and injects billions into our local economy each year. In fact, Medicaid spending in West Virginia totals $5.5 billion annually, with 82% of that supported by federal dollars.
Read that again: 82% of our state’s Medicaid funding — the largest health insurance program in our state — comes from the federal government. 
Over 500,000 West Virginians count on this coverage — from our youngest to our oldest, and everyone in between — including working families, people with disabilities, and those who need expensive or long-term care they couldn’t afford on their own.
According to Families USA, , H.R. 1 is devastating for West Virginia, stripping more than $666 million each year in federal Medicaid funding. The damage will only grow as the provider tax is reduced and gradually phased out in Medicaid expansion states like ours, all while a moratorium blocks any new or increased provider taxes. 
This matters. The provider tax — a levy placed on hospitals, nursing homes and managed care organizations — is a critical source of state revenue for Medicaid. It serves as the primary funding mechanism for the state’s share of Medicaid costs, allowing West Virginia to draw down billions in additional federal dollars. Those funds support both mandatory and optional Medicaid services. Limiting or phasing out this tax, is in effect, a direct threat to the foundation of Medicaid’s funding in our state. 
Mandatory essential services 

Early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment: Comprehensive health services for individuals under 21
Federally qualified health center services
Home health services for those who are eligible for nursing facility care
Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
Laboratory and X-ray services
Nurse-midwife services
Nursing facility services for adults over 21
Physician services
Rural Health Clinic (RHC) services
Transportation to and from medical care 

Optional services 

Ambulance transportation
Dental services: West Virginia covers dental for children, but coverage for adults is generally limited to emergency services
Eyeglasses and optometry services
Hospice care
Intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities
Mental and behavioral health services
Personal care services
Prescription drugs
Psychological services
Rehabilitation service.
Speech, hearing, and language services
Waiver services including: 

Aged and disabled waiver
Children with serious emotional disorder waiver
Intellectual and/or developmental disabilities waiver
Traumatic brain injury waiver



What do our lawmakers cut first — dental care, mental and behavioral health, nursing home care or the waiver that supports West Virginians with disabilities? These are the devastating choices that Capito Care has forced onto our state lawmakers and onto our communities.
It doesn’t have to be this way. H.R. 1 was a choice — a policy decision led by our senior senator, Shelley Moore Capito, and backed by Sen. Jim Justice, Rep. Carol Miller and Rep. Riley Moore. Capito Care weakens Medicaid across the board, straining our health care infrastructure, reducing access, and raising costs for everyone. The truth is: Medicaid didn’t need saving, but after these reckless cuts it does. These cuts must never see implementation.

(Photo: Getty Images/bluecinema)North Carolina’s Problem Gambling Helpline answered more than 8,100 calls in the last fiscal year, more than an 11% increase from 2024.
The numbers were unveiled Wednesday by Amanda Winters, the state’s problem gambling program administrator, at the North Carolina State Lottery Commission’s September meeting.
Winters said over the past 16 years, the lottery has always been the primary reason people called the helpline. This year, sports betting was the top reason. Casinos came in second.
“When we looked at the demographics in the helpline of sports betting compared to non-sports betting, we found that the people who were calling were of a younger age between 18 and 34,” said Winters. “And with sports betting, people were likely to experience the problem for less than one year, which means that they went from no harm or minimal risk to severe risk within a shorter time span.”
That differs from non-sports bettors who tend to be slightly older (age 24-44) and may have gambled longer (more than three years) before realizing there was a problem.

One troubling trend is that sports bettors were less likely to accept treatment, Winters said. They were, however, more likely to text or chat, something that correlates to the younger age-range of participants.
The report also revealed that when it came to how others were affected, 25% of those seeking help were spouses of non-sports bettors. In the case of sports-betting, 50% of the calls were coming from concerned parents.
Winters said she could attest to those stats. As she was getting ready to start the presentation, her dedicated line that she affectionately calls “the bat phone” rang.
“More than likely it’s somebody’s parent calling me.”
Programs like GamFin have helped individuals who are experiencing problems with gambling, better understand their relationship with money, and helped reduce anxiety.
But Winters acknowledged it is challenge to reach today’s youth, who spend hours each day in front of a screen.
“Adolescents and 20% of adults who played free games moved to commercial games.” she warned. “So, we need to consider the digital world and digital media literacy as a way to educate youth on what they’re engaging with. We also want to focus on emotional regulation, so they don’t look for activities like online distractions to cope with difficult emotions.”
Another study found 34% of video gamers have engaged in online gambling.
She suggested the state needs to start educating young people and debunking myths at an earlier age.
Winters cited a recent survey of understudied populations by East Carolina University’s Gambling Research and Policy Institute (GRPI) that found 46% of college students believed they would eventually win big. Forty percent said they believed they could win back their losses; nearly one-third (32%) believed that gambling would solve their financial problems.
“That’s alarming,” Winters told lottery commission members.

GRPI has created a Betting Blueprint to help educate college students on what is healthy gambling, financial wellness, and how to evaluate risk. The program also helps students understand how social media influencers and loyalty programs are merely marketing tools used to draw them in.
“Sounds like there are a lot of moving parts with emerging trends,” said Ripley Rand, chairman of the state lottery commission. “The information is very helpful.”
The North Carolina Education Lottery contributes $1 million to the state’s problem gambling helpline annually. When sports betting was authorized, the legislature earmarked an additional $2 million for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services’ Problem Gambling Program.
Greg Bowers, chief financial officer for North Carolina’s lottery, said total lottery sales for fiscal 2025 totaled nearly $6.6 billion.
“That represents the highest sales total since our inception. And was $1.2 billion more than sales generated the year before in fiscal ’24,” Bowers told the group. “All of the surplus can be attributed to digital instants sales.”
While traditional lottery sales were down by 6% from the prior year, games played online generated $2.6 billion for the fiscal year, the first full year for this category.
And in August, North Carolinians spent $463 million on paid sports wagering, outpacing August 2024 numbers by about 30 percent.

A new analysis put New Jersey at the top of the list of states without enough funds to cover all government costs and debt obligations. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Half of American states do not have enough funds to pay their bills, according to a new analysis released Thursday. 
The nonprofit Truth in Accounting, which advocates for more transparency in public finance, released its Financial State of the States report. It concluded that 25 states were unable to cover all their financial obligations at the end of fiscal year 2024, which for most states ended June 30. 
While most states mandate balanced budgets, the report says elected officials often use workarounds by excluding exclude certain costs such aslike future pension obligations and deferred maintenance from their budget calculations.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

“This practice essentially shifts these financial responsibilities onto future taxpayers, leaving them to cover the expenses that should have been accounted for in the current budget,” the report states.
In total, Truth in Accounting calculated states hold $2.2 trillion in assets and $2.9 trillion in debts. At $832 billion, unfunded pension obligations are the largest driver of state debts, according to the report. 
Truth in Accounting sorts states based on their ability to cover their debts. The top “sinkhole states” — states lacking the funds to cover their costs — were New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and California.
Conversely, 25 states touted a surplus of funds relative to their total costs and debts. The top surplus states were North Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming, Utah and Tennessee. 
Rather than funding promises of pension payouts and retiree healthcare, some elected officials in those states have used those funds to keep taxes low and pay for politically popular programs, the report said. That can make a state budget appear balanced, though its debt continues to increase — the equivalent of charging “a credit card without having the money to pay off the debt.”
The report grades the finances of each state, including a look at its total assets, unfunded liabilities and debts. It also calculates the overall costs to each resident: Kentucky, for example, would need $11,500 from each of its taxpayers to pay all of its outstanding bills, according to the report.
Truth in Accounting lobbies for greater transparency in government and has suggested legislation on the matter. The organization says governments should publish budgets that show the full scope of their debts and future obligations. 
“A representative form of government depends on an informed electorate; however, due to current practices in accounting and budgeting, a state’s true financial health is usually obscured, and citizens are deceived or, at best, misled,” the report said. “Without access to truthful, timely, and transparent information, how can citizens be knowledgeable participants in their governments?”

Rep. Brett Guthrie, Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul objected to interference by Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, in the controversy over remarks by late-night talker Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk. Their pushback, and that of others, likely led Carr to back off and ABC to reinstate Kimmel’s show, which it had suspended after Carr bluntly intimidated the network and its affiliates.

Contrary to the beliefs of many Kirk fans, Kimmel said nothing bad about him. On the day of the murder, he used social media to condemn it and send love to Kirk’s family. He said on his show, “The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” His second assertion was accurate, but his first rested on a bad presumption that the killer was a MAGA man. There was some evidence suggesting that possibility at the time Kimmel spoke, but it soon proved off base, giving Carr an opening.
Carr said in a podcast interview, “In some quarters there’s a very concerted effort to try lie to the American people about the nature, as you indicate, of one of the most significant, newsworthy, public-interest acts that we’ve seen in a long time, and what appears to be an action, appears to be action, by Jimmy Kimmel playing into that narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person.”
Saying he was trying to strengthen the FCC’s enforcement of the law that requires broadcasters to serve the public interest, Carr went overboard: “Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there’s gonna be additional work for the FCC ahead. . . . There’s calls for him to be fired; you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this. The FCC is gonna have remedies that we could look at.”
U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
It didn’t take long for Nexstar Media Group, which is seeking FCC approval of a merger that would violate current local-TV ownership limits, to say that its 20-plus ABC affiliates would stop airing Kimmel indefinitely. The suspension quickly followed, and Carr exulted, “We’re not done yet.”
Not so fast. The next day, Thursday, Sept. 18, Guthrie said “We have to be extremely cautious to not try to use government to influence what people say.” Guthrie chairs the House committee that oversees the FCC, so he probably got Carr’s attention.
Three days later, on “Meet the Press,” Paul said, “Brendan Carr’s got no business weighing in on this. … I’ll fight any attempt to get the government involved with speech.” 
Massie, who has drawn Trump’s ire and an effort to defeat him, called Carr’s remarks “antithetical to the First Amendment.”
The strongest objection came from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who said Carr’s “easy way or the hard way” line was “dangerous as hell” and sounded like the mobster movie “Goodfellas.”
Sen. Mitch McConnell agreed with Cruz. “As a First Amendment guy, I think he’s probably got it right,” said McConnell, who selectively picks his battles with Trump and commented on X after I made an inquiry to his office Monday. He added, “You don’t have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn’t be getting involved here.”
Rep. James Comer replied to my inquiry: “The federal government must never interfere with Americans’ constitutional right to free speech.” Republican Reps. Hal Rogers and Andy Barr, who wants Trump’s endorsement for the Senate, didn’t reply before my Tuesday morning deadline. The only Democrat in the Kentucky delegation, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, said, “This administration is blatantly threatening broadcasters’ licenses as a punishment because Donald Trump disagrees with what’s being said about him. That’s a clear case of censorship, it should be disavowed by everyone, and shake our country to its core when we see the President actively silencing his critics.”
Some conservatives say Carr’s remarks were analogous to Biden health officials asking social-media platforms to suppress misinformation that might have made the Covid-19 pandemic more deadly. But they made no gangster-like threats, which our proto-dictator and some of his allies seem to enjoy.
In December, X owner Elon Musk said, “Legacy media must die.” That’s a rejection of the basic concept of the news business, which pays for journalism. (They are separate things.) When the nation’s electronic news business becomes dominated by corporations who stand to gain or lose billions at the hands of the government, and the government pressures them to squelch certain voices, we begin to look more like Hungary than the country we have always known. So let’s be glad some Kentucky Republicans spoke up. And wish they would on some other stuff.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin criticized the Palmyra Police Department in Jefferson County, saying it is “partnering hand in glove with ICE to carry out this regime’s plan to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones.” 
In a statement to the Examiner, interim police chief Paul Blount said the department’s focus is on criminals who threaten public safety and that this is “not a blanket immigration enforcement program.” Blount was not immediately available for an interview. 
“If we find out that we have to participate in that aspect of it, where we’re actually going out, actively enforcing immigration policy and procedure and door to door, looking for undocumented individuals, then I would go on record on saying that we won’t participate in that,” Blount said, according to WISN 12 News. 
He said that the agreement could be what keeps a local police department in the village, due to financial challenges, according to WISN 12 News. He also said there is a $100,000 incentive for the first arrest of an undocumented person that has been involved in a crime or is wanted, and $7,500 for each subsequent arrest. 
According to WISN 12 News, Blount said that if the federal government approves the agreement, he would not move forward without approval from the village board. ICE’s online list currently shows Palmyra as a participating agency and includes Monday, Sept. 22 as the date of signature. 
The Task Force Model serves as a “force multiplier,” according to ICE. It allows officers to enforce limited immigration authority while performing routine police duties, such as identifying a person who is not a U.S. citizen or national during a driving under the influence stop and sharing information directly with ICE. Agencies can carry out immigration enforcement activities under ICE supervision and oversight. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin said the department is “even taking it a step further than other agencies, instituting the most aggressive 287(g) model that gives officers the green light to stop people they think might be immigrants on the street, question them about their citizenship status, and even take them into custody.”
The 287(g) program allows a local law enforcement agency to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law. According to ICE’s online list,  Palmyra is the only police department in the state with a 287(g) agreement. There are 13 Wisconsin counties with a sheriff’s department partnering with ICE. These partnerships use the warrant service officer model or jail enforcement model, which are focused on local jails. 
In the statement to the Examiner, Blount said that if the program is approved, it would allow officers to work in closer partnership with federal authorities. He said officers would gain access to databases and resources that help investigations and help combat serious crimes, such as narcotics trafficking and human trafficking. 
“This is a tool, not a blanket immigration enforcement program,” Blount said. “Our focus is on criminals who threaten public safety — not law-abiding residents. The core mission of our department remains unchanged: responding to emergencies, enforcing traffic safety, and preventing crime in our community.” 
The ACLU of Wisconsin also raised concern about racial profiling. Stateline reported that the task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 after a Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination in an Arizona task force. 
“This program tears apart communities and instills fear, and we must reject it in Wisconsin and everywhere else,” the ACLU said. 
According to WISN 12 News, Blount said he will ensure there is a policy or procedure in place if the village does move forward so that residents “are protected from being profiled.”

Kevin (Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Voters in Colorado for decades could be confident their information was secure in the hands of election officials. The behavior of the Trump administration puts that confidence in doubt.
The administration is rifling through voter rolls obtained from states, including Colorado, in a nefarious search for noncitizen voters, even though the purported phenomenon of noncitizen voting is virtually nonexistent. The exercise is really a bad-faith voter suppression effort directed by President Donald Trump and undertaken amid a raft of administration attempts to undermine elections.
While Colorado election officials have taken steps to defend the state’s election system, which experts often laud as the “gold standard,” individual voters can take an active role in protecting their own rights. Authoritarians want the people to be pliant, but Coloradans can refuse to bend.

The Trump administration’s election saboteurs have made Colorado its primary target. Starting in May, the U.S. Department of Justice demanded that states hand over election information, including detailed voter lists and other sensitive data. Colorado received the most sweeping request. A top Justice Department official, citing an unspecified allegation of election record “noncompliance,” demanded that Jena Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, supply “all records” related to the 2024 election.
At least 36 states received demands for election records, and all 50 states reportedly can expect to receive one. The administration’s mass compilation of voter data might violate federal privacy law, say some election law scholars.
Some state election officials have welcomed the demands. The Republican secretaries of state in Indiana and Alabama have agreed to work with federal immigration officials to search for noncitizens in their own voter rolls. But others have rebuffed the administration. 


Every Colorado voter should apply for confidential status. 


New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter roll. Maine’s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, has been the most outspoken election official in rejecting the administration’s attempts to gather voter information. Her response to the DOJ: “Go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The administration’s true aim is to subvert democracy, many election experts argue.
“This isn’t just a clear violation of voter privacy — it’s a major federal overreach and an attempt by a corrupt Department of Justice to attack Trump’s political opponents and undermine our electoral process,” said Ariel Hayes, the executive director of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of States.
Griswold agrees.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline in July. 
However, Colorado did turn over some data to the administration. This comprised two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November, according to Jack Todd, a spokesperson for the secretary of state.

Unlike elsewhere, such as New Hampshire, where state law precluded release of voter information to the administration, Colorado was legally bound to supply the information, Todd said.
Earlier this month, the administration confirmed that the Justice Department had shared state election data with the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Colorado election officials were dismayed by this development.
“DHS has provided conflicting information on this subject,” Todd said in an email. “Earlier this month, Secretaries of State were told by a DHS official that the DHS has not received voter data and would not use such data — shortly before the opposite was reported. The Department is extremely concerned by this communication and that DHS may be actively misleading to election officials.”
Now that their information is exposed to federal agencies that are hostile to their rights, Coloradans can push back. Every Colorado voter should apply for confidential status. The state allows voters to restrict release of their information if they attest to fear of harassment or bodily harm. All Coloradans can now demonstrate a credible risk of harassment from their own federal government, and they can substantiate that fear simply by citing multiple statements from Griswold.
“Trump is abusing his power in an attempt to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box,” she said in April.
“What they’re going to do with all this data, I don’t know … But I’m sure they will use it to push their ridiculous disinformation and lies to the American public,” she said in June.
More than 109,000 Coloradans are already confidential voters. Confidential status might not help voters who appear on the lists already transferred to the administration, but it could protect new voters, and it could safeguard the Colorado electorate if administration mischief persists into the 2028 presidential election cycle.
Coloradans should also monitor their voter status. A page on the secretary of state’s website allows them to check their registration and verify it’s active.
The administration’s demand for voter information is just one aspect of its wide-ranging efforts to make elections less free and fair. Trump is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots — the kind of ballot that goes to every active voter in Colorado every election. Trump’s recent deployment of National Guard troops to areas of the country led by Democrats is seen by some, such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, as a prelude to military patrols around polls next year.
How can people respond to such intimidation?
“Speak up, megaphones and microphones, however you can, and make sure you show up and are absolutely focused on getting to the ballot box and voting,” Pritzker said.
That’s more advice Colorado voters should heed.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As the Virginia Military Institute’s Board of Visitors awaits the state Supreme Court’s determination on the future of several gubernatorial appointments, the governing board has continued its duties, including making recent, significant changes to its bylaws and modifying the board’s responsibilities relating to diversity and inclusion.
The changes, which also included reassigning mental health oversight responsibilities, come amid pushback by conservatives who oppose diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, specifically in schools, and after the school renamed its DEI office in 2023.
“This is all a routine review of the bylaws, which we do regularly to ensure clarity and compliance with any legal updates,” Sherry Wallace, a VMI spokesperson, replied when asked to clarify the rationale for the changes.
The board moved the responsibilities of “mental and physical health” and “diversity and inclusion” from its Cadet and Personnel Affairs Committee to the renamed Operations and Personnel Affairs Committee.
The committee’s responsibilities now state it “shall have oversight of all matters related to human resources, classified and administrative/professional faculty compensation, inspector general, Title IX, inclusive excellence, information technology, VMI police, and post safety, security, and emergency management.”
VMI published an earlier version of the proposed bylaws, which excluded any mention of diversity and inclusion, last week. The board voted on a second version, published on Monday, during Wednesday’s business meeting.
VMI’s approach to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives has been widely scrutinized since April 2023, when Martin Brown, the state diversity, opportunity and inclusion office director appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the institute.
In 2022, Youngkin renamed the state’s DEI office to Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion. The institution then renamed its office as well, which is “responsible for implementation of the Institute’s inclusive excellence program,” Wallace said.
The Spirit of VMI PAC, a political action committee comprising alumni, parents, and students, has expressed strong opposition to DEI initiatives. 
The PAC urged supporters to “reject the woke assault on VMI,” which ultimately led to the removal of Wins, who had worked to implement DEI reforms and expand related offices.
Virginia state law requires agency heads to follow specific responsibilities regarding personnel management and the establishment of diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plans, which includes creating an infrastructure to “effectively support ongoing progress and achievements” by reporting DEI goals in coordination with the DEI director’s initiatives.
Board Member Thomas Gottwald, appointed by Youngkin, stated that the bylaws have been updated five times in the last four years, noting that “they need to adjust as our practices change and to make sure we stay in compliance with state code.”
He said the revisions are also in realignment with the board’s committee structure and responsibilities, which vary. The board can have up to 16 members. Currently, the board has 10 voting members, all of whom have been appointed by Youngkin. 
The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the VMI board appointees, among others, made by the governor, and sued three university leaders over the matter. The administration wants the Virginia Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s decision that temporarily suspended the appointments of these individuals, along with others at George Mason University and the University of Virginia.
VMI’s list of changes to the bylaws also includes transferring several responsibilities to the executive committee, such as providing advice to the board president on committee structure, appointments and meetings, as well as overseeing the institute’s government relations programs. 
The board voted to rename the External Relations Advancement Committee to the Advancement Committee and added the responsibility of oversight for “all strategic communications and marketing, as well as for coordinating between the Board and the VMI Alumni Agencies for alumni relations initiatives and strategic fundraising priorities.”
The changes include designating up to 30 minutes during meetings for public comment, with individuals limited to three minutes, and eliminating the Nominating and Governance Committee (N&G). The executive committee will take up the N&G committee’s responsibilities. 
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, a VMI graduate, questioned some of the changes.
“The VMI BOV President, Jamie Inman, appears to be consolidating authority to himself and the executive committee with no oversight,” Carroll Foy said in a statement to the Mercury.
VMI board ousts first Black superintendent in controversial vote

She also questioned the board’s intention to expand the executive committee’s “reach” to include fundraising, which she said “has always been under the purview of the Alumni Association and the Keydet Club.” And, she insisted that the board’s recent action is a “power grab by the VMI Board to significantly change the bylaws and the operation of the board before the next election.”
VMI’s Board of Visitors also welcomed its 16 superintendent, retired U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. David Furness, to his first business meeting on Wednesday. The board announced the Furness’ hiring of the institution’s 16th superintendent last month after ousting Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent. The updated bylaws will now give the superintendent the authority to call special meetings as permitted by state law.
Previously, special meetings could only be called by the board president, majority vote of the executive committee, or at the request of a majority of board members.

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)After the State Corporation Commission heard nearly 100 public comments earlier this month mostly opposing the peaker gas plant the state’s biggest utility wants to operate in Chesterfield, arguments for the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center started Tuesday.
It’s up to the SCC to decide if the project is needed and reasonable for ratepayers to cover. The plant planned by Dominion Energy – dubbed the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC) – would only run about 37% of the time but the project has neighbors sparring over if it should be built at all. 
Dominion touts the plant as critical to ensuring the grid does not collapse on high-use days amid skyrocketing energy demands, in part due to the growth of data centers in the commonwealth.
“Dispatchable generation resources are an integral component of this solution, and in the near term, this means new gas required resources, including the CERC,” said Joseph Reid, an attorney for Dominion. “It is clear that no single resource will comprehensively address this question, but CERC is an important installment that will meet the need for cold start peaking capacity, and it can be operational within the next four years.”
The 1000 megawatt CERC is slated to be built on the site of a former coal plant just north of the Dutch Gap conservation area, near neighborhoods made up mostly of Hispanic and Black people. The coal plant fully retired in 2018 after burning for over 70 years. There are still two gas units that run year-round on site generating about 420MW of power. Considering these facts, opponents say the planned plant would constitute environmental discrimination.
“The company’s own documents reflect that the gas plant’s operation would emit at least eight other regulated pollutants, and healthcare costs associated with exposure to these pollutants are not included in the company’s economic analysis,” said Rachel James, an attorney for Appalachian Voices and other organizations in the case against the plant. “The Commission cannot ensure that no group of people bears a disproportionate share of any negative environmental consequence of the gas plants construction and operation based on this record.”
The CERC is the first of six proposed gas plants that Dominion says are needed in order to meet the growing energy demands of the commonwealth and the PJM grid at large, which encompasses multiple East Coast states. The CERC will have the ability to power up in a matter of minutes to help ease grid strain on the hottest and coldest days of the year when power demand is highest. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently spoke at the multi-state technical conference for PJM, the regional grid provider. He said that relying solely on wind and solar power would not be enough to meet the state’s needs, and added he has been working to expand Virginia’s energy profile into an “all of the above” plan. He has repeatedly joined other governors in petitioning PJM to speed up their process to bring more power projects onto the grid to increase reliability.
“We need energy and power strategies that deliver and being ignored by PJM just flat doesn’t work. … We are working on legislation that will allow Virginia to reassess if Virginia can continue to be a part of PJM,” Youngkin said.
Residents in the area who oppose the plant told the SCC that under the terms of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the multi-billion dollar project would have to be retired by 2045. They also pointed out that coal ash only recently stopped being released in the community and they don’t want additional pollutants being emitted in the air. They also said they believe the energy needs can be met with solar, wind, and battery storage.
“The commission should also be concerned about the long term implications of approving this project, regardless of how the mission rules here, the VCEA still presumptively requires fossil fuels to retire by 2045 approving a fossil plant of CERC size will make it that much harder to retire the company’s carbon emitting fleet without significant reliability concerns,”  Claire Horan, an attorney representing the Sierra Club, said.
Multiple public hearings for the plant and its air permit application have drawn hundreds of community members and support from some lawmakers, who said they are concerned about being sure the lights will turn on when they flip the switch each day. State Sen. Glen Sturtevant, Del. Mark Earley, and Del. Kim Taylor signed on to testimony for the case in favor of the new plant.
“Our citizens, employers, hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure require a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. While renewable sources are an important part of our energy portfolio, they are by their very nature intermittent. During periods of peak demand, severe weather, or low renewable output, natural gas generation is indispensable to maintaining grid stability and avoiding blackouts,” their testimony read.
Conversely, 20 Democratic state legislators signed a letter against the CERC project. Among those on the list are Del. Rip Sullivan of Fairfax, who helped craft the VCEA and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, who is running for lieutenant governor.
“This proposed gas-powered plant undermines Virginia’s commitments to transition to a clean and renewable economy by 2050, ignores the Commonwealth’s policy on environmental justice, and endangers the public health and safety of environmental and fence-line communities,” the letter read.
Dominion is currently building the largest offshore wind project in the county, which is slated to come online in 2026. They also run large utility-scale solar projects. Despite those clean energy investments, the company insists gas must be part of the energy profile to ensure reliability.
The SCC commissioners are expected to make a decision on whether the project can move forward in the coming months.

For solar energy, 2025 is the best of times and the worst of times. It’s the fastest growing energy source in the world and the largest source of new power capacity additions in the U.S. for the fifth year in a row. Even in the absence of tax subsidies, solar is the cheapest source of new electricity in Virginia, and indeed almost everywhere. 
Yet the congressional Republican budget law’s early termination of tax incentives for solar, together with the Trump administration’s determined efforts to restore fossil fuel dominance, make these dark days for the solar industry. The EPA is relaxing pollution standards for power plants and refusing to enforce regulations, and the same law that cut clean energy credits provided tens of billions of dollars in tax subsidies for drilling and mining activities. (What, did you think they wanted to level the playing field?)  
As a result, analysts project a sharp drop-off in solar installations in the coming years, posing a challenge to energy reliability and affordability. With data centers driving up the demand for electricity, the loss of tax credits for solar will mean higher costs for our utilities, and therefore higher utility bills for customers. Virginians who worry about high electricity bills should be very unhappy with the rollback of these incentives. 
 How the rollbacks could push solar forward (at least for now)

Ironically, though, the coming end of tax credits has goosed the U.S. solar market in the near term. The industry has never been busier, as companies scramble to get projects completed in time to qualify for the tax credits before they expire. With careful planning, solar developers will be able to stretch tax credit eligibility to cover projects for a few more years, softening the blow for consumers. 
And in the long term, the solar industry feels confident that the technical and cost advantages of renewable energy will win out in America as they continue to do abroad. Politics and policy aside, utility-scale solar is the cheapest, cleanest and fastest-to-build electricity source available in most of the U.S. The technology continues to push efficiencies up and costs down, while protecting Americans from the pollution and fuel costs of coal and gas. With energy storage technologies following the same price trajectory as solar, it is hard to imagine the U.S. willingly turning its back on clean energy for long.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

In Virginia, of course, utility solar still faces rural resistance. But having embraced data centers, Virginia will have to find the energy to power them, and price has a way of winning out. 
While the solar industry overall will survive, the loss of federal tax credits is landing hard on the segment that serves homeowners and businesses. The economic case for distributed solar has never been a slam-dunk in Virginia, given the higher costs involved. Now the question is whether it can remain even a reasonable investment.
The Virginia solar industry has grown a lot in the past decade and now includes 199 companies employing close to 5,000 workers, almost double the number employed in coal mining. I haven’t seen numbers specific to distributed solar, but installing solar on rooftops is more labor-intensive than utility solar. More importantly, these jobs tend to be local to Virginia, and most don’t require a college degree. 
Distributed solar is also important to our energy supply and resilience. Sunny rooftops could potentially supply as much as 20% of Virginia’s electricity, yet less than 3% of Virginia homes have solar now, leaving plenty of room for growth. Rooftop solar is also a vital component of community resilience; when batteries are added to solar, buildings can remain powered during storms and other events that take down the wider grid. And of course, solar and batteries can form the basis for virtual power plants that support the grid and reduce the need for utility investments. 
 A trifecta of solar success

Three policies have enabled the industry to succeed here, and all three have been subject to attack. The first, of course, is the federal tax credits, which allow owners of solar arrays to recover 30% of project costs through their tax returns. For residential customers, availability of this credit will now expire at the end of 2025. 
The good news is that structuring residential solar installations as leases or power purchase agreements puts projects under a more favorable provision that gives commercial owners of solar panels until July of 2027 to begin construction. This won’t work for everybody, and residential power purchase agreements are currently legal in Virginia only for low-income customers, but it does offer some breathing room. 
The second policy critical for rooftop solar is a Virginia program that lets owners of solar arrays earn money from the sale of solar renewable electricity certificates (SRECs) associated with the electricity they put onto the grid. The Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) requires Dominion Energy Virginia to buy SRECs to meet a small fraction of its renewable energy purchase obligation. Customers with solar who choose to sell their SRECs can offset some of their costs this way, making solar more affordable. (Since SRECs represent the “bragging rights” to solar – the legal right to claim you are powering your home or business with solar – not everyone wants to sell theirs.)
Customers and industry members say, however, that the Virginia SREC market is neither robust nor transparent. The price that Dominion pays for SRECs would have to be substantially higher to overcome the loss of federal tax credits. Some advocates have floated the idea of asking the tech companies to support the distributed solar market through voluntary SREC purchases, which could raise SREC values and help localities build more solar on schools and other public buildings.
A bipartisan-backed bill that Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed this year would have increased the percentage of Dominion’s electricity that must come from distributed solar generation. This would have incentivized more rooftop solar and possibly resulted in higher SREC prices through the normal economics of supply and demand. But so far there is no plan to set a floor on SREC prices.
The third supportive policy for distributed solar is net metering, which ensures that customers of Dominion and Appalachian Power get credited at the retail rate for surplus electricity they supply to the grid. Customers pay the utility only for the net energy they purchase. While this doesn’t make rooftop solar cheaper, it does mean customers don’t actually lose money on their surplus generation, as they would without net metering.
Appalachian Power’s effort to undermine rooftop solar meets stiff opposition

Dominion and APCo have tried repeatedly to undermine net metering, so far without success.
The State Corporation Commission recently rejected a proposal from APCo to replace one-for-one credits with a payment system valuing distributed solar at the utility’s avoided cost for energy – about one-third of retail. The effect on customers would have been severe, making it impossible for most new buyers to recoup the cost of solar panels. In rejecting APCo’s proposal, the SCC cited expert analyses showing that the value of customer-sited solar to the grid and the public equals or exceeds the retail cost of energy. 
Dominion has also filed a proposal to gut net metering in its territory. Its replacement program differs from APCo’s, yet it too results in a greatly reduced compensation rate. The SCC has not ruled on Dominion’s request yet, but it’s hard to see how Dominion could succeed where APCo failed.
Net metering is the rock that Virginia’s rooftop solar industry is built on, so the SCC’s decision preserving the program was critical to the industry’s very survival. Net metered solar will also remain an appealing hedge against rising electricity rates for many people. Still, there is no getting around the fact that losing the 30% tax credit is the kind of blow that can send an industry off a cliff.  
 What’s next

What can the industry, or policy-makers, do to counteract the loss of tax credits?
The most obvious step is for the General Assembly to once again pass legislation increasing the requirement for utility SREC purchases (and this time with the governor signing the bill). The bill has other good provisions, like making residential power purchase agreements legal beyond the low-income market, and these will also help the industry. 
Virginia should also consider adopting a streamlined permitting protocol for onsite solar, as states like Florida have done. Some Virginia localities have already adopted automated permitting software, such as SolarAPP+, a free platform developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Permitting in some other localities, however, reportedly remains so arduous that it adds significantly to costs and delays in installing rooftop solar. 
Speaking of permitting, Virginia could pass a law like Utah’s to allow so-called balcony solar, plug-in solar panels that don’t require professional installation. The kits still require national certification before they can hit the market, however. 
Virginia could devote some emergency preparedness funds to onsite solar and storage at schools and senior centers to make local communities more resilient. These microgrids would save on energy costs for taxpayers and ensure people have a place to go that still has power when the larger grid is down. 
Utilities could once again be tasked with funding solar on low-income housing, as they did in response to Republican-sponsored legislation passed in 2019. Localities could be allowed to require solar panels on parking lots in some new developments, as provided in a bill the governor vetoed this spring. Legislation to increase goals and funding for solar on closed landfills, coal mines and other brownfields would also bring more solar to places where everyone agrees it is welcome. 
Finally, our Department of Energy has done a very good job supporting solar energy through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It could now be asked to convene meetings with the solar industry to plan a pathway to solar on more homes and businesses. They could start with a program of government-backed advertising and outreach to educate more consumers about the value of solar, its cost, and how to hire trustworthy installers. Customer acquisition is one of the biggest costs for solar companies, so reaching potential customers will reduce costs.   
Meanwhile, what can the average resident do? Talk to your elected leaders and candidates and get them to put in pro-solar bills and support the legislation you want to see. If Virginians want more home-grown clean energy,  we need to make it happen.

(U.S. Coast Guard photo) I once sat next to my Air Force three-star general boss in an otherwise empty auditorium in Montgomery, Alabama, listening to two junior officers rehearse a briefing on U.S. space security efforts. At the time, I was the Air War College resident civilian space expert. The two officers tag teaming on statements about U.S. defensive programs also spoke about offensive efforts aimed at particular countries. 
I leaned over and asked the general if we were at war with these countries. 
“Good question,” he whispered back.
“ARE WE AT WAR?” he then shouted out to the briefers.
One firmly answered yes.
The other said no. 
The general was understandably taken aback. “Seems like we ought to have that figured out before going on the offensive,” he replied. 
This happened nearly 30 years ago. But the general could very well make the same common sense statement today, relevant to three U.S. military attacks in the Caribbean that could trigger a war with Venezuela.
The first took place on Sept. 2 when the U.S. military carried out an airstrike against a civilian speedboat the Trump administration said was carrying drugs in international waters off Venezuela, killing 11 people. Then on Sept. 15, a strike on another boat killed three people. A third strike on Sept.19 killed three more people. In each instance, President Donald Trump stated the attacks were against narco-terrorists, members of the Tren de Aragua cartel, on their way to the United States. 
Rhode Island’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has spoken out against what he calls the illegality of the assaults, calling them “reckless, unauthorized operations” that could “drag our nation into a conflict we did not choose.” Reed pointed out that miscalculation on anyone’s part during or after the attacks could have triggered a war. California’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff further stated that “blowing up boats without any legal justification risks dragging the United States into another war and provoking unjustified hostilities against our own citizens.” 
Questions regarding the illegality of the attacks stem from both international and domestic law. International law allows attacks on a naval vessel in international waters during an armed conflict, which did not apply in this instance, and in peacetime if the vessel is suspected of engaging in terrorist activity, or posing a threat regarding weapons of mass destruction. 
Where drugs are involved, vessels are subject to seizure as part of law enforcement efforts. Using the U.S. military to blow up suspected drug trafficking vessels without any proof of who or what was aboard, offered either before or after the strikes, extends beyond allowable circumstances. 
The Trump Administration has justified the attacks as necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. Preventing and deterring drugs from reaching American shores has been and must continue to be a national imperative. But the U.S. drug crisis — and it is a crisis —  is not only or even primarily one of supply. The global market is lucrative, and dealers could and would go elsewhere were it not for high demand in the United States. Addressing the demand problem is also an issue worthy of immediate and holistic — though largely unattended — government action.
Domestically, questions have been raised regarding whether the attacks were a potential overreach of executive authority, both because the U.S. military was used as law enforcement and because Congress is authorized to take the nation into war, not the president. According to the U.S. War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 to check presidential ability to conduct military actions without Congressional consent during the Vietnam War, the president is required to consult with Congress before introducing the nation’s armed forces into hostilities. 










This happened nearly 30 years ago. But the general could very well make the same common sense statement today, relevant to three U.S. military attacks in the Caribbean that could trigger a war with Venezuela.


Congress was not involved in decision making prior to the attacks, nor provided much information or transparency regarding the rationale afterwards. After the first two attacks, Democratic Sens. Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced a joint resolution under the War Powers Act to block the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with certain nonstate actors without congressional authorization, to little avail. Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian with a long history of questioning executive overreach, has argued the U.S. can’t simply kill people suspected of wrongdoing without due process.
The recklessness of the actions raises the question of whether the Trump administration was deliberately trying to provoke a military response from Venezuela as an excuse for expanded U.S. military action. During Trump’s first term in office, tensions between the United States and Venezuela reached a point where he asked advisers about invasion as an option. He was strongly advised against it. Trump reportedly has said that invading Venezuela would be “cool.”  Then in March 2025, less restrained in muscle-flexing than during his first term, Trump issued an executive order levying a 25% tariff on countries that directly or indirectly imported Venezuelan oil.  
Oil. The United States has a history of getting into long wars with unanticipated and unintended consequences over oil. 
The number one customer for Venezuelan oil is China. Choking Venezuelan oil hurts China. The U.S. starting a war with Venezuela would have even further direct implications for China. China already voiced its support for Venezuela after the first two attacks, warning the U.S. against “bullying.” Like the renaming of the Defense Department to the Department of War, picking a fight with Venezuela seems at least in part another chest-thumping shot at China.
Starting a war for the administration to flex its political and military muscles would not be “cool” from any perspective because it puts American blood and treasure at risk. If we are not at war — and Congress has not authorized such — then these illegal, provocative, political-theater attacks must stop.

Fani Willis blew it.
Give her credit for this much: The Fulton County district attorney did have the guts, the courage and the ambition to attempt to bring Donald Trump to justice for his role in trying to overthrow the 2020 election here in Georgia. For all we know, Willis might also have had the evidence needed to convict him and his co-defendants, both in the eyes of a jury and in the eyes of the nation. 
But she never got the chance to present her case.
Why?
Because she blew it. Yes, she made a series of questionable calls, but she blew it by starting up a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to help her prosecute the case against Trump, and compounded it by stubbornly mishandling the subsequent scandal. In December, the Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified Willis as prosecutor in the case, ruling that the appearance of impropriety made it impossible for her to continue. Earlier this month, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected her appeal, ending Willis’ involvement and all but ending the case as well.
In fairness, those rulings come off less like reasoned legal opinions and more like attempts to make a controversial, politically awkward case go away. If so, it’s not an unreasonable tack to take. 
But again, Willis has only herself to blame for being in that position in the first place. A local district attorney who is attempting to prosecute a former (and future) president on politically charged crimes had better do everything by the book, showing good judgment throughout, to have a decent chance at success. Even defenders of Willis have a hard time making the case that she met that standard.
When she filed the case against Trump and 18 other alleged co-conspirators, Willis did so under the state RICO, or racketeering conspiracy case. That decision guaranteed that what followed would be a complicated, far-flung case in which a lot could go wrong, especially against top-flight defense counsel attracted by a rich defendant and a crime-of-the-century case. 
Indeed, in an unrelated RICO case involving the Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 co-defendants, Willis and her office did nothing to build confidence that they were capable of succeeding under such conditions. The Young Thug trial devolved into a carnival, the longest running trial in state history, and in the end most defendants went free after getting credit for time served.
Last November, Willis won re-election, in part because the Trump and Young Thug cases fell apart too late in the political calendar for major challengers to put a campaign together. She now has three-plus years to try to redeem her reputation and to hope that memories fade.
It’s also important to note that Willis launched her grand-jury investigation into Trump’s attempt to steal the election in February 2021, at a time when federal authorities were showing little stomach for doing so. It should not have been left to a local prosecutor to handle a case of such magnitude and consequence.
If she blew it, then Attorney General Merrick Garland and the federal Department of Justice blew it even worse.

More than 100 central Ohioans protested in front of the Columbus ABC affiliate WSYX ABC 6 in response to Sinclair Broadcast Group choosing not to air Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show after Disney reinstated it. 
Indivisible Central Ohio hosted a free speech protest Tuesday, in response to the Disney Company originally deciding to suspend Kimmel’s late-night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened ABC on a podcast. The threats came after Kimmel made comments about the murder of political activist Charlie Kirk on the show.
“The MAGA gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said during his show last week.

Disney announced Monday it was bringing Kimmel’s show back starting Tuesday night. 
“I am incredibly grateful that Jimmy Kimmel is going to be on television again,” Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer said at the protest. “But I am scared of how quickly Disney and ABC essentially said, ‘Oh, they’re coming after us. Oh, they’re things that we need from the government. We can’t push back. We can’t actually protect free speech.’ And that decision was really, really painful.”
The canceling of Kimmel’s show led to major backlash, with some people calling it limiting free speech and a violation of the First Amendment. 
“It was scary because this is not what democracy should look like,” Turcer said. “This is not what a functioning republic should look like. … If (President Donald Trump is) willing to go after talk show hosts, do you think they really want us speaking? No … We deserve free speech, and we need to protect it.” 
However, not every ABC station is airing Kimmel’s late-night show.

Sinclair — which owns the Dayton and Columbus ABC affiliate stations — is not broadcasting Kimmel’s show. Instead, those ABC affiliates are preempting the show and airing news programming during the time slot, according to The New York Times. Nexstar said it is pre-empting Kimmel’s show indefinitely. 
“Mr. Kimmel’s remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said last week in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities.”
Sinclair is calling on Kimmel to issue an apology to the Kirk family and make a “meaningful personal donation” to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA. 
“We can all see something that’s funny, hear something that’s funny, and it makes us think more deeply,” Turcer said. “This was an attack on our ability to actually think and work through things, and an opportunity, not just for Jimmy Kimmel to have a voice, but for all of us to have a voice now.”
This is bigger than Kimmel, ABC, and Sinclair, said Gary Daniels, ACLU of Ohio’s legislative director. 
“Free speech does not protect itself,” he said at the protest. “People protect free speech. You protect free speech.”

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation)States are scrambling for the money to fill potholes, plow roads, maintain bridges and pay bus drivers as they confront inflation- and tariff-driven cost increases and declining gas tax revenues. 
States also face uncertain federal funding as the Trump administration reduces the size of government and zeroes out some Biden-era transportation programs. As the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires next year and Congress considers its next transportation funding bill, cities are clamoring for the federal government to bypass states and give cities a larger share of federal infrastructure money distributed by formula. 
Drivers will have to pay higher vehicle registration fees and gas taxes to make up for the shortfalls. Long-planned construction projects and safety improvements will be delayed. And bus riders may see fewer routes and longer wait times.
The chaos in a pair of state legislatures on either side of the country illustrates the dire state of highways and transit systems – and might foretell a bumpy road ahead.
Deep cuts to bus and rail services loom across big cities, small towns

In Oregon, nearly 500 transportation employees, about 10% of the department’s workforce, might lose their jobs as state lawmakers consider a transportation funding bill in a special legislative session. The political balance is so delicate that lawmakers have delayed a vote on a $4.3 billion transportation package for more than two weeks while a Democratic state senator recovers from surgery; his vote is necessary to pass the funding measure, a tax increase that requires a supermajority. The Senate is now expected to vote on Sept. 29. 
And in Pennsylvania, a budget impasse over transit funding between the state’s Republican-dominated Senate and Democrat-led House continues. Philadelphia’s transit system, SEPTA, has said it will reverse deep cuts that threatened a near-shutdown of the  buses and trains in one of the country’s largest transit systems. 
The move, approved by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, allows the transit agency to shift $394 million from capital funding to operational expenses for the next two years. 
Shapiro said he acted after he learned there was a 63% increase in late arrivals to Philadelphia schools when the service cuts began, according to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. 
“It was just clear to me that is not something we can allow to continue,” Shapiro said at a news conference.  
Pandemic-era funding ends
Pennsylvania and other states are confronting the end of pandemic-era federal funding that kept transit systems afloat. The so-called fiscal cliff threatens to bring about fare hikes and service cuts to bus and rail systems in both big cities and rural America in the coming years. To address the shortfalls, many states are, like SEPTA, shifting money that was earmarked for capital investment toward operating expenses.  
“It’s financial gymnastics,” said Joe Kane, a fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who studies transportation issues. “We fundamentally as a country have a challenge in reliably and durably having a revenue source to pay for these improvements across the country. It’s put even more pressure on states and localities to cobble together the resources — however and wherever they can — to make up for some of those gaps.”
The funding crisis has been particularly drastic for the country’s transit systems, said Corrigan Salerno, a policy manager at Transportation for America, an advocacy organization for safe transit. Ridership hasn’t fully recovered from pandemic-era declines, he said, meaning that transit agencies aren’t collecting as many fares as they did before 2020. The cost of labor, parts, software and fuel to maintain and operate transit systems has exceeded inflation, too. 










We fundamentally as a country have a challenge in reliably and durably having a revenue source to pay for these improvements across the country. 


– Joe Kane, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies transportation issues


Without high-quality or frequent-enough service, buses and trains are unable to attract riders, he said. Service cuts and fare hikes can make the system less attractive to riders, as well as bring in less money from riders. 
“And that’s really the nature of the fiscal cliff and the death spiral that transit agencies are really trying so desperately to avoid,” Salerno said. “Because once they have to make these service cuts to square their budgets, people are going to stop riding some of these systems.” 
Chicago; San Francisco; Seattle; Tucson, Arizona, and the state of Rhode Island have all faced transit funding gaps in recent months, Salerno said. In North Carolina, voters will consider a ballot measure in November to increase a local sales tax to support transit and road improvements in Charlotte, the state’s biggest city. In California, local transit agencies are seeking temporary operating loans from the state. 
Eliminating bus routes
In Oregon, lawmakers have been at work on a transportation bill for several years, but the funding crisis came to a head after the legislature failed to pass a new spending plan before the end of the regular legislative session in June. 
The state’s Department of Transportation faced an immediate $300 million shortfall in the two-year budget cycle that began July 1. The transit agency for the Portland area, Tri-Met, announced it would eliminate up to eight bus lines as well as reduce the frequency of service on other lines as soon as November. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, announced this summer that the state would lay off 483 transportation workers and close a dozen maintenance facilities. Among those who may lose their jobs are programmers who maintain software for Driver & Motor Vehicle Services, and maintenance workers who stripe roads, clear brush, and clean up graffiti and debris. 
Kotek pushed back the layoffs after House lawmakers passed a new funding plan during a special session that began in September. But if the Senate fails to approve the measure, the layoffs are scheduled for Oct. 15. 
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The transportation package would raise the state gas tax by six cents a gallon, increase vehicle title and registration fees, and temporarily double a statewide payroll tax for transit from 0.1% to 0.2%, according to the Oregon Capital Chronicle. 
The legislation would allow the payroll tax to sunset in 2028, a move that critics warn will force the state, once again, to confront how to avoid cuts to bus service. It also requires electric vehicle drivers to pay a mileage fee to support road maintenance, a move that could dampen EV sales, but that captures some of the gas tax revenue lost to the transition to electric cars.  
Without new funding in Oregon, local road departments will continue to face impossible choices that lead to reduced services and delayed implementation of safety projects, said Lamar Wise, the political director for Oregon AFSCME, the union representing 850 road workers, engineers and surveyors in the state. Failure to increase taxes and fees means asking fewer workers “to do more with less,” putting their safety and the driving public at risk, Wise told a legislative committee in August, as it considered the transportation package.  
“It is about keeping our roads safe and ensuring that the public can count on reliable transportation in every corner of the state,” Wise said. 
In Portland, the state’s largest city, it’s impossible to absorb more cuts to service, Mayor Keith Wilson told the same panel. If lawmakers don’t pass a spending plan, the city will likely lose 50 transportation staffers who repair streetlights, upgrade traffic signals and manage construction projects. The city bureau has faced cuts each of the past seven years, Wilson said. 
“If you drive down the streets of Portland, or ride on a bus or a bike, the roads under your tires are crumbling,” he said.
But Jake Seavert, a county commissioner in Union County, a rural county of 26,000 in Eastern  Oregon, told lawmakers that his constituents object to the spending plan, particularly the increase in fuel taxes and registration fees. The hike in annual registration fees places an undue burden on businesses and rural families who require multiple vehicles, he testified. 
Oregon’s Department of Transportation must look for efficiencies, Seavert said, a nod to the Trump administration’s lacerating cuts to federal jobs and spending. 
“Do more with less,” Seavert said.

Jeanne Shaheen (left) and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin speak at a press conference on Sept. 16, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A tax credit used by almost 50,000 in New Hampshire to pay for their health care through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace is set to expire at the end of the year. But congressional Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, have made preserving those credits a key priority amid the spending fight to keep the government open.
“We need to ensure that people can continue to get their health insurance,” Shaheen said in a phone interview with the Bulletin. “It’s important for the workforce. It’s important for our employers.”
If and when the tax credit expires, premiums for those using them could spike dramatically. In New Hampshire, 49,757 people have used the tax credit in 2025, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If the credits expire, a single person in their mid-40s earning $31,300 in New Hampshire annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344, according to analysis from New Futures, a New Hampshire-based health policy advocacy group, and Families USA, a national health policy advocacy group. A couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually could see their premiums increase $14,712, per the same analysis.
The history of the tax credits
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act created the ACA Marketplace, where people from all 50 states could purchase health care coverage. Within that marketplace, people could receive tax credits to subsidize their health care. However, over the years, as the cost of living increased, particularly in states like New Hampshire, lawmakers felt this baseline premium tax credit was no longer sufficient to help people afford coverage.
In 2019, a group of congressional Democrats proposed the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, essentially an increased credit that covers a larger portion of the cost of health coverage and expands eligibility. Shaheen introduced the legislation in the Senate.
In 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which incorporated provisions from Shaheen’s bill to create the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits. However, the bill made the credits temporary until the end of 2022. That year, the credits were extended to the end of 2025 through the Inflation Reduction Act. Unless Congress acts, the increased tax credits will expire at the end of December.
The fight today
In January, Shaheen and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, introduced the Health Care Affordability Act, which if enacted would make the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits permanent. The two senators have tried unsuccessfully to pass the legislation in previous years. This year, the bill has not yet made it out of committee roughly nine months after being introduced.
Meanwhile, Shaheen and Baldwin are working to elevate the issue as Congress debates a stopgap spending plan. If Congress doesn’t come up with a spending plan by Sept. 30, it risks a shutdown of the federal government. Republicans have proposed a plan to keep the government open through Nov. 21 using mostly current levels of federal spending as well as an additional roughly $88 million to increase security for government officials in the wake of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s assassination. However, Democrats, including Shaheen, proposed an alternative that would fund the government through Oct. 31 and spend an additional roughly $1 trillion to extend the increased tax credits and reverse some of the cuts Republicans made to Medicaid and other health programs when they passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July.
Neither party has accepted the other’s proposal.
Shaheen told the Bulletin she hopes the threat of a looming shutdown “means there will be incentive for people to sit down and work together and figure out how we can get this done.”
“I think it’s important to keep the government open, and I also think it’s important to ensure that people don’t lose their health care,” she said. “So I think there are lots of ways to do this, but what we need to do is to work together, get everybody at the table and say, ‘These are two challenges that we have. How can we work together to get this done?’”
She argued her constituents want Democrats and Republicans to work together rather than have Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, operate without Democrats’ input.
“That’s what I hear from people in New Hampshire, that they want us to work together,” Shaheen said. “They want us to address the issues facing the country. And this is a perfect example of being able to sit down together and do that. It’s not helpful to have President Trump say to the Republican majorities in the House and Senate, ‘You shouldn’t even talk to Democrats.’ That’s not what people in this country want. It’s in everybody’s interest to work together to address the problems we face.”
Shaheen said she’s open to trying to get the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits extended or made permanent through means other than in a spending plan. While she would like to see them made permanent, she said it’s “negotiable” and would support another temporary extension.
Republicans aren’t completely opposed
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, expressed openness to extending the increased tax credits, but ruled out doing so as part of legislation to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown.
“I think that we are open to the conversation about what we do with the Obamacare premium tax credits,” Thune told reporters last week. “That’s something in which members, Republican senators and I think, for that matter, Republican House members, have an interest as well, but this isn’t the place to do that.”
Shaheen said she’s had conversations with Republican colleagues who see a need to extend the credits as well.
“More and more they’re understanding that this is going to have a huge impact on their constituents,” she said. “We’ve heard from two of President Trump’s pollsters who have said if the Republicans don’t get this done, they’re going to pay for it at the ballot box.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shaheenbaldwin-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 05:57:32.357310

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Arkansas’ electric utilities scored poorly on the Sierra Club’s annual report on the transition away from fossil fuels, which was released earlier this week.
Some utilities, the report said, aren’t planning to build any green power at all.
Three Arkansas electric utilities were graded in the Sierra Club’s fifth annual “Dirty Truth” report — Entergy Arkansas, SWEPCO and Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. With the exception of Entergy, which was given a “C” grade, both SWEPCO and the cooperative were given an “F” by the report authors, who cited the energy firms’ trailing adoption of renewable energy sources.
The report evaluated 75 electric utilities nationwide on three criteria: efforts to retire coal plants by 2030, to not build new gas plants through 2035 and to build clean energy through 2035. The 2025 report notes that most utilities it evaluated have “failed to plan for the clean energy transition” since it first began grading in 2021.
The average score of the graded utilities was an “F” this year — a drop from consistent “D” grades in the first four years of the report. While 65% of graded utilities have improved the clean energy component of their ranking since 2021, overall, 51% have seen their overall score worsen since the 2021 report due to many also “doubling down on fossil fuels.”
“This year, the U.S. faces dual pressures: a shift in federal support away from clean energy due to the effective elimination of much of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and a surge in projected electricity demand, also known as load growth,” the report says.
Despite these pressures, the report says it is imperative that utilities still transition away from fossil fuels by 2035, as “the window of opportunity to create and implement cost-effective plans is closing.”
Entergy’s score, which dropped considerably compared to its “A” on last year’s report, was in large part due to the impending shutdown of two coal plants in the coming years and its plans for additional solar and wind generation, the report said. The Sierra Club said the utility could score better “if it’d focus on renewables more than expensive gas generation to address future load growth.”
Entergy announced in July plans to build a 754-megawatt natural gas-fired generating plant near its White Bluff coal-fired power plant in Jefferson County, which is scheduled to stop burning coal in 2028.
In response to a request for comment on the Sierra Club report, Entergy Arkansas spokesperson Matt Ramsey said the utility “is maintaining our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.”
The Sierra Club criticized the utilities it ranked for not moving faster to adopt cleaner alternatives to coal, especially as increases to the cost of electricity outstrip overall inflation. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity bills in the South increased 6.7% in the 12-month period ending in August. The region’s overall inflation rate over the same span was 2.6%.
The Sierra Club called out Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. specifically for having “one of the lowest renewables scores in the entire United States,” with the club saying this was due to AECC not having any planned solar or wind power despite projected increases in demand.
An AECC spokesperson said the cooperatives use a “balance of power approach” in order to provide customers with reliable power, and criticized the Sierra Club’s efforts to “prematurely” shut down the coal plants.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/25/ct-unions-break-talks-lamont-past-due-raises/,"State employee unions continue to spar with CT Gov. Ned Lamont over raises, with two more bargaining units breaking off talks late Wednesday.","State employee unions continue to spar with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration over past-due raises, with two more bargaining units breaking off talks late Wednesday with the executive branch.
Correction officer supervisors and education professionals both declared impasses, bringing to six the number of units that now can seek arbitration over wages and working conditions.
“Governor Lamont doesn’t know what it’s like to work inside these facilities every day — and his latest offer makes that clear,” said Lt. Thomas Titus, president of the Correction Supervisors’ Council.
Titus didn’t disclose specifics of wage or other proposals but added, “we won’t accept a lowball offer. Our members have earned fair pay and we’re going to keep fighting for it.”
Union leaders have said the Department of Correction is dangerously understaffed and employees often are pressed into excessive, mandatory overtime.
The department accounted for $118.8 million or 38% of state agency overtime spending last fiscal year, according to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
Jennifer Corti, president of the unit representing education professionals in five state agencies, said workers likely will be stretched thinner in the coming years as Connecticut grapples with huge cuts in federal assistance.
“Our members, and the people we serve every day, deserve to know that Governor Lamont is serious about protecting Connecticut from the fallout of federal chaos,” Corti said. “So given the stakes, and the lack of progress at the table, declaring impasse and moving toward arbitration is now the only responsible option.”
The governor has countered repeatedly that state employees have received raises every year since he took office in January 2019, and that would continue under the new agreements.
“There shouldn’t be any confusion” among workers about the administration’s desire to award raises, Lamont said shortly after four unions broke off talks in mid-July. “They know we have well over $100 million earmarked in this budget. They know that we’ve said, ‘You’re going to get a raise.’”
Lamont, a Democrat, has been accused by Republican legislators and conservative groups of being too generous with state employee compensation.
During the past four fiscal years, all unions have received annual cost-of-living raises of 2.5%. And all but the most senior workers remain eligible for a yearly step hike as well, which reflects increased experience and typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise.
Thirty-five bargaining units, which represent the overwhelming bulk of state government’s 40,000-plus workforce have been negotiating new wage hikes since January. And they’ve been working under expired contracts since July 1.
The lone exception is the state police troopers’ union. Lamont negotiated a 2.5% cost-of-living hike plus a step raise for that group last spring, and legislators ratified the deal in mid-May.
The governor, who is expected to seek a third term in office next year, has been at odds with most of his labor base this year, despite assurances that raises are forthcoming.
The union representing 1,300 probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other judicial branch support staff announced July 2 it would seek arbitration.
Six days later, two more bargaining units, representing judicial marshals and their immediate supervisors, also ended talks. In all three instances, labor officials charged the administration was offering $2,000 one-time payments in lieu of ongoing raises. The governor’s office countered there had been a misunderstanding and that ongoing raises were on the table.
Still, a fourth bargaining unit, representing rank-and-file correction officers, declared an impasse on July 16.
Contract negotiations typically address work conditions and other issues besides compensation. And though neither side has discussed negotiations in this area, talks were expected to include one particularly sticky point: working from home.
The governor and many Republican legislators in recent years have expressed increasing concerns over remote-work rules, which were established shortly after COVID struck Connecticut in spring 2020. Unions have been reluctant to alter those work-from-home rules, arguing they have helped many workers become more productive.
Union leaders and the fiscally moderate governor don’t see eye-to-eye over controversial budget caps that have generated unprecedented surpluses in recent years. Connecticut has used those caps, which Lamont strongly supports, to generate an extra $8.5 billion to reduce its pension debt. Labor officials, and many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature, counter Connecticut is saving too aggressively for its pensions, leeching needed dollars away from education, health care and other core services.
And tensions between the governor and some unions also have been heightened recently by Lamont’s interest in investing state pension assets in the Connecticut Sun to keep the WNBA franchise in the state.
Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the single-largest union in state government, representing more than 14,000 workers, released a statement last week urging Lamont to suspend that effort and focus on wage negotiations.
“State employees have been without a contract since July,” Jody Barr, Council 4’s executive director, said Wednesday, adding that the two sides have been negotiating wage and working conditions since January. “They think that this governor’s focus should be at the table negotiating for his employees.”
The Connecticut Police and Fire Union joined that debate late Tuesday, also urging Lamont to put basketball on the backburner.
“Enough is enough Governor Lamont,” the union wrote in a statement posted to its website. “Return to the table with us. Finish our contract, give our members the confidence their future will be secured, and let’s stop losing our people to municipalities and career changes. Until all our members can feel protected by their contract and retirement agreements, any discussion about investing our pension funds should be ceased.”
The union represents about 950 police, fire and other public safety personnel who protect state colleges and universities, office buildings, mental health facilities, airports and parks. It’s members also include Department of Motor Vehicles testing officers and state liquor control agents. The union does not include state police troopers.
But the governor said earlier this week that Council 4’s objections weren’t giving him pause.
“No, I think their concerns were probably more about a contract than the Connecticut Sun,” he said. “But more importantly, it’s a good investment, and I can tell you that the treasurer wouldn’t do a deal regarding the Connecticut Sun if it wasn’t a good investment.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Despite Ohio only having one candidate per party receiving widespread support, many decisions still need to be made ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Ohio Republicans continue to rally behind their candidate for governor.
“It’s now Ohio’s turn to lead the way,” Ramaswamy said during an event he hosted with U.S. Senator Jon Husted in Columbus on Monday evening.
More than a year before the Nov. 2026 election, and months before the primary, Ramaswamy has continued clearing the path as he tries to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine.
Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, who previously expressed interest in running for governor, bowed out Friday.
“I believe that our crucial opportunities in the areas of education and workforce deserve my full attention for the remainder of our term,” Tressel wrote on social media.
That leaves Ramaswamy as the only candidate in the Republican primary race with widespread support. Now, he has laid out his priorities, which include making Ohio more attractive to people, eliminating the income tax, and promoting economic and educational development.
“It is a top goal for me to make sure that our young people actually remain in this state rather than moving out to pursue opportunity elsewhere,” Ramaswamy said.
On the Democratic side, COVID-era health director Dr. Amy Acton remains the most prominent party candidate in the race.
“I will always be focused on Ohioans and whatever it takes to move them forward and solve the issues that affect their everyday lives,” she said in an interview with WEWS last month.
But former Congressman Tim Ryan has been floating a run for governor, with his team saying he would decide by the end of September.
“I am not one for hypotheticals,” Acton said when asked about Ryan. “We’re very, very excited by how we’ve been received, certainly, setting records for any Democratic candidate.”
While the Democrats figure out their candidate, the next step for Ramaswamy is to choose his second-in-command. He left an event on Monday without taking questions from reporters, but he’s previously told us he will be working with the legislature on all of his policy ideas.
“That’s the type of leadership we need to build upon the foundation that we’ve already set in this state to make us not just the best in the Midwest, but the best in the entire country,” Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) said after the event.
Strategists have continued to suggest McColley could be Ramaswamy’s running mate because he can navigate the lawmakers.
McColley said the decision was up to Ramaswamy when asked whether the Senate President would be the best fit, given his role in leadership.
“My enthusiasm is behind him no matter what as a candidate, because he has the ability to have that bold, transformative leadership that’s going to take this state to the next level,” McColley said.
The only other names consistently mentioned by strategists are Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, state Sen. Kristina Roegner (R-Hudson), and former state Rep. Jay Edwards. Sprague is running for secretary of state, LaRose is running for auditor, and both Roegner and Edwards are running for treasurer.
Of the five, McColley was the only one to attend the event on Monday. The others were asked what their priorities would be as lieutenant governor and if they had been communicating with Ramaswamy’s team.
Sprague’s team declined to answer questions but said he had a scheduling conflict. Neither LaRose nor Edwards replied.
“I am honored that my name has been mentioned,” Roegner said. “I have great confidence in Vivek’s leadership and look forward to his governorship. While speculation may continue, my full commitment right now is to winning the Treasurer of State office.”
Although he hasn’t announced that he is running for another position due to being term-limited in the Senate, McColley could potentially run for Congress, as strategists from D.C. have said he is being courted to run for District 9 against longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.
McColley was asked by WEWS on Monday about the potential to face Marcy Kaptur.
“You love asking speculative questions that are based off of rumors and innuendo and everything like that,” he said, smiling. “I suppose it’s your job to do that, but I don’t really have any comment on any of that. I, at this point, have kind of told people, ‘Look, I’ve got to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.’”
The president continued that he is evaluating all options.
“I don’t know what that’s going to be,” McColley said. “I might just go back and be a lawyer in Northwest Ohio. We’ll see what it looks like, but it’s just been a pleasure to serve in the Ohio Senate as president, and we’ll see what the future holds.”
Gubernatorial teams need to be announced by February.
Other candidates who have started campaigning for governor include Republican Philip Funderburg, Democrat Jacob Chiara, and independent Tim Grady. Heather Hill had previously announced she would run as a Republican, but later stated she would run as either a Libertarian, an independent, or a member of Elon Musk’s America Party — a party that is not yet recognized in Ohio.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Imagine a protest outside the funeral of a popular political leader, with some of the protesters celebrating the death and holding signs that say things like “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” and “Don’t Pray for the USA.”

No matter the political leanings of that leader, most Americans would probably abhor such a protest and those signs.
What would tolerate such activities, no matter how distasteful? The First Amendment.
The situation described above is taken from an actual protest, though it did not involve the funeral of a political figure. Instead, members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested outside the funeral of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, a U.S. service member killed in Iraq.
Through demonstrations like this, members of this group were conveying their belief that the U.S. is overly tolerant of those they perceive as sinners, especially people from the LGBTQ community, and that the death of U.S. soldiers should be recognized as divine retribution for such sinfulness.
Snyder’s family sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. A jury issued a $5 million jury award in favor of the family of the deceased service member. But in a nearly unanimous decision issued in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the First Amendment insulated the protesters from such a judgment.
This holding is particularly instructive today.
The Trump administration has vowed to crack down on what it calls hate speech. It has labeled antifa, a loosely organized anti-fascist group, a terrorist organization. And it has sought to punish figures such as TV host Jimmy Kimmel for statements perceived critical of conservative activists.
What the First Amendment makes clear is that it does not just protect the rights of speakers who say things with which Americans agree. Or, as the Supreme Court said in a separate decision it issued one year after the case involving the funeral protesters: “The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace.”
But free speech is not absolute. As a legal scholar who has studied political movements, free speech and privacy, I realize the government can regulate speech through what are known as “reasonable time, place, and manner” restrictions. These limits cannot depend upon the content of the speech or expressive conduct in which a speaker is engaged, however.
For example, the government can ban campfires in an area prone to wildfires. But if it banned the burning of the U.S. flag only as a form of political protest, that would be an unconstitutional restriction on speech.
Protected and unprotected speech
There are certain categories of speech that are not entitled to First Amendment protection. They include incitement to violence, obscenity, defamation, and what are considered “true threats.”
When, for example, someone posts threats on social media with reckless disregard for whether they will instill legitimate fear in their target, such posts are not a protected form of speech. Similarly, burning a cross on someone’s property as a means of striking terror in them such that they fear bodily harm also represents this kind of true threat.
There are also violations of the law that are sometimes prosecuted as “hate crimes,” criminal acts driven by some discriminatory motive. In these cases, it’s generally not the perpetrator’s beliefs that are punished but the fact that they act on them and engage in some other form of criminal conduct, as when someone physically assaults their victim based on that victim’s race or religion. Such motives can increase the punishment people receive for the underlying criminal conduct.
Speech that enjoys the strongest free-speech protections is that which is critical of government policies and leaders. As the Supreme Court said in 1966, “There is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of (the First) Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.”
As the late Justice Antonin Scalia would explain in 2003, “The right to criticize the government” is at “the heart of what the First Amendment is meant to protect.”
Restrictions on government action
The First Amendment prevents the government from taking direct action to curtail speech by, for example, trying to prevent the publication of material critical of it. Americans witnessed this in the Pentagon Papers case, where the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not prevent newspapers from publishing a leaked – and politically damaging – study on U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
But it also applies when the government acts in indirect ways, such as threatening to investigate a media company or cutting funding for a university based on politically disfavored action or inaction.
In 2024 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the state of New York’s efforts to punish companies that did business with the National Rifle Association because of the organization’s political positions violated the group’s First Amendment rights.
Similarly, in recent months, courts have ruled on First Amendment grounds against Trump administration efforts to punish law firms or to withhold funds from Harvard University.
And just last week, a federal court in Florida threw out a lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times seeking $15 billion for alleged harm to the president’s investments and reputation.
Nevertheless, some people fear government retribution for criticizing the administration. And some, like the TV network ABC, have engaged in speech-restricting action on their own, such as taking Kimmel temporarily off the air for his comments critical of conservative activists in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing.
Before Kimmel’s suspension, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr described his negotiations with ABC’s parent company, Disney, to take action against him. “We could do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. And Trump said that some media companies might “lose their license” for criticizing the president. It is encouraging that, in the face of these threats, ABC has reversed course and agreed to put Kimmel back on the air.
The First Amendment protects speech across the political spectrum, even speech Americans do not like. Both liberal comedian Jon Stewart and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson have recently agreed on this. As Carlson said recently, “If they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think. … There is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”
Just last year in the NRA case referenced above, the Supreme Court clearly stated that even indirect government efforts to curtail protected speech are indeed unconstitutional. In light of that ruling, efforts to limit criticism of the administration, any administration, should give all Americans, regardless of their political views, great pause.

They made the changes with two provisions — one, a so-called ‘piggyback’ homestead exemption, and the other, a nearly 1 mill (or 0.1%) rollback of the county’s inside millage.
The move comes as Ohio lawmakers wrangle over several proposals to rein in property taxes, and a property tax working group set up by Gov. Mike DeWine finalizes its set of proposed fixes. Lawmakers still haven’t given up on overriding the governor’s property tax vetoes from the budget. All the while, organizers continue collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment repealing property taxes.
Commission President Don Dixon said Ohio’s property taxes are a mess, and it’s state lawmakers’ job to clean it up.
“Commissioners have no legislative authority. We can only do what the Ohio Revised Code says we can do,” Dixon said. “The responsibility to fix it, clearly, is only in the hands of the state legislature.”

The county’s changes
In a press release, Butler County officials said they’ve returned roughly $50 million to homeowners through their most recent rollback, and two previous reductions in 2022 and 2024.
The piggyback homestead exemption will give seniors and permanently disabled homeowners in Butler County a little more breathing room. The standard statewide homestead exemption shields the first $28,000 of a homeowner’s appraised value from taxation. The county’s piggyback exemption effectively doubles that protection.
“We felt that the homestead reduction would help seniors and those, you know, on the edge,” Commissioner Cindy Carpenter said. “That additional, whatever the amount is, $100, $200 a year, makes a big difference to some people.”
The county’s inside millage cut brings their rate down from 1.92 mills to 1 mill for taxes they’ll collect next year. For a hypothetical home with a taxable value of $100,000, that reduction would take their tax bill from $192 to $100. The rollback will only be in place for one year, reducing the amount of property tax revenue the county collects in 2026.
Commissioner T.C. Rogers said he hopes the proposals demonstrate to Butler County residents that, “we hear you, we work for you and we give back to you.”
“Even a drunken sailor”
Dixon argued the changes were necessary because the county, like many others in Ohio, is buckling under the pressure of rising home values. Following its most recent triennial update, Butler County’s median home value rose by 37%.
“I mean, even a drunken sailor would be able to realize that these numbers are just astronomical,” Dixon said. “And no one, even if you had your own printing press, could keep up.”
In an email, County Auditor Nancy Nix warned those increases weren’t a one-time thing. Her office has been working all year on the upcoming 2026 re-valuation, which will impact tax bills in 2027. She expects values to climb another 13% to 25%, which could translate to tax increases of as much as 15%.
Dixon expressed frustration that lawmakers balked at overriding DeWine’s vetoes over the summer. Instead of overriding three provisions, the House voted on one. The Senate hasn’t weighed in yet.
“There’s a process to override that veto. It takes 60%, and I’ll be damned, they couldn’t even get 60% to support their own legislation,” he said. “So, if you don’t think that’s a mess, I don’t know what a mess is.”
Dixon promised to lead a group from Butler County up to the state capitol “to show those folks that look, you just can’t pat us on the back and tell us thanks for coming and do nothing.”
Dixon also said county leaders “have a card to play” at the ballot box. While organizers gather signatures to repeal property taxes, he threatened to start collecting signatures for an amendment of his own. He didn’t share specifics but suggested there should be “guardrails” to limit tax increases.
“One way or another, we’re going to have to fix this,” Dixon said. “We’re not going to sit here and take it quietly. We’ve played by the rules, went through all the proper procedures and got lied to, and lied to, and lied to, and now it’s time we take a stand and this is it.”

Small solar-panel kits that can be assembled as easily as an Ikea bookcase and plugged into a regular residential outlet could be coming soon to New Hampshire and Vermont. Lawmakers and advocates in both states are preparing legislation that would make these plug-in solar systems accessible to residents who don’t have the space, money, or inclination to install a larger, conventional rooftop array.


“It’s really about energy affordability,” said Kevin Chou, cofounder of Bright Saver, a nonprofit that advocates for the adoption of plug-in solar. ​“It’s about access for people who wanted solar but haven’t been able to get it.”


These systems — also called ​“portable” or ​“balcony” solar — generally come in kits that even a novice can put together at home. They plug into a standard outlet, sending the power they generate into a home’s wires, rather than drawing electricity out.


Unlike rooftop arrays, plug-in systems don’t generate enough power to meet all, or even most, of a household’s needs, but they offset enough consumption to pay for themselves within four or five years, even without incentives like tax credits or net metering, Chou said. Models now on the market start at about $2,000. If the equipment becomes more popular and prices come down, the payback period could get even shorter.


“You don’t need any subsidies to make this work,” Chou said. ​“The pure economics are so attractive, it’s one of the best investments you can make.”


These systems have taken off in Germany, where more than a million have been deployed, but have been much slower to catch on in the United States.


Recently, though, the idea has gained traction in the U.S. In March, Utah lawmakers, working with Bright Saver, unanimously passed a law authorizing and regulating the equipment, making it the first state to lay out the welcome mat for plug-in solar. Last month, a Pennsylvania state representative announced plans to introduce a similar law, and Bright Saver is having conversations with lawmakers in about a dozen additional states about possible legislation, Chou said.


All of the legislative proposals follow the same principles as Utah’s law: They would define a new class of small, portable solar systems, and establish the right of households to use the systems without submitting applications or paying fees to the state or utilities. They also define safety standards for the systems, including that they be certified by Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, a company that sets standards and provides safety certifications for a wide range of products.


At the moment, two manufacturers make plug-in solar systems with inverters that have been certified as complying with safety requirements, Chou said. Because the market for portable solar is so new, however, UL has not developed standards for entire systems. Bright Saver and other plug-in solar supporters have been working with the company on this issue and expect a standard to be released in the next month or two, Chou said.


Other startups are waiting in the wings, hoping to launch their own products next year, once the questions about UL standards are resolved, he added.


“Bottom line: Once Vermont’s legislation passes, there will be existing manufacturers ready to sell into the state immediately, along with new entrants waiting for additional UL clarity, who are also preparing to launch,” Chou said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BrightSaver_2025-09-22-201755_lznz.jpg.webp,,,2025-09-25 04:56:46.357722

(Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for National Women's Law Center)Most Americans assume that schools are legally required to protect students from sexual harassment and assault under Title IX — the federal law enacted in 1972 that bans sexual discrimination in education.
I am a law professor and researcher who has spent more than a decade examining the disconnect between what Title IX promises on paper and what students expect it to deliver in practice. What’s happening now isn’t just another policy shift — it’s a dismantling of protections many assume still exist.
 
Title IX’s 37 words
The main text of Title IX is just 37 words and reads: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
This legal text doesn’t define sex or discrimination, or explain what kinds of behavior the act covers. For decades, the Department of Education filled in those gaps by writing detailed rules, providing guidance to schools and investigating when schools failed to comply.
In 2020, the Trump administration adopted much narrower rules. Colleges and universities have to act only when top officials — such as deans or Title IX coordinators — receive a report, and even then, their responses only have to avoid being “clearly unreasonable.”
In 2024, the Biden administration tried to widen those protections by requiring schools to step in whenever employees other than doctors and therapists learned of possible harassment, and to do so promptly and effectively. But in January 2025, a federal court blocked those rules before they could take effect.
Today those less protective 2020 rules remain in place, and the agency responsible for enforcing them is being dismantled.
In March 2025, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Education to close. Legally, an executive order cannot abolish the department outright. That would require an act of Congress.
But the order has still reshaped the agency in practice by cutting staff and shuttering offices. The Office for Civil Rights, which handles Title IX and other discrimination complaints in schools, was especially hard hit. About 260 employees were laid off, and seven of its 12 regional offices were closed, even though more than 6,000 investigations were unresolved as of January.
A federal judge has since ordered those employees to be reinstated, with staff scheduled to return in phases through November 2025. It is not clear how these and other changes are going to affect how the office functions.
 
A system under strain
Beyond the headlines about layoffs, the deeper question is what happens when students turn to Title IX for protection.
The Heritage Foundation’s long-term vision provides a clue: Project 2025 proposes to move the Office of Civil Rights into the Department of Justice and limit its role to litigation of intentional discrimination cases.
While Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, his Cabinet includes authors of this policy blueprint. And in less than a year, the administration has moved forward with nearly half of Project 2025’s goals, including over 40% of the policies aimed at the Department of Education.
If the Department of Education can no longer resolve discrimination complaints within the agency, students will be left to pursue their claims directly in federal court. But the numbers show why that path cannot absorb the caseload.
In 2024, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights received 22,687 discrimination complaints, including nearly 12,000 related to Title IX. By comparison, federal courts in 2024 nationwide heard fewer than 1,000 education-related civil rights cases.
Federal courts are understaffed, and even if federal judges had the capacity to absorb 20 times more cases, most students simply cannot afford that path. Lawsuits demand lawyers, months of preparation and often years before any resolution.
The Office for Civil Rights offers something fundamentally different from going to court. It provides low-cost investigations, mediation that could resolve cases in weeks instead of years. Its settlements address not just individual harm but institutional failures.
Some cases drag on, but students do not need lawyers, and the OCR often secures broader reforms through negotiated settlements — from campuswide training programs to complete overhauls of complaint procedures.
The office also published policy guidance and answered more than 11,000 public inquiries in 2024, providing clarity for schools and students alike. These tools didn’t eliminate the backlog, but they showed that the OCR could deliver meaningful results without the cost and delay of court.
But this system is exactly what’s at risk if Project 2025’s vision becomes reality. If the OCR loses its authority to resolve complaints, students will lose the only clear path to quick, affordable results and reliable information.
 
What this means for students
For schools and their students, that shift away from federal agencies would be dramatic. It would mean no more negotiated agreements, no more policy guidance, and no administrative investigations into systemic issues. Courts would decide what Title IX means, forcing students to file expensive lawsuits that drag on for years and require much stronger evidence of discrimination than the Office of Civil Rights ever demanded.
The administration has offered an alternative: “return our students to the states,” as President Donald Trump put it on March 20, 2025, when he signed the executive order outlining his plan to close the Department of Education.
But states cannot fill the enforcement gap left by eliminating the Office for Civil Rights’ role in resolving complaints and guiding schools. The OCR had the infrastructure to investigate cases, mediate disputes and issue clear policy guidance — capacities that most states simply do not have.
State laws addressing sexual discrimination in education vary dramatically — some provide strong protections, while others offer only limited coverage or lack enforcement mechanisms altogether. Kansas, for example, has antidiscrimination laws that do not explicitly cover education, leaving it unclear whether any state agency can investigate student complaints.
And in half the country, LGBTQ+ students still lack explicit statutory protection. In practice, that means a student’s rights depend less on Title IX itself than on where they happen to go to school.
The problems run deeper than just inadequate alternatives. Even under the current system, protections are already narrow: Schools must act only if complaints reach officials with the power to make institutional changes. A report to a trusted coach, professor or resident assistant may lead nowhere. When schools do respond, the standard is remarkably low — acknowledging a complaint or opening a limited investigation often satisfies legal requirements.
These narrow protections are becoming even less reliable as transparency erodes. The Department of Education stopped updating its public list of investigations in January 2025 and only resumed in June, after months of silence. As of August 2025, just 10 resolutions involving sexual discrimination at colleges had been posted — and half predated Trump’s second inauguration. Without accurate information, students have little insight into whether schools are being held accountable at all.
 
The narrowing scope of federal protection
Title IX was written to ensure equal educational opportunity regardless of sex. But weak regulations, enforcement delays and shrinking federal oversight are steadily eroding that promise.
For students, the reality is stark: telling the wrong person about a complaint may trigger no response; minimal efforts by schools often satisfy legal requirements; and the federal agency once charged with oversight is being sidelined. If a litigation-only model takes hold, most students will have no realistic path to relief unless they can hire a lawyer and withstand years of court proceedings.
As I further explain in a new law review article — “No Department, No Enforcement” — Title IX remains law, but without meaningful enforcement it risks becoming a guarantee in name only. For students, that means rights promised but rarely delivered.

Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake to trade barbs and make political points, an annual pilgrimage repeated Wednesday.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) fist-pumps Wednesday for a crowd of his supporters at the J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake in Crisfield. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/ Maryland Matters)They came to Crisfield by boat and by car, moving in packs with bused-in entourages, or in quiet solitude.
Pulled by tradition and strict electoral calendar observance, candidates for governor — the announced, the filed and the explorers — arrived at a patch of marina blacktop Wednesday that is home to the J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake. The annual event draws locals for a day of crabs, corn and beer and it draws the political class from far-flung corners of the state who come to crack crabs, kibitz and talk political smack.
That started with Gov. Wes Moore (D), who name-checked a growing list of potential Republican challengers to his 2026 reelection before dismissing them for refusing to speak out against President Donald Trump (R) and his policies.
“We’ve heard nothing from them,” Moore told reporters. “So, to be honest, it kind of doesn’t matter to me who gets in the race, whether it’s Andy Harris or [John] Myrick or [Steve] Hershey or [Larry] Hogan … because they’re all saying the same things when it comes to lifting up the people of Maryland and defending the people of Maryland, which is absolutely nothing.”
Hogan was the only one on Moore’s list who was not in attendance Wednesday. For more than a decade, the two-term former governor was a mainstay at the event, a consummate retail politician. But not this year, despite talk that he might make an appearance in the tent of Annapolis power lobbyist and Tawes booster Bruce Bereano.
But Hogan was still part of the Tawes conversation.
Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore), who is exploring a run for governor, said he has “had a number of people ask about it and ask me how the exploratory aspect of it is going.”

“You know, we’re doing well. We’re getting a lot of people interested,” he said, before adding, “I think a lot of people are still waiting to hear what Gov. Hogan wants to do.”
When asked if he was among that group waiting on Hogan, Hershey said: “Yes.”
Hershey entered Somers Cove Marina through a back entrance, and did not bring a campaign with him. Not so Moore,  who arrived at the event by boat, fresh off a tour of Smith Island.
The governor, who announced his re-election bid two weeks ago, was joined by Lt. Gov Aruna Miller, who did not join her running mate on the boat but quietly mixed in with the throng following Moore. That included several dozen not-so-quiet supporters decked out in campaign shirts and signs, chanting in support of Moore.
“This is grassroots,” Moore said of the supporters, some of whom said they were bused to the event from Prince George’s County and Baltimore City.
The crab feast – in its 48th year — is named for J. Millard Tawes, a former governor and state comptroller who hailed from Crisfield. Once a fundraiser for Tawes, the event has since morphed into a fundraiser for the Crisfield Chamber of Commerce.
For decades it has been a popular destination for political leaders — especially in election years — and regular folks. This year’s event is the last before the 2026 primary next June.
Before arriving Wednesday, Moore sought to bolster his bipartisan credibility by releasing a list of Republicans who support him.
“We actually have a series of Republican lawmakers who represented over 200,000 Marylanders and who are coming out and saying that despite the fact that I happen to be a Democrat, and they happen to be a Republican, that they are coming out to support our re-election,” Moore said. “And it is because we have kept to our word to leave no one behind.”
Washington County Commission President John Barr and Rising Sun Mayor Travis Marion are on the list of Republicans endorsing Moore, along with two Allegany County officials, Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton and Lonaconing Mayor Jack Coburn.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Also on the list were former Del. Carl Anderton and former Carroll County Commissioner Ed Rothstein. Moore’s release did not mention that both now have jobs within his administration: Anderton was named director of rural strategy in the Maryland Department of Commerce last year and Rothstein was named secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families in July.
“So, in other words, a paid political announcement by employees of Wes Moore,” Hershey said.
Moore dismissed the critique as “ridiculous.”
“I understand that there are people with fledgling campaigns they are trying to get off the ground. It’s not my job to try to lift them up. My job is to support the people of this state,” he said. “So, when I hear ridiculous comments and I’m asked for comment, my comment is I don’t have a comment.”
Anderton said his support rose from Moore’s efforts to assist a regional airport and medical center.
“That was enough for me right there,” Anderton said. “A friend in need is a friend indeed. He’s never denied us. To me, that’s value.”
Moore dissent
As Moore’s crowd chanted — clad in their matching T-shirts, with their matching signs — a few counterprotesters emerged from the tents nearby, including Don Howell, a bearded Eastern Shore resident wearing a “Jesus” T-shirt, with a sticker for Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) attached.

The “We want Moore” chants, he said, were interrupting his time feasting on steamed crabs and talking with friends.
“He’s already taken all my money,” Howell said of the governor. “Now he wants to take my conversations?”
The 68-year-old, who lives in the Eastern Shore’s Mount Vernon, near Princess Anne, said he supports Republican John Myrick in next year’s gubernatorial contest, in part because of Myrick’s “commonsense” approach to pocketbook issues. He pointed to Myrick’s proposals for property tax credits for retirees.
“I’m a senior citizen, and I’m trying to survive on Social Security. My wife still works, but it’s hard,” Howell said. “Our electric bills are going sky high.”
Howell argued that Moore has funneled money to “illegal aliens” and energy affordability programs, wasting a surplus handed down by Hogan. He decried recent increases in government fees, including for car registrations and hunting licenses.
“You’re a thief!” he shouted as the governor passed by. “You’re a criminal! You don’t belong in government, you belong in jail!”
He also yelled “Go back to Prince George’s County” at Moore’s chanting supporters.
Myrick came to Tawes for the chance to take shots at Moore, as he angles for a general election face-off. He brushed off concerns about a potential primary challenge from Hogan.
“I entered this race for a general election race. That man is my opponent,” he said, pointing toward the governor, who was close by. “I really don’t care about what Gov. Hogan does.”
Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident who grew up in Harford County, said he is canvassing around the state, including stops on the Eastern Shore.

“The people that I’m hearing on the lower Eastern Shore have been forgotten about for a long, long time. The only time the politicians seem to come down here is the Tawes event,” Myrick said.
Even though Moore included Harris on his list of potential opponents, the eight-term congressman from the Eastern Shore said Wednesday at Tawes that he will not be jumping into the fray.
“We do need a governor — not a presidential candidate — to run the state,” Harris said, poking Moore over persistent gossip that he wants to run for president. “But I’m not going to run for governor.”
Harris said he is taking his time when it comes to deciding who to endorse in the governor’s race, in part because Maryland has two former Republican governors who would be eligible to run again: Hogan and Robert Ehrlich. The filing deadline for the race is not until Feb. 24.
“There’s obviously at least one or two very high-profile former governors who don’t need to file early,” Harris said. “So, look, I’m waiting until February to see what happens.”
Harris, a staunch supporter of Trump, backed the president on several issues Wednesday. He said the administration raised “valid concerns” that the effort to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge with federal dollars will follow state law requiring minority-owned business participation.
He also said he stands by Trump’s effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, though it has meant some 15,100 Marylanders have lost federal jobs since January. Harris pointed to the Moore administration’s voluntary separation offers for state employees in response to the state’s budget crunch.
“I don’t understand why he’s criticizing the president. He’s doing exactly the same thing in the state for state employees,” Harris said.
Harris also attacked the Moore administration for fee increases engineered to address the state’s budget crisis.
“The governor can go around saying he provided some minuscule tax break on income taxes, whereas every Marylander who opens up their car registration renewal understands that the fees are out of control,” Harris said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1313-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 02:57:05.438235

(Photo courtesy of Rita Gomez)When I was growing up in Pensacola, the local radio station often ran ads for a tire repair business whose slogan was, “Tires ain’t pretty.” I thought of that simple declaration this week when I heard the story of a big fight in Dunnellon over used tire disposal.
The person who told me the story is a woman in her 70s named Rita Gomez. She lives on a 30-acre parcel of land with a horse, a herd of cattle known as Zebu, and quite a few gopher tortoises. She’s far enough out in the country that her driveway is a mile long.
Next door to her is a 15-acre homesite whose owner has posted a sign calling it his “Black Fortress.” The primary feature of Black Fortress: its walls. They are made of stacks and stacks of black tires — truck tires, tractor tires, you name it.
It looks like someone invaded a Krispy Kreme to stack a bunch of the donuts on top of each other in rows. There are more than 1,500 tires forming this immense fence, perhaps as many as 2,000, Gomez said.
The property owner, whose name is Derek Peoples, has surrounded his entire property in Marion County with the stacks of used tires. Each tire is filled with dirt, mulch, or even (pee-ew!) horse poop, Gomez told me.
Now Peoples has begun lining his driveway with them too, she said.
“Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” Robert Frost once wrote. I think that goes double for a wall made of smelly old tires.
“There is no justifiable reason for this environmental hazard in our community to continue to exist,” Gomez told me.
She sent me pictures of the tires as well as a photo of a sign that Peoples placed in front of the property advertising that it’s a government-run site. But it’s not.
“It is incorrect to claim your property is either a government facility or a solid waste facility,” an official of the state Department of Environmental Protection wrote to Peoples in February. The DEP informed him that his sign “is not accurate or correct” and warned him not to bring in any more tires.
So far, the sign is still there, and Gomez says she’s seen him bringing in more tires, too.
Still, Peoples’ fortress-like farm fence is far from the worst way that Floridians have disposed of old tires.

Like the moon
Tire disposal has been a problem ever since part-time Florida man Harvey Firestone first sold a set to go on one of part-time Florida man Henry Ford’s Model Ts.
The original plan was just to junk them. Toss those bald tires in the nearest landfill! Fill it to the rim with radials!
By the 2000s, there were some 300 million used tires thrown on the scrap heap annually, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But they would routinely fill up with rainwater, breeding mosquitoes and attracting rats.
As another option, you could burn them.
But tire fires “often become major hazardous incidents affecting entire communities — frequently requiring neighborhood evacuations and long, drawn-out fire extinguishing operations” the EPA noted. “In 1983, a 7 million tire fire in Rhinehart, Va., issued a plume of smoke 3,000 feet high and nearly 50 miles long with air pollution emissions deposited in three states. It burned for nine months, polluting nearby water sources with lead and arsenic.”
Then someone came up with an even worse idea.
Beginning in the 1960s, people around Florida began lashing old tires together and dropping them in the water offshore to create “tire reefs.” Millions of tires went into these offshore sites over the next 30 years.
“At the time, it was thought that tire placement would increase reef populations, promote tourism and fishing activity, and improve habitats for fish species with minimal economic or environmental costs,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.
Except it turns out the tire reefs were actually harming both the fish and the waterways. Oops!
“Unfortunately,” NOAA said, “after years of monitoring, scientists determined artificial tire reefs often have not improved fish populations as intended, and the tires have instead caused significant environmental harm. Tires can leach toxic chemicals into the water and can degrade into smaller particles, contributing to microplastic pollution.”
Osborne Reef via U.S. Navy
The most notorious tire reef in Florida is the Osborne Reef off Fort Lauderdale, which consists of more than 1 million tires. They’re damaging a real coral reef nearby, too.
A diver interviewed by NPR in 2007 described the underwater Osborne scene this way: “It’s like the moon or something. It’s weird. It doesn’t look like anything you can imagine. It’s just tires for as far as you can see down there.”
Dedicated divers have been steadily pulling the old tires out, but by one estimate there are still 500,000 left out there. Completing the cleanup may take another decade.
A similar but smaller disaster happened off Pinellas County.  Evidence of what could go wrong cropped up just last year.
“A reef project from the 70s is turning into an environmental problem in Pinellas County as old tires wash onto the beach,” WTSP-TV reported in December. “Back-to-back hurricanes dislodged the tires, which were placed in the water decades ago to create artificial reefs.”
NOAA has awarded Pinellas a $2.2 million grant to clean up the mess it created, a process expected to take at least two more years.
OK, so piling the tires up in a landfill is bad. Burning them is bad. Dropping them offshore is bad. How about grinding them up and turning them into your child’s playground?
Nope. Turns out that’s bad for the kiddies.
“Children playing on tire crumb could potentially be exposed by ingestion of the product directly, by ingestion of surface water runoff through the product, by inhalation of dust, or by skin contact with the material or surface water runoff,” a 2005 study found.
Steven J. Laux via UF
I contacted Steven J. Laux, a solid waste expert at the University of Florida, to ask if there was any safe way to dispose of old tires. He said recycling works. The shredded components can become part of a new road, he said, meaning you could use new tires to drive on old tires. Your new tires could contain bits of old tires, too.
Because I am a curious guy, I checked. Guess where the biggest tire recycling plant in Florida is located: Marion County.
And I don’t think their perimeter fence is made out of Michelins, either.
Chicanery and clear springs
Dunnellon was founded more than a century ago amid some deliberate chicanery.
The town founder was a close-mouthed Ocala banker named John Dunn (where the “ellon” part came from, I don’t know). In 1890, he worked with the elaborately mustachioed Albertus Vogt and a chemist named R.R. Snowden to secretly amass as much acreage as possible after Vogt discovered a phosphate deposit while sinking a well.
They managed to pull together 13,000 acres, dug up as much phosphate as they could excavate, and shipped it out via river and then railroad. So many people showed up hoping for a piece of the action that Dunnellon got the unlikely nickname “Boomtown.”
By the 1920s, the phosphate deposit had played out, and the mining moved southward to Polk County. Little Dunnellon hung on, but just barely. In an official history of the city, the next significant event mentioned is the on-location filming of the 2001 horror movie “Jeepers Creepers”
Rainbow Springs State Park via Florida Park Service
To me, though, Dunnellon’s finest feature is Rainbow Springs State Park, which began life as a privately owned tourist attraction in the 1930s.
he Bahama Belles performing at Rainbow Springs via Florida State Archives
The park offered glass-bottom boat tours, waterfalls built atop the old phosphate mines, and a monorail. You could enjoy watching a swim team called the Bahama Belles and even an occasional mermaid like at Weeki Wachee Springs.
But that rodent-oriented theme park in Orlando drew most would-be visitors away, and the new interstate bypassed the region, making the tourist tires turn elsewhere. In 1974, the Rainbow Springs private attraction closed. It reopened as a state park in 1995.
Needless to say, the main attraction remains the crystal waters. But Rainbow Springs, like many springs around the state, is now facing some serious problems, including nitrate pollution and decreases in the historic flow due to over-pumping of groundwater.
Now add “contaminated tire runoff” to the mix, and you can see why using tires to build a wall might be a problem.
Don’t tread on me
I tried multiple times in multiple ways to contact Peoples, the Fortress Builder, but he didn’t respond to my calls, texts, or emails.
I read in some Marion County court records that when a process server tried to hand him a notice about being sued by a bank, he told her she was trespassing and ordered her off his property.

On the other hand, the somewhat confusing sign on his fence specifically says, “No Trespassing, Harassment, Threatening Violence or Lying Against Sanctioned Government Facility Will Result in Criminal Prosecution, Charges, Fines and Tort. You Will Lose. This Sign Is Exhibit B.” (No mention of what Exhibit A might be.)
Instead of “Black Fortress,” perhaps he should have just posted a picture of a bald tire with the slogan, “Don’t Tread On Me.”
I asked Rita Gomez how the tire wall got started four years ago.
“One day he dropped one tire,” she recalled. Gomez asked Peoples’ wife what was going on, and remembers her saying, “Don’t worry about it, this has nothing to do with you.”
But of course, it has had everything to do with the neighbors and the whole community.
Gomez told me when she saw what he was building, she began making repeated complaints to both Marion County and the state DEP. She was particularly steamed when she saw that the wall of tires was blocking the path of a threatened gopher tortoise.
I contacted both DEP and Marion County code enforcement about what’s happening with this literal embodiment of the “tires ain’t pretty” concept.
“The property owner originally used a limited number of tires filled with soil as planters and barriers,” Sarah Fayed of the DEP told me via e-mail. “In 2021, DEP issued a letter outlining limited beneficial use, but this was not intended as a perpetual authorization.”
After that February letter that told Peoples to stop bringing in tires, “any new tires placed since that time are not authorized by DEP,” she wrote. “DEP continues to monitor the matter and will evaluate next steps as appropriate.”
And Marion County spokesperson Stacie Causey told me that Peoples’ ever-growing tire collection is the basis of “an open investigation” for code enforcement.
Gomez shared with me a text that Peoples sent her four years ago, after getting wind of her first complaints about what he was doing. He threatened a lawsuit that he never filed.
“You all cannot dictate what we can do on our land,” he told her.
Yet, as any student of American civics knows, your local government’s zoning code and state and federal environmental regulations can and should dictate what you do or don’t do on your property.
That’s because — despite all the Florida politicians we’ve heard ranting and raving about the importance of property rights — what you do on your property can affect everyone around you, either via the air or the water. There is no “right to pollute” in either the state or federal constitution.
Legally speaking, this is where the rubber meets the road.

The Gov. Ned Lamont rightly vetoed HB5002 due to opposition from towns who were concerned about overreach and implementation. 
There is a way forward without a heavy handed, top-down bill that does not recognize the variety in the state.
One of the issues from HB 5002 was that it was a mash up of 30 something bills that do not seem coordinated for implementation. Fair share was included, but does not recognize private market middle housing for improving supply nor pricing of housing. Fair share seems to prioritize large, multi-million-dollar complexes from distant owners and managers of property that many of whom seek government grants and tax deferrals/abatements. 
The rest of us do not qualify for those benefits and the distant owners may not care one iota about what they leave behind. Some of these projects are started to falsely pretend to be housing when they are really natural resource extraction, leaving towns with no way to actually enforce the construction of the project they changed the zoning rules for.
Our country was founded on free will and choice. Political polarization is often the result of one perspective telling others how they need to live their lives, despite being in different circumstances. Whether the culture wars of the right, or progressive admonitions of the left, resentment is bred among half of the population. There is a better way.
In the 2023 and 2025 sessions, Montana decided to build housing like we used to, with much less restrictive zoning. Some zoning is good but perhaps has become too stringent in the 21st century; nullifying meeting the needs of people now, vs 50 years ago. Many people like the old town centers and cities that were mixed use, intensively developed, walkable with a variety of retail and service providers readily accessible. That is not for everyone, but a choice that many would like to have again.
The 2023 session in Montana outlined potential 15 changes for municipalities of over 5,000 people to consider and required adoption of five. That lets towns decide what plan is appropriate for their residents and includes all sorts of ideas to expand affordable housing. Whether detached or attached, subsidized or not, cheaper housing all shares lower land cost from increased units/acre and smaller construction cost per unit. 
Choice is the key to acceptance by the general public that elected leaders are listening to their constituents.
Montana’s 2023 session SB 382 required towns to adopt five of the following 15 changes:

Allow for at least two residential units per lot on the majority of land zoned residential
Allow mixed-use zoning
Zone for increased density near transit, employment, higher education, and other appropriate population centers
Provide decreased parking requirements
Reduce/eliminate local fees for development including housing
Allow Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) in all zones
Allow single room occupancy developments
Create Community Land Trusts and rezone those Land Trust Lands to higher density
Reduce or eliminate impact fees for ADU’s
Allow triplex or fourplex residential units/lot
Reduce or eliminate minimum lot sizes
Reduce or eliminate aesthetic, material, shape, bulk, size, height, floor area, and other massing requirements
Provide zoning that specifically allows or encourages the development of tiny houses
Reduce or eliminate setback requirements
Allow residential development in all areas zoned to allow office, retail, or commercial development as a permitted use.

I do not walk in each person’s shoes in Connecticut, and do not expect carte blanch acceptance of this list; however, as the Chair of the Independent Party of Connecticut, I firmly believe in the party’s commitment to listening to the best ideas no matter where they originate. 
I believe Montana’s approach is a good start to revise HB 5002 to a bill that can pass and be accepted by the majority of stakeholders including homeowners, renters, state and local government, developers, property managers and landlords. 
Our problem with the cost of housing and the availability of housing in the state is solvable when you have the right leaders in the room representing every stakeholder and collaborating as empathetic peers to drive towards the best outcomes. 
More choice and market-driven solutions will solve the housing problem, not government largesse.  Looking to other states for inspiration can provide us with a proven path forward that could be adopted to let all Connecticut residents have the life they aspire to.

Comptroller Sean Scanlon estimates somewhere between 103,000 to 171,000 people could lose their Medicaid coverage due to $13 billion in cuts over the next decade, and the state could pay as much as $173 million a year just to maintain current SNAP services.
Access Health CT, the Affordable Care Act program, also estimates a loss of up to 50,000 enrollees by 2034 due to higher costs, and it could run $32 million a year to offset lost federal subsidies.
This threatens a maternal and infant health safety net that Connecticut legislators and public health agencies have been working on for years, marked most recently by legislation tackling issues ranging from birthing centers to maternal mental health.
And for us this situation heightens concern that the rate of infant deaths may rise, reversing an overall decline in Connecticut infant mortality rates since 2015, even though racial disparities persist – Black infant mortality rates are three times higher than white – and Medicaid coverage for Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska native peoples is also three times higher.
The threats from this increase would be both health-related and societal.
If women become uninsured, their access to prenatal care is reduced, putting them at higher risk for preterm birth and low birthweight babies.  And this risk cascades: preterm birth and low birthweight babies are also at greater risk for Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), a sleep-related cause that includes Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unknown causes, and Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed. It is the number one cause of death for U.S. infants in their first year of life.
The societal threat is that greater stress will be put on daily life under social determinants of health and the families who navigate it. Economics, systemic racism, limited access to resources, and other factors are the backdrop against which decisions regarding infant sleep are made.
The Office of Child Advocate names unsafe sleep-related death as number one in preventable infant deaths in Connecticut, with no decline in ten years. The American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep guidelines have babies sleeping on their backs alone, on a firm, flat surface with no bedding or loose materials to reduce the likelihood of unsafe sleep-related death. However, parents or caregivers exhausted from work and childcare may instead place their crying infant in bed with them, either out of lack of knowledge, or desperation.
Connecticut lawmakers are “getting it” that maternal and infant health depends on an integrated safety net to counter the health and societal pressures, but many enacted programs are still in development stages. And now hospitals face declining Medicaid reimbursement and reduced provider taxes. The new federal law will offer some rural health provider funding, termed “modest” by Scanlon.
Nonetheless, Connecticut must do whatever it can to safeguard its maternal and infant health infrastructure. This includes applying for the $50 billion five-year Rural Health Transformation Program, and meeting in legislative special session this month to assess shortfalls and how the Rainy Day fund and general fund surplus can help offset them. SNAP changes hit in late 2026 and Medicaid in 2027, effectively around the corner.
This may also be the time to change Connecticut’s infant safe sleep public health messaging.
In 2015 Connecticut legislated that hospital maternity facilities provide written safe sleep guidelines based on American Academy of Pediatrics standards. But a 2020 study found that while there was no significant change in SUID or SIDS rates post-legislation, more infants died from positional asphyxia than before. Study authors suggested that the effectiveness of this legislation should be re-examined.
Our organization has been teaching AAP safe sleep to health care professionals since being a part of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-led Back to Sleep campaign in the 1990s, which cut national SIDS rates by 50%. Rates have since largely levelled off, while racial disparities have grown.
These facts have made us re-evaluate our effectiveness and make changes to reduce rates of unsafe sleep-related death. Today we take a community-based approach to meet with families where they work and live, in partnership with trusted community members  – doulas, social workers, lactation consultants – as well as peers.  The sessions are regular, informal, non-judgmental yet purposeful in talking about safe sleep, breastfeeding, and family challenges and needs. We also collaborate with hospitals to meet in NICUs.
The qualitative research feedback on our programs indicates positive changes in awareness and behavior around caregiver decisions as to how and where an infant sleeps, indicating a community-based approach could be an effective addition to the public health messaging to bolster Connecticut’s maternal and infant safety net.

Chris Murphy’s call to ban private capital investment in Connecticut’s healthcare system.
Recent cases of mismanagement of healthcare facilities in the state clearly show what can happen when bad actors put profits ahead of patients. Hospitals are left in limbo, patients are left without access to care, and the vulnerable communities they serve are left to pay the price. However, not all private investment is created equal, and we must not overlook the positive role that responsible private investment continues to play in the healthcare ecosystem.
Across the country, responsible investors have stepped up to secure access to healthcare for patients by rescuing struggling healthcare facilities. By introducing innovative and tech forward approaches to treatment and providing administrative support that stabilizes operations, private capital can give providers the tools they need to focus on patients. That is the difference between exploitative practices and sustainable investments that truly strengthen our healthcare infrastructure.
Take for example, American Family Care (AFC). With the help of private capital investors, AFC has grown into one of the nation’s most successful urgent care providers, with 16 centers serving Connecticut communities. By leveraging advanced technology for billing, record keeping, and patient services, AFC provides patients with convenient, affordable, and accessible care when they need it most.
Senator Murphy has rightly called out cases of mismanagement and we support efforts that would address these specific issues. However, painting all private capital with the same brush risks doing more harm than good. A balanced approach is needed to differentiate between bad actors and responsible investors.
Connecticut shouldn’t rush to curtail much-needed private investment and overlook the many examples of responsible investors that put patient-centered care at the forefront of their operations. We welcome the opportunity to discuss how to navigate these complexities while fostering the responsible private investments that provide a needed lifeline to struggling facilities and improve patient care.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A national free speech watchdog is calling for a Montana State University-Northern professor to return to work after she was placed on a leave of absence following social media comments critical of Charlie Kirk.
The issue in Havre highlights the conservative firestorm over how people talked about the late right-wing influencer’s career. A movement immediately following Kirk’s death sought to expose those who spoke in ways they perceived to be negative of right-wing influencer, which was fanned by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and got late night host Jimmy Kimmel suspended from his show.
Kirk, who was 31 at the time of his death, was a controversial right-wing influencer noted for his reach among young people and as a passionate defender of free speech.
High-profile right-wing influencers targeted Montanans for social media posts they made in the days that followed Kirk’s death. This has led to threats against people and businesses across the state as well as suspended a professor.
Samantha Balemba-Brownlee, an associate professor at MSU-Northern in criminal justice, was put on leave by the school earlier this month following comments she made on Facebook critical of Kirk.
This led to a letter in her defense from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression to MSU-Northern last week. Balemba-Brownlee’s comments were also included in the letter.
“Not condoning violence, but maybe people are sick of the garbage he spews, perhaps?” they read in part. 
She also wrote, “He was a misogynistic, racist, homophobic, xenophobic a–hole. He spread hate. He harmed society. He cut down women at every turn. No, I do not mourn the man.” And “Update: He died. Aw shucks. Thoughts and prayers.”
The organization sent the letter to Greg Kegel, the school’s Chancellor, on Sept. 17, asking for a response by Sept. 23. 
 MSU-Northern did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for the state board of regents said they do not comment on personnel matters.
“If MSUN chooses to ignore its free speech obligations and punish protected faculty speech, it will open the door to censorship of countless views on campus and chill others from sharing their opinions,” the letter reads. “Both of these outcomes are unacceptable at an institution bound by the First Amendment.”
The letter also added that any criticism of Balemba-Brownlee’s comments was also protected speech.
“To be sure, this principle does not shield Balemba-Brownlee from every consequence of her speech — including criticism by other students, faculty, or the broader community,” the letter reads. “Criticism is a form of the ‘more speech,’ the remedy that the First Amendment prefers over censorship. But MSUN’s obligations under the First Amendment limit the types of consequences it may impose, and investigating faculty for their protected expression clearly violates that commitment.”
Much of the issue was stirred up on social media and Balemba-Brownlee received death threats, Lee Newspapers reported.
In the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death, conservatives — especially online influencers — began to track negative or perceived bad-taste comments made about Kirk’s life. 
One of the biggest names was Chaya Raichik, who posts online as “Libs of TikTok” and boasts 4.4 million followers on X. Raichik posted about Balemba-Brownlee on Sept. 17.
“Samantha is allegedly not even a U.S. citizen!” Raichik wrote in a post that showed the Facebook comments and reached more than a half million views. “Her visa should be REVOKED @StateDept @SecRubio We do not want foreigners who justify m*rder in our country!”
Raichik’s claim could not be verified. Balemba-Brownlee did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
An hour before her MSU-Northern tweet, Raichik posted about a Billings teacher, Dan Johnson. Raichik posted a screenshot of a Facebook post from Johnson.
“Charlie Kirk’s death is literally chickens coming home to roost. Rouse me for something worth anyone’s time,” reads the screenshot of a post, purportedly written by Johnson.
Raichik tagged the Billings school district in her post. Inquiries to the Billings Public Schools sent by the Daily Montanan went unreturned. Johnson did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.
The social media whiplash against criticism of Kirk in Montana was not limited to teachers, state employees were targeted too.
In yet another post, Raichik went after an employee of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.
“Keith Leathers is a Child Support Investigator for the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services,” Raichik wrote. “He reportedly posted “He was a white nationalist. He isn’t worth remembering.” Our tax dollars pay his salary. What’s @DPHHSMTdoing about this?”
The DPHHS did not immediately return a request for comment. When reached, Leathers said he was not sure if he was cleared to speak to a reporter. Raichik’s DPHHS post got more than 200,000 views and quoted a post from a local far-right news source, the Missoula Sentinel. 
In a post on its website, the Sentinel collected more than a dozen screenshots from various people in Montana criticizing Kirk.
Businesses in the state were targeted too, including Five on Black in Missoula and a coffee shop in Bozeman. 
An account with nearly 70,000 followers, posting with the handle “@Missus_Massacre” posted about both Montana businesses. Those posts spread over the right-wing social mediasphere, with one quoted by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani that included the Bozeman coffee shop’s phone number. 
In Missoula, a Five on Black employee shared a meme laughing at Kirk’s death, leading to backlash. The Missus_Massacre account posted a screenshot of the employee’s post, and included the name as well as the addresses and phone numbers for both Five on Black locations.
That post was seen more than 400,000 times and Five on Black’s owner, Tom Snyder, responded on X, saying he had a “direct and difficult” conversation with the employee, but would not be firing him.
Snyder then spoke to threats that had followed.
“My staff and I have been flooded with angry calls, hateful emails, racial slurs sent to my personal email, and hundreds of one-star reviews,” Snyder wrote. “Young employees, both right leaning and left leaning, feel nervous coming into work, worried someone will come in angry or threatening. A 20-year-old employee cannot be expected to field hundreds of abusive calls.”
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte addressed negative comments of Kirk in a statement on X. He also brought up a 2023 law that prohibits employees from being fired for social media posts.
“It’s disgusting to see people using their freedom of speech to celebrate Charlie Kirk’s murder on social media and further divide our country,” Gianforte’s statement reads. “I swore an oath to uphold the laws of Montana and our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, regardless of how vile it is.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kirkmemorialservice-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 23:58:09.777777

Buttgereit struggled to afford health coverage after her husband’s death and was uninsured when she slipped on some ice in Montana and broke her arm. The surgery bill was nearly $98,000, well above the initial estimate the hospital provided. (Parker Michels-Boyce for KFF Health News)As soon as she fell, Deborah Buttgereit knew she couldn’t avoid going to the hospital.
“I could hear the bones moving around in my elbow,” said Buttgereit, who was 60 when she slipped on a patch of ice in December outside her apartment in Bozeman.
Emergency room scans showed she had fractured her left arm near the joint. Doctors told her she needed surgery to repair it.
At the time, Buttgereit didn’t have health insurance — she had struggled to afford coverage after her husband’s death. The local health system, Bozeman Health, estimated Buttgereit would have to pay $50,560 out-of-pocket for the outpatient surgery to have her elbow pieced back together.
The estimate noted: “You could be charged more if complications or special circumstances occur.”
Four days after her fall, Buttgereit went in for surgery, which took about three hours. During a follow-up visit, she said, her doctor told her the procedure ended up being more complicated than expected.
Then the bill came.
  The Medical Procedure 

Buttgereit broke her humerus, the upper-arm bone that meets two other bones and forms the elbow. The way the bone splintered is known as a distal humerus fracture. It’s rare as far as breaks go, accounting for only about 2% of all fractures among adults. But older people, as well as kids in high-contact sports, are more prone to the big falls that lead to such fractures. The injury is painful and can make it impossible to move the elbow.
Some of these types of fractures heal with time in a splint, but most often surgery is the only fix. The patient is put under anesthesia while a surgeon repositions fragmented bones with plates and screws.
  The Final Bill 

$97,998. That includes at least $44,300 for the operating room and anesthesia administration, plus more than $50,000 for medical supplies and implants, such as screws and plates. After the hospital applied a self-pay discount, Buttgereit was on the hook for $78,398.40.
  The Problem: Surprise Complications, Surprising Charges 

The hospital said the price for Buttgereit’s surgery increased because doctors encountered complications midprocedure.
In particular, the fall had shattered Buttgereit’s bone into more pieces than her surgeon anticipated, according to operating notes. That meant it took more time, skill, and supplies to reconstruct her elbow. And, since she was uninsured, Buttgereit alone faced the burden to pay the higher costs.
“I’ll make payments the rest of my life to pay it all off,” she said.
Buttgereit’s husband died suddenly in 2023. About a year later, she left her job with the company that had employed them both. The memories of him in that space were too difficult, she said. That also meant leaving behind her health coverage. She moved to Bozeman to be closer to one of her daughters and found a health plan at healthcare.gov that the federal government subsidized because of her limited income.
But she also faced a higher cost of living in Bozeman than her Social Security benefits could cover, and she needed part-time work. While that new income helped pay her bills, Buttgereit said, she no longer qualified for the same level of subsidized coverage and couldn’t afford her plan. So she dropped her health insurance.
About two months later, she fell.
After getting the surgery bill, Buttgereit began calling and emailing the hospital’s customer service team, asking how the price had risen from the $50,560 estimate to nearly $98,000. The hospital had automatically applied the self-pay discount of $19,600 to Buttgereit’s bill — 20% of the total. But that still left her with a tab of more than $78,000.
After more time to think pain-free, she said, she also wanted to know why the initial estimate was much steeper than those she found online for similar procedures.
Specifically, Buttgereit asked how to dispute her bill. When she felt she wasn’t making progress contesting the charges with the hospital, she asked about her options under the No Surprises Act, a federal consumer protection law.
According to emails reviewed by KFF Health News, a Bozeman Health billing employee incorrectly told Buttgereit the law applies only to ER services. The employee later said Buttgereit had the right to dispute the bill but gave her an incorrect deadline.
Hospital staffers recommended Buttgereit set up a payment plan and apply to the health system’s financial aid program.
Erin Schaible, a spokesperson with Bozeman Health, told KFF Health News that online estimates don’t reflect the specific details of a patient’s care. In addition to the shattered bones noted in Buttgereit’s surgery notes, Schaible said the physician identified nerve damage midsurgery that required additional work to fix.
“This situation highlights the importance of clear and compassionate communication,” Schaible said. “In response, our team leaders are revising internal protocols for escalating patient concerns and are reeducating staff on best practices for communicating cost estimate changes.”
  The Resolution 

Buttgereit refused to apply for financial aid, opting instead to challenge what she sees as inflated pricing. Using Healthcare Bluebook, an online price comparison tool that draws on insurance claims data, Buttgereit found similar procedures ranged from $8,000 to $40,000.
She said she believes that there are also errors on her bill and that the complications didn’t justify the price.
“I felt like going through financial assistance means that I’m OK with the price of the bill,” she said. “I want to get the bill reduced on the front end and then, if I need financial assistance, go through it.”
A billing employee emailed Buttgereit in May to offer an additional $7,000 discount if she set up a payment plan. If she later qualified for financial assistance, “we will adjust the amount accordingly,” the email said.
In June, the employee told Buttgereit her account would be put on hold before a collection process was initiated, “so that you have time to decide what to do.”
Buttgereit agreed to a payment plan of $100 a month, though she continued to contest the total charges.
At that rate, it would take about 60 years to pay off the debt — or longer, if the health system were to charge interest.
Buttgereit made one more bid for help: She emailed the White House.
This month, in the same week she got a detailed letter from the hospital standing by its charges, Buttgereit said she received a call from an official with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, saying she could dispute the bill to federal health officials.
  The Takeaway 

The best time to push back against a price is before surgery, upon receiving a hospital’s best guess on costs, known as a “good faith estimate.” Otherwise, undergoing surgery is considered tacit acceptance of that price as a baseline.
Patricia Kelmar, director of health care campaigns at the national consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG, follows ways in which people get tangled financially in the health industry. She said patients should compare cost estimates by searching their hospital’s online pricing tool (as well as those of nearby hospitals) to see whether the estimates align. But not every procedure makes those lists, especially those for uncommon injuries, nor is every hospital’s list easy to access and navigate.
Post-surgery, patients have few resources to fight big bills, but a little-known rule in the No Surprises Act could help, Kelmar said.
The law, which took effect in 2022, is best known for protecting patients from surprise bills for out-of-network, emergency care. But it also created a formal dispute process for uninsured patients, or those paying completely out-of-pocket for nonemergency procedures, if their final tab is $400 or more than the initial estimate.
“This is a valid, important part of making sure that patients who are cash-pay have a watchdog,” Kelmar said.
People can start the patient-provider dispute process online, through the CMS website, by providing medical records and paying a $25 fee. Patients must initiate the process within 120 days of receiving the bill, and the bill may not be sent to a collection agency while under review.
An independent reviewer evaluates whether the final price is drastically different from what a health insurance company would have paid and whether the complication was predictable. If the review finds that the health provider erred on either front, federal health officials could require them to reduce the bill to match the original estimate or the median price insurers pay.
Buttgereit said she initially opted against pursuing that formal dispute process because, after such a review, the floor would be the hospital’s initial estimate, and she still had questions about how it would work. But after hearing from CMS, Buttgereit said it’s the path she plans to take.
“You’ve got to fight for yourself,” she said. “I don’t know where this is going to end up, but I feel a little bit more hopeful.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters will resign from office with more than a year left in his term for a new position leading a conservative teacher organization, he announced Wednesday night while speaking live on FOX News.
Walters said he will become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a newly formed group that markets itself as an alternative to teacher unions. He expects to resign in early October, his campaign manager and senior adviser Matt Langston told Oklahoma Voice.
His resignation means Gov. Kevin Stitt will have to appoint a candidate to lead the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the state Board of Education through the rest of Walters’ term, which ends in January 2027. Stitt has not yet said who he will choose.
In a brief appearance on FOX late Wednesday night, Walters said he is “excited” to step down and accept his new position. He said his goal is to “destroy the teachers unions.”
“We have seen the teachers unions use money and power to corrupt our schools, to undermine our schools,” he said. “We are one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the country. We will build an army of teachers to defeat the teachers unions once and for all. So, this fight’s going national, and we will get our schools back on track.”
The Teacher Freedom Alliance has 2,617 enrolled members, according to its website.
Langston said he plans to leave the Education Department on Sept. 30. The Texas-based political strategist has been a top leader at the agency since Walters took office in January 2023 while at the same time working on various political campaigns.

Walters, a former teacher turned far-right-wing firebrand, was elected to a four-year term as Oklahoma’s top education official in 2022. He could have been eligible for a second term had he run for reelection.
For much of his two years and 10 months in office, he’s been at the center of numerous controversies, most recently for being at odds with Stitt, a former ally, and the state Board of Education.
His tactics frustrated even fellow conservatives when he abruptly and sometimes silently made significant changes to state education policy. Doing so prompted frequent criticism from both Republicans and Democrats that Walters sought self-promotion more than academic improvement in Oklahoma’s struggling public education system.
While he also put money into improving teacher recruitment and student tutoring, Walters spent much of his time in office railing against perceived liberal ideology while promoting education with a conservative, patriotic and pro-Bible lens. 
Although Walters has been widely expected to seek higher office, he mentioned no plans for a future political campaign. His new position won’t require him to move out of state, Langston said.
Like Walters, the Teacher Freedom Alliance is a vocal critic of teacher unions. The Freedom Foundation, a national conservative think tank, created the Teacher Freedom Alliance this year to offer liability insurance, professional development, and “alternative curriculums and pedagogies” to educators.
Walters celebrated the organization’s launch in March by encouraging educators to join it as “an alternative to woke teachers’ unions.”
“Today, Superintendent Ryan Walters announced intent to lead the charge to offer a private industry solution to the far left-leaning Teachers’ Unions that have infected our public education system for decades,” a March 10 news release from his office stated.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota renters who use Section 8 housing vouchers or other subsidies now enjoy the same eviction protections as all other renters, thanks to a Minnesota Supreme Court decision reversing precedent it set in 1995.
Landlords in Minnesota can evict tenants over lease violations, like using drugs or committing other crimes. But If a landlord accepts a rent payment after finding out about a lease violation, they can’t evict the tenant over that specific breach of the lease. In other words, by accepting a rent payment despite knowing about a lease violation, the landlord waives their right to evict.
This protection did not apply to renters who received public subsidies, including Section 8 housing vouchers, until Wednesday. 
“This case actually advances the law and restores fairness to what we thought was the correct outcome prior to the court’s 1995 decision,” said Julia Zwak, managing attorney for housing at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, which brought the case. 
The Minnesota Human Rights Act prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive rental assistance. Wednesday’s court decision brings case law in line with state statutes, Zwak said. 
The previous precedent allowed landlords to bring evictions against subsidized renters at any time based on conduct that the landlord didn’t consider serious enough to warrant an eviction at the time, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Sarah Hennesy wrote in the decision.
“But even when retaliation is not in play, it is important for landlords to decide quickly whether to evict based on a known breach. When a tenant’s breach harms or disturbs other tenants, the other tenants benefit from a system that requires a landlord to act quickly,” Hennesy wrote.
The case originated from a tenant, Nichole Nalewaja, who was living in Hook & Ladder Apartments in Minneapolis and using a Section 8 voucher to cover rent. The voucher doesn’t cover utilities, however, and she fell behind on electricity bills; her electricity was shut off in early October 2022, according to court records.
Nalewaja and her boyfriend broke into the building’s electrical box to reconnect their service, but accidentally shut off others’ electricity in the process. Hook & Ladder learned about the electrical box tampering — a lease violation — on Oct. 5, 2022. The landlord continued accepting rent payments from the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, which administers the rental assistance vouchers, over the following months.
The landlord initiated an eviction against Nalewaja in March 2023 over the electrical box break-in, despite having received thousands of dollars in public money after the lease violation. A renter who didn’t receive assistance likely could’ve had the case quickly dismissed because Hook & Ladder had accepted several rent payments between the time of the violation and the initiation of the eviction; Nalewaja could not. 
Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid took on Nalewaja’s case and saw an opportunity to challenge the court precedent. Gary Van Winkle, a 35-year veteran Legal Aid housing attorney, carried the case all the way to the state Supreme Court — and got the outcome Legal Aid was hoping for. 
“Nichole Nalewaja stood up for herself, her neighbors and for all tenants who receive housing subsidies across the state,” Van Winkle said in a statement. “She challenged a 30-year-old court precedent and she won.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6226-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-24 23:58:09.777777

(Stock.adobe.com photo by Grandbrothers)One day after posting the official results from the Sept. 16 primary election for city offices, the Annapolis Board of Canvassers had second thoughts Wednesday, voting in an emergency meeting to conduct a hand recount of all ballots cast in the race.
In a news release announcing the decision, the board said it called for the recount in the wake of an election night  transcription error — which was caught and corrected during the official canvass — that led to vote totals briefly being assigned to the wrong candidates in the Ward 6 race.
It also comes with the final results posted Tuesday showing the candidates in the Ward 4 race separated by just four votes, with 144 votes for Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson to 140 votes for Coren Makell. Despite the narrow margin, however, Makell congratulated Allsup-Johnson and all the other Democratic primary winners Tuesday and pledged to “supporting you all in the general election.”
Eileen Leahy, the chair of the Annapolis Board of Canvassers, said the recount is aimed at giving additional assurances to voters that the final results are correct.
“The integrity of City elections is our highest priority,” Leahy said in a statement. “While the certification process worked as intended and the correct outcome was reported, we believe a full hand count audit will provide additional assurance to voters and demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accuracy.

“We appreciate our partnership with the Anne Arundel County Board of Elections and their willingness to demonstrate these values to both candidates and voters,” her statement said.
The city contracts with the board of elections to administer elections, and it will be conducting the audit at its Glen Burnie office beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday. That meeting will be open to the public.
City election officials said that hand count will review all in-person ballots cast in precincts on Election Day, review all mail-in and drop box ballots and verify that the certified results match the original voter-marked paper ballots.
The Board of Canvassers also said Wednesday that the county Board of Elections has put new safeguards in place for the Nov. 4 general election, “including on-site verification of results at the County facility on election night, immediate tape audits by election judges, and more robust checks before releasing unofficial results.”
Except for the possibility of a shift in the razor-thin margin of the Ward 4 race, the recount is unlikely to affect the outcome of any of the other contested city races in the Democratic primary. The closest margin in the other races was 51% of the vote for the winner of the Ward 1 race to 31% for the runner-up.
In the marquee race of the election, for the Democratic nomination for mayor, businessman Jared Littmann won 2,594 votes to 1,271 for longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, according to Tuesday’s results. Littmann now faces Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election to succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The second day of Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process saw plenty of fireworks on Wednesday, with Democrats and their dueling redistricting expert clashing with Republicans. 
The Utah Legislature’s newly convened Legislative Redistricting Committee’s heated exchanges reached a crescendo when the committee’s only two Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek — brought their hired expert, Daniel Magleby, a professor at SUNY Binghamton in New York, to present their preferred congressional map.
During their presentation, Magleby and Owens questioned whether Republicans’ retained redistricting expert — Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics who drew a set of five maps that were presented to the committee on Monday — used a method that incorporated partisan data on the front end of his process, which Democrats and Magleby alleged would be a violation of Proposition 4, the voter-approved law that established a framework for an independent redistricting process.

Magleby said if he were to “pull maps out of a simulated set where I’ve already screened out those that are not symmetrical, (that) would be illegal, as I understand it, under Prop 4. You’re not allowed to do that.”
Magleby said maps must first be drawn following Proposition 4’s criteria, and only after should they be analyzed for any “undue advantage or disadvantage on a particular group.” He questioned whether, by “culling” out maps that were tested for partisan symmetry, Trende’s map-drawing process would abide by Proposition 4. 
“If I’m only going to look at maps that are symmetrical to begin with, then I’ve already violated Proposition 4, and anything that comes from that is going to be illegal,” Magleby said. 
Owens added that “what he just described as being illegal, we strongly suspect has happened.” 
“We suspect there was a dataset incorporated into the test that Dr. Trende applied,” Owens said, though he also noted that Democrats’ requests to obtain Trende’s full data sets weren’t answered by Wednesday morning to help them verify that suspicion. “It’s as if we’re told to buy a car and we can’t lift the hood and look.” 
The committee’s co-chairs, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, and Sen. Scott Sandall, then interjected with protests, with Pierucci saying, “That’s a pretty big allegation” and Sandall calling a point of order. 
“You just demeaned us,” Sandall said, audibly angry. “I will not have that. You called us somehow hiding, lying, about everything that we’ve presented. … Our maps, these maps, were not developed with any political data. You just misrepresented that, and that’s out of order.” 
Wednesday’s committee marked the second time this week that the Legislative Redistricting Committee has met as lawmakers try to narrow down which map the full Utah Legislature will ultimately vote on during a special session on Oct. 6 to be submitted to a judge.

That judge — 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson — will ultimately decide which map will replace the 2021 congressional boundaries she voided in a ruling last month, which deemed that map a result of an unconstitutional process after lawmakers repealed and replaced Proposition 4 with a law that turned the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body lawmakers could ultimately ignore. 
While Republican legislative leaders vehemently disagree with Gibson’s ruling and continue to fight it in court — with an appeal pending in the Utah Supreme Court and statements that they also intend to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary — they have said in the meantime they’ll abide by Gibson’s order, which gave the Legislature until Oct. 6 to choose a preferred replacement congressional map. 
The judge also gave the same Oct. 6 deadline to plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit to submit a map for consideration. She has a deadline of Nov. 10 to choose a new congressional map in time for the 2026 midterm elections. 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee did not pick a preferred map on Wednesday. Instead, it left the door open for more map proposals — from both lawmakers and the public — to be submitted through the committee’s website, where the maps are made public. As of Wednesday afternoon, dozens of maps had been submitted to lawmakers since they began taking submissions for the 2025 map last week. 
The judge gave lawmakers until Thursday for an eligible proposed map to be “published” before a 10-day public comment period leading up to the Oct. 6 vote. Sandall said in order for a map to be considered for the Oct. 6 special session and meet the court’s publication deadline, it must be submitted through the commission’s website no later than the end of the day Thursday. 
“The Legislature cannot adopt a map that is not publicly available for comment starting tomorrow, Sept. 25,” Pierucci said. “So when we meet back in a special session, it will be one of these maps that were publicly available to meet the 10-day window that was outlined by Judge Gibson in her timeline and order.”
Sandall said lawmakers are “considering many options and we want to gather as much public comment as possible … so we’re soliciting feedback on multiple maps.”

“Public comment is meaningless if we make a decision today,” he said. 
During Wednesday’s meeting, the legislative committee reviewed all five map options drawn by Republicans’ retained expert, Trende, as well as Democrats’ preferred map drawn by Magleby. They also took comments from more than two dozen Utahns, with many urging lawmakers to avoid gerrymandering and follow Proposition 4, while several also expressed distrust in the Legislature’s stated intentions to carry out a “fair” process. 
Proposed maps
A significant chunk of Wednesday’s committee meeting focused on reviewing the five maps drawn by Republicans’ expert, Trende. 
All of the maps would be relatively more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 map that the court has since tossed out, though Republicans would still have an advantage in most of the districts. Under that 2021 map, Republicans have consistently dominated all four of Utah’s congressional seats. 
Democrats have expressed concerns with all five of those maps, resistant to mixing urban and rural areas. Republican legislative leaders including Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, have said, however, that they want a map that creates four districts that all represent “both urban and rural voices.” 
Utah’s current congressional map is a form of what’s been called the “slice of the pie” approach, dissecting Utah’s urban core and most populated area of Salt Lake County into four separate districts. 
In contrast, what’s known as a “doughnut hole” approach would create a map that may, for example, carve out a district concentrated around the state’s capital of Salt Lake City, the state’s darkest blue Democratic stronghold. 
Democrats’ preferred map, drawn by Magleby and named after Escamilla and Owens, carves out two doughnut-hole shapes, one around Salt Lake City and the northern part of Salt Lake County, and one around the southern part of Salt Lake County and northern Utah County. 
During Wednesday’s committee discussion, several Republican lawmakers expressed preference for maps that split the least number of cities and counties as possible, and those that mix rural and urban voices while following natural barriers to transportation.

Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George, said he liked the maps titled options A and B, for those reasons. He said Lake Powell and the Colorado River are also major waterways that are vital for southern Utah, “and to be able to have two Congress individuals to represent that water source is critical to the entire state of Utah.” 
According to Trende’s own analysis of his maps, all of his five comply with Proposition 4’s requirements which are the following criteria, in order of importance:

Equal population
Minimize city splits
Minimize county splits
Compactness
Contiguity and ease of transportation
Preserve traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest
Follow natural and geographic boundaries
Maximize boundary agreement

Map A splits three cities (North Salt Lake, Pleasant Grove and West Valley) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). 
Map B splits three cities (North Salt Lake, Provo and West Jordan) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). Map C splits three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). 
Map D splits three cities (Eagle Mountain, Layton and Taylorsville) and five counties (Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, Tooele and Wasatch). 
Map E splits two cities (Cottonwood Heights and Provo) and four counties (Salt Lake, Summit, Utah and Wasatch). 
Democrats’ proposed map, Magleby said, splits 13 cities and four counties (Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake and Utah). He said it was based off of a map drawn by the Independent Redistricting Commission back in 2021.

“When I’ve done my own analysis using the Harvard simulations, it falls well within the accepted range of what we would expect from a neutral redistricting process,” Magleby said. 
Several Republicans on the committee, however, expressed concerns about the number of city splits Magleby’s map would impose and expressed reluctance to support the map, arguing others would better adhere to Proposition 4’s criteria. 
Another map, however, not submitted by either of lawmakers’ dueling experts but by a Utahn, achieved even fewer city splits. 
Why not pick a map submitted by Utahns? 
Stuart Hepworth, a South Jordan resident, has submitted 14 maps for lawmakers to consider. One of his latest drafts would split zero cities and only three counties based on the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s map C. 
“This map outperforms all previously submitted maps (from myself, the legislature, or other members of the public) in complying with Prop 4’s redistricting criteria in the statutory order of priority,” Hepworth wrote with his submission. 
He told the committee that his map has the “bare minimum” county splits, splitting Salt Lake, Utah and “a tiny bit” of Weber county. 
“I followed the committee’s process in drawing the map, not viewing partisan data during the map’s creation,” Hepworth told the committee. “I believe this map is categorically superior to all five of Dr. Trende’s maps and following Prop 4’s criteria.” 
Sandall, however, noted that in the past Hepworth has drawn maps using Dave’s Redistricting online tool, which allows users to toggle views of partisan data. He pointed to a video Hepworth posted on YouTube earlier this month in which he demonstrated drawing a map in under six minutes. Hepworth acknowledged that map was drawn with a political data viewer turned on.

Another commenter, James Carter from Salt Lake City, urged lawmakers to choose a map drawn by members of the public — like from Hepworth — rather than one drawn by their chosen dueling experts. He said any statistics student “knows that there’s no such thing as an unbiased statistical analysis presentation.” 
“Every presentation of statistical analyses will include the motivations, at least, of the presenter. And the motivations that I’ve heard from both the majority and minority caucus, from opposing experts, has been fairly along the lines of ‘how far can we stretch our legal mandate to get what we want and stick it to the other guys,’” Carter said. 
In order to achieve a “fair, representative map” under Proposition 4, he urged the committee to “reject all six maps proposed today” and instead consider maps drawn by Hepworth or others “which have been drawn with fairness and with all of the requirements of Prop 4 in mind.” 
Sandall, however, indicated he had reservations about doing that, saying it’s “impossible to ascertain amongst all the maps that were drawn and submitted if any of them were drawn using political data in the timeframe that we have.
“It’s almost an impossible task,” he said. “Because that is our mandate under Prop 4, no political consideration can be made in drawing a map. And we would have to go in and depose any or all of the map drawers to find out if political data was used, and we just don’t have that time.”

Scams are nothing new – fraud has existed as long as human greed. What changes are the tools.
Scammers thrive on exploiting vulnerable, uninformed users, and they adapt to whatever technologies or trends dominate the moment. In 2025, that means AI, cryptocurrencies and stolen personal data are their weapons of choice.
And, as always, the duty, fear and hope of their targets provide openings. Today, duty often means following instructions from bosses or co-workers, who scammers can impersonate. Fear is that a loved one, who scammers also can impersonate, is in danger. And hope is often for an investment scheme or job opportunity to pay off.
 AI-powered scams and deepfakes

Artificial intelligence is no longer niche – it’s cheap, accessible and effective. While businesses use AI for advertising and customer support, scammers exploit the same tools to mimic reality, with disturbing precision.
Criminals are using AI-generated audio or video to impersonate CEOs, managers or even family members in distress. Employees have been tricked into transferring money or leaking sensitive data. Over 105,000 such deepfake attacks were recorded in the U.S. in 2024, costing more than US$200 million in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Victims often cannot distinguish synthetic voices or faces from real ones.
Fraudsters are also using emotional manipulation. The scammers make phone calls or send convincing AI-written texts posing as relatives or friends in distress. Elderly victims in particular fall prey when they believe a grandchild or other family member is in urgent trouble. The Federal Trade Commission has outlined how scammers use fake emergencies to pose as relatives.
 Cryptocurrency scams

Crypto remains the Wild West of finance — fast, unregulated and ripe for exploitation.
Pump-and-dump scammers artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency through hype on social media to lure investors with promises of huge returns – the pump – and then sell off their holdings – the dump – leaving victims with worthless tokens.
Pig butchering is a hybrid of romance scams and crypto fraud. Scammers build trust over weeks or months before persuading victims to invest in fake crypto platforms. Once the scammers have extracted enough money from the victim, they vanish.
Scammers also use cryptocurrencies as a means of extracting money from people in impersonation scams and other forms of fraud. For example, scammers direct victims to bitcoin ATMs to deposit large sums of cash and convert it to the untraceable cryptocurrency as payment for fictitious fines.
 Phishing, smishing, tech support and jobs

Old scams don’t die; they evolve.
Phishing and smishing have been around for years. Victims are tricked into clicking links in emails or text messages, leading to malware downloads, credential theft or ransomware attacks. AI has made these lures eerily realistic, mimicking corporate tone, grammar and even video content.
Tech support scams often start with pop-ups on computer screens that warn of viruses or identity theft, urging users to call a number. Sometimes they begin with a direct cold call to the victim. Once the victim is on a call with the fake tech support, the scammers convince victims to grant remote access to their supposedly compromised computers. Once inside, scammers install malware, steal data, demand payment or all three.
Fake websites and listings are another current type of scam. Fraudulent sites impersonating universities or ticket sellers trick victims into paying for fake admissions, concerts or goods.
One example is when a website for “Southeastern Michigan University” came online and started offering details about admission. There is no such university. Eastern Michigan University filed a complaint that Southeastern Michigan University was copying its website and defrauding unsuspecting victims.
The rise of remote and gig work has opened new fraud avenues.
Victims are offered fake jobs with promises of high pay and flexible hours. In reality, scammers extract “placement fees” or harvest sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers and bank details, which are later used for identity theft.
 How you can protect yourself

Technology has changed, but the basic principles remain the same: Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders, and enter personal information only if you are sure that the website is legitimate. Avoid using third-party apps or links. Legitimate businesses have apps or real websites of their own.
Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. It provides security against stolen passwords. Keep software updated to patch security holes. Most software allows for automatic update or warns about applying a patch.
Remember that a legitimate business will never ask for personal information or a money transfer. Such requests are a red flag.
Relationships are a trickier matter. The state of California provides details on how people can avoid being victims of pig butchering.
Technology has supercharged age-old fraud. AI makes deception virtually indistinguishable from reality, crypto enables anonymous theft, and the remote-work era expands opportunities to trick people. The constant: Scammers prey on trust, urgency and ignorance. Awareness and skepticism remain your best defense.

(Photo: Getty Images)No one understands the partnership between the earth and its people better than those who steward the land. But for generations, farmers in the Volunteer State could not make direct sales to the public of temperature-controlled foods or canned goods.
That changed in 2022 when state lawmakers passed the Tennessee Food Freedom Act. The bill allowed farmers and other cottage-food producers to sell certain homemade, nonperishable foods, including baked goods and jams, with no need for inspection or licensing.  
Recently, the Tennessee House of Representatives expanded Tennessee’s cottage-food laws with the passage of HB130, enabling Tennessee farmers and food entrepreneurs to legally sell homemade foods that include perishable foods such as dairy, eggs and poultry. 
“This gives small producers more flexibility to meet the growing demand for local, fresh and prepared foods,” says bill sponsor Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican.
The bill does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk and other unpasteurized dairy products.
“We trust each other with food in our communities,” said Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican who sponsored the Food Freedom Act. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Within the past year, lawsuits have been filed against a Florida dairy farm found by the Florida State Health Department to have sold unpasteurized dairy products linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The cases include a pregnant mother who consumed raw milk, became sick and lost her unborn baby.
Elizabeth Stuart has farmed her Crossing Creeks Farm in Shelbyville for the past 12 years, practicing regenerative farming to raise beef cattle, pigs, turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs.
Though the farm has a commercial kitchen, Stuart realizes the importance of the Food Freedom Act for those farms that do not.
“We believe that the Food Freedom Act is an important asset to Tennessee farmers and artisans,” she says. “For example, farmers who have a bumper crop of vegetables, or chicken, meat or eggs, now have the ability to turn that into a value-added product instead of it becoming waste. This increases the amount of local food sources within the state.”
The welfare of local farmers and food entrepreneurs is at the heart of the bil, saud Reneau.
“This bill is about freedom and opportunity,” Reneau said, adding that the new legislation negates the need for inspections and commercial licensing that costs food producers nearly $500. 
“Tennessee families love buying directly from people they know and trust, and small farms and home kitchens want the ability to serve their communities without unnecessary red tape,” she said.
Reneau compares the Food Freedom Act to shared community meals, such as pot-luck dinners with friends and neighbors.
“We already trust each other with food in our communities,” she said. “This simply extends that same trust to local farmers and food entrepreneurs so more of them can start businesses or expand what they offer.”
The Food Freedom Act enables farmers and small-food producers to diversify their offerings, from soups and stews to casseroles with perishable ingredients, such as poultry and dairy, giving the “little guy” a fairer chance to compete or get started in  the food business. 
The idea is to create an incubator of sorts, a stepping stone that may lead to commercial operations in larger cities, while giving those in rural areas with no access to commercial kitchens a viable option to sell locally.
The 2022 Food Freedom Act enabled farmers to sell shelf-stable items requiring no refrigeration or special handling. Now, prepared chicken, such as rotisserie chicken, soups and pot pie, plus butter, eggs, yogurts, hard cheeses and kefir can be sold directly to consumers.
Bird Fork Farm is a Certified Naturally Grown small seed-to-bottle apothecary farm in Dunlap. The farm produces organically grown vegetables, fruits and herbs in addition to locally grown or foraged teas, spices, extracts, syrups, body care products, ferments and vinegars. 
Alysia Leon of Bird Fork says the Food Freedom Act has allowed her farm to cut down on food waste and offer farm-fresh products year-round.  While the farm does not produce meat and dairy products, updates allowing the sale of temperature-controlled foods opens revenue resources once denied Tennessee farmers.
“We know this update has allowed other farmer friends the ability to expand their operations,” Leon says. “It cuts down on food waste to create value-added products, and it gives farmers the benefit of the doubt that they are doing things the right way.”
The bill has received overwhelming approval from cottage-food producers, Reneau said.
“Many have told me they’ve been waiting years to sell more of the foods they already make at home, but costs and regulations have prevented that. Customers are just as excited,” she said. “They want more local choices and more ways to support their neighbors. 
“It’s truly a win-win for producers and consumers, and I hope Tennessee’s Food Freedom Act becomes a model for other states.”

(Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)Former Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, in what may have been one of her first public appearances since getting off home detention, talked about the need for police reform and made her own case to an appreciative audience Wednesday in Washington.
Mosby was part of a panel of lawmakers, lawyers and advocates at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference who talked about flaws with public safety in America and envisioned a better future.
The audience was generally receptive to the panel’s arguments that despite some improvements, the criminal justice system and policing in America still has room for improvement. But they were especially enthusiastic about Mosby, who was convicted on federal charges that she says were brought because she pursued convictions of Baltimore police officers.
Audience members chimed in with a “That’s right!” or  “Yeah!” as Mosby answered panel questions, and the end of each of her answers was met with an eruption of applause and cheers. Peoplel swarmed around her as the panel concluded, eager to snap a picture with or have a chat with the former attorney.
Mosby said she was not surprised to be invited to speak on the panel, saying in a brief interview afterwards that, “There was a lot of change enacted as a direct result of what happened in Baltimore City.”

“Baltimore was at the forefront of this progressive movement,” she said.
The panel discussed the nationwide protests and reform efforts that followed the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore — a crisis Mosby came face-to-face with as the city’s top prosecutor.
The two high-profile deaths in police custody sparked national conversations about police accountability.
“Both cities remind us that public safety is not just about officers on patrol or prosecutions in the courtroom, but about trust, community and a shared belief that every person deserves equal justice under the law,” said Rep. Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), the panel moderator.
Gray’s death was four months into Mosby’s term in office. She and her team worked to charge the officers involved in Gray’s death and the U.S. Justice Department exposed the police department’s discriminatory practices — leading to nationwide reform, Mosby said at the panel. Those reforms included things like body cameras, de-escalation policies and dashboard cameras, she said.
Mosby said that prosecutors were not prosecuting police, and there was a lack of accountability in America at the time. She got death threats and became a “target of the same system I represented” following the prosecution of the officers, she said on the panel.
Bell also described Mosby as a target while asking a question about how prosecuting cases can change public safety and justice perspectives.
Mosby is on three years of supervised release — with one of those being the year of home confinement that concluded in June 2025 — for perjury convictions related to the purchase of two Florida homes.
She said the federal government was not able to find anything after interrogating her neighbors, family, friends, hairdresser and her children’s dance instructor.
“I had no idea that they could come back and say that I am now going to be the target of a criminal investigation for a statute that has never been legally used against anyone else in this country up to this day, and for a vague statute that has never been legally defined by neither Congress nor the IRS,” Mosby said during the panel discussion.

Jason Armstrong, a retired Ferguson police chief who was appointed five years after Brown’s death, spoke on the panel about seeing the payoff and community impact from working to create a “culture of accountability.”
“Like Mrs. Mosby said, the sacrifices that I’m having to put forth in this are worth something,” he said.
Panelist Justin Hansford, a Howard University law professor and the director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, also referenced Mosby in one of his answers, emphasizing her point that “the justice system isn’t just.”
Mosby said that the federal government opened an investigation on her two months after publishing this Washington Post op-ed that criticized President Donald Trump’s decision and threats to send federal law enforcement officers to cities around the country in July 2020.
“They did it because they wanted to get me out of office, and they were successful,” she said. “Justice is always worth the price paid for its pursuit. I would not do anything different.”

Abigail Salisbury said.","State Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny) speaks during a House Appropriations Committee budget hearing with Community and Economic Development Secretary Rick Siger on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2025. (Photo courtesy of House Democrats)On Monday, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. held a press conference claiming a link between Tylenol consumption during pregnancy and autism. It was the latest development in an effort promised in the early days of the Trump administration – to find a cause of what Kennedy has described as an autism “epidemic.”
While the claims drew immediate blowback from members of the scientific community, the way Trump and Kennedy have discussed autism over the past few months has also brought pushback from autistic people and their advocates in Pennsylvania and across the nation.
For example, in April, while announcing an initiative to study the environmental factors that may contribute to autism, Kennedy said the condition is a “tragedy” that “destroys families.” 
“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem,” Kennedy said.
In a recorded cabinet meeting last month, Trump said, “autism is such a tremendous horror show,” while teasing the recent announcement. 
Trump and RFK Jr. are making claims about autism. What do medical experts say?

Two state lawmakers in the commonwealth, both Democrats, are openly autistic. They have decried the administration’s approach to addressing the developmental disorder.
Rep. Jessica Benham (D-Allegheny) was the first lawmaker elected to the House with a publicly known diagnosis. She has been alarmed by the administration’s language when discussing autism. 
“This is not the first time that autism has been politicized by this administration, and we cannot allow the whims of non-experts to determine best courses of medical care,” she said in a statement to the Capital-Star. “It’s critically important that pregnant women continue to listen to real experts and make healthcare decisions in consultation with their doctors.”
Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), chair of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, is also autistic. She criticized how Trump and Kennedy characterized people with the condition. 
“I just became a little bit disgusted with the language they were using to describe people who have autism, as well as the experience of their families,” Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), chair of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, told the Capital-Star. “Imagine you are a child with an autism diagnosis. Let’s say your parents do get divorced, or you have some sort of family issue, what does that do to you when you’re hearing that — when you’re hearing you destroyed your family and you’re the cause of everybody’s problems?”

While some studies have found a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism, many experts have called them inconclusive and said they haven’t established a causal relationship. That’s in part because it’s unclear whether Tylenol, or the underlying conditions and symptoms it was being taken to alleviate, may have contributed. 
Many doctors also agree that an untreated fever during pregnancy can be more harmful to a fetus than Tylenol, which medical professionals say has fewer risks than many alternative treatments.
Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement the announcement was not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and “dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children.”
“It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data” he added.

Last April, Benham, who is also a member of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, shared her concerns at a press conference. It was shortly after the National Institutes of Health under Kennedy announced plans to conduct a large study into the causes of autism. 
“RFK Jr.’s comments are offensive,” she said at a press conference in April. “They’re offensive to folks on the spectrum and they’re offensive to those who love us. We need more support and services for autistic people, not insults about how we contribute to society.”
It was reported the study would involve the collection of private medical records from federal and commercial databases, effectively amounting to an autism registry.
Kennedy also hired David Geier to look into the links between vaccines and autism. Geier had previously been involved in retracted studies linking vaccine ingredients and autism, and was disciplined in Maryland for practicing medicine without a license. 
“To weaponize autism research for political purposes is inappropriate and offensive,” Benham said. “We do not need fear-mongering tactics. We do not need scare tactics.”










It’s not great when the president of the United States acts as if a condition that you have is a scourge or a plague on society.


– Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), who is autistic.


While Salisbury said she supports comprehensive research into the condition, including potential environmental causes, she found Trump and Kennedy’s language alarming. She said she was diagnosed after receiving a negative review at a job that raised issues characteristic of an autism diagnosis, like struggling to make eye contact.
“It’s not great when the president of the United States acts as if a condition that you have is a scourge or a plague on society,” she said. “I understand that I have a sort of privilege, because I’m someone who can get elected to the statehouse, or to borough council before that, or run a law practice. There are many families out there who have children who are non-verbal and will never achieve the kind of dreams that their parents have for them, but that does not mean those children don’t have value as human beings.”

Salisbury has called for lawmakers to convene a panel of experts to discuss what the best available data and mainstream scientific consensus says about the causes of autism.
The request comes as officials in Pennsylvania and around the country have raised alarms about potentially politicized data or public health recommendations coming out of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Kennedy.
Last month, in a break from precedent, Gov. Josh Shapiro asked the State Board of Pharmacy to vote to bypass the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 
Every member of the federal panel was fired and replaced by Kennedy, with some of the new appointees having a history of vocal vaccine skepticism. Before taking office, Kennedy himself was a leader in the growing anti-vaccine movement, suggesting a link between immunizations and autism, despite widespread scientific consensus to the contrary.
Pennsylvania has also joined a public health coalition of northeastern states that seeks to make vaccine recommendations and prepare for possible emergencies, amid distrust in the direction of HHS.
While Shapiro has yet to address the claims linking autism and Tylenol consumption during pregnancy directly, on Wednesday, Shapiro wrote in a post on the social media platform X, “Here in Pennsylvania, we support our [intellectual disability/Autism (ID/A)] community. We’re going to continue to follow the science and facts to inform our public health guidance — all while investing in our direct support professionals and ensuring that folks in the ID/A community receive the care that they deserve.”
Salisbury shared a similar sentiment.
“Autistic individuals and our families deserve to know that our lawmakers are listening to data, to doctors and to lived experiences,” she said.
Andrew Nixon, the communications director for HHS, pushed back on claims the agency was being politicized under Kennedy.
“Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies,” Nixon said in a statement. “ACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”

As it stands, autism is thought to be primarily genetic, though environmental factors during pregnancy can play a role in fetal development.
Kennedy and Trump have both noted a significant increase in the prevalence of autism diagnoses over the last several decades, from around one in 151 children in 2000 to one in 31 in 2022, according to CDC. OIt’s not clear whether the condition itself has become more common.
Autism has become more widely known and understood by parents as well as doctors. Moreover, the criteria for diagnosing autism has changed, coming to encompass more mild forms of the condition, once known as Asperger’s syndrome.
“I think it’s important, from my perspective, to tell parents that if your child has autism it’s not your fault,” Salisbury said. I think when you start telling people, ‘Oh you took Tylenol, therefore your child has autism,’ you’re blaming. That opens the door for people to look at a family with a child with autism and think, ‘Oh that’s your fault. You did that.’ That’s cruel, and that’s wrong, and we should not be blaming.”
On Wednesday, a coalition of leading autism and disability advocacy organizations released a statement condemning Trump and Kennedy’s approach.
“Autistic people deserve respect and support. There are many policy and program changes HHS could pursue that would materially improve the lives of autistic people and our families,” the statement read. “The targeting of autism is part of a broader initiative led by Secretary Kennedy to undermine public health and well-being, undermine trust in science, and to advance harmful, ableist beliefs that make all of us less safe.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/034_02182025_Approps_DCED_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 20:57:26.855244

In the 2025 legislative session, Klimesh was chairman for the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, in addition to serving as vice chair for the Local Government Committee and for the Health and Human Services Appropriations subcommittee.
Whitver announced Sept. 16 that he was retiring from the leadership position, which he has held since 2018, and would not seek reelection in 2026. The 45-year-old Grimes resident was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2024, and has said treatment was ongoing.
In a statement Wednesday, Klimesh thanked Whitver for his time leading the Senate GOP caucus.
“Leading a deep and talented group of senators is an honor, and with that honor comes a great responsibility,” Klimesh said. “I want to thank Jack for his years of service, his exceptional example as a leader, and most of all for his friendship. I can’t imagine anyone leaving behind bigger shoes to fill.”
As leader, Klimesh said he looks forward to “continuing to implement our agenda to reduce taxes, making it more affordable to live in Iowa, reduce barriers to work and invest in this state, expand the economy, and return Iowa schools to their status as the best in the country.”
Gov. Kim Reynolds congratulated Klimesh in a statement Wednesday. “Sen. Klimesh’s influence in the senate has steadily grown over the last four years, and I’m confident in his ability to successfully lead the Senate,” she said.
“I look forward to working with him in the upcoming legislative session to further our conservative agenda and build upon our years of success,” Reynolds said.
Iowa Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, also congratulated Klimesh Wednesday, while thanking Whitver for his service in the Legislature.
“I am hopeful that we can find ways to work together to deliver for and truly improve the lives of all Iowans in the bipartisan manner they expect from us,” Weiner said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LINCOLN — The former executive director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission faces seven felony charges, including some that allege he deprived Nebraskans of his honest work as a public official by letting two Lincoln strip clubs give him cash, lap dances, sexual favors and free drinks.
He visited often enough that employees tallied the amount his visits pulled from the cash register on sticky notes left for their bosses that they labeled “COB” for the cost of the clubs doing business, according to a federal indictment of the state official unsealed this week.
Part of the state official’s job was to help the commission dole out, discipline and rescind Nebraska liquor licenses. That role included weighing in after police investigations of rival Omaha strip clubs the indictment alleges the state official shared with the co-owner of the Lincoln clubs and looking up dancers in law enforcement databases. And the indictment alleges he demanded a total of $65,000 from one bar owner to protect a liquor license.
The grand jury charged former commission director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe with three counts of honest services fraud — the charge that means a public official or employee depriving the people of an official’s honest work — one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, two counts of wire fraud and one count of extortion. 
It charged a co-owner of Lincoln strip clubs The Office and The Night Before Lounge, Brent Zywiec, with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. All are felonies carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison. All must still be proven in court.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who attended a news conference at the FBI’s Omaha office with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to announce the indictment, said it should serve as a warning to anybody who would seek personal gain from public service.
“Nebraskans expect that their public servants give them honest services, that they act with integrity and follow the oath of office they swear to uphold,” Hilgers said of Rupe, who served as executive director from 2004 until June 2025. “That’s not what happened here.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a statement Wednesday, expressed disappointment at the “failure of leadership at the Liquor Control Commission.” He said he would do “everything in my power” to make sure the agency, which is run independently of his administration, meets public expectations “going forward.” 
“The conduct alleged in the indictment … falls completely short of what Nebraskans expect of officials placed in positions of public trust,” Pillen said.
Rupe served almost 10 years as an assistant attorney general prior to joining the commission. He did not immediately return calls seeking comment. One former number had been changed. The other went straight to voicemail. The Liquor Control Commission had suspended him without pay from his $130,596-a-year job in May after a search warrant was served.
Liquor Control Commission Chair Bruce Bailey of Lincoln had said in May that Rupe’s alleged offenses related to his “fitness and ability” to serve and required an immediate suspension. No new information had been available until this week.
The shake-up at the Liquor Commission could have impacts beyond liquor cases, because the members of the board also serve on the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and the two commissions began sharing funds after Rupe’s departure.
A woman who answered the phone at The Office Gentlemen’s Club in Lincoln said the club would have no comment. One person at the club said Zywiec had been “suspended.” No one immediately answered the Examiner’s calls to The Night Before Lounge. Efforts to reach Zywiec were unsuccessful Wednesday.
The indictment alleges that payments and services were offered at the clubs from January 2022 through May 2025. Among the gifts offered and accepted, it said, were free entry into bars that usually charge $20 cover fees, free drinks and cash to cover free lap dances, free VIP dances and services that included oral sex.
A single private dance at the club can cost about $100 for three songs, while a turn in the VIP lounge can cost up to $500. The feds say at least one surveillance video investigators secured showed Rupe receiving sexual favors. Some videos of people in compromising positions were saved to the owner’s iCloud account, the indictment says.
Rupe, in addition to sharing sensitive information with Zywiec about law enforcement investigations into rival clubs, also ignored violations he saw occurring in the Lincoln clubs, the indictment alleges. 
Text messages between Zywiec and an unnamed cohort who is likely cooperating with the feds show the two had developed coded language to speak about visiting the club, the indictment alleges. They used the term “team players” to discuss whether a particular dancer might be willing to offer favors, it adds. The two used the words “book” or “papers” to discuss cash, authorities allege.
“Like I said if I don’t know em. Know em i can’t endorse em,” Zywiec allegedly wrote in one text message exchange. “But that shouldn’t stop you.”
Rupe replied, the documents allege: “You know me. Always on the lookout for team players.”
In another text exchange, Zywiec and an unnamed co-conspirator discussed a “new blond” who “just took Hobie to vip.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office is requesting a jury trial in Lincoln.

Michelle Lujan Grisham during the State of the State speech on Jan. 20, 2025. Haaland, who is running in 2026 to be the state’s next governor, wrote to the University of New Mexico this week urging higher wages for resident doctors. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland this week sent a letter to the governing board of New Mexico’s flagship university urging it to increase salaries for incoming resident doctors and preserve anti-discrimination language in ongoing union negotiations.
The University of New Mexico’s contract with the resident physicians union, called the Committee of Interns and Residents, expired on Aug. 31. While the contract remains in effect during negotiations, the union and university are still negotiating the levels of pay for residents at the state’s sole academic medical center.
“At a time when our state is grappling with the second-worst physician shortage in the nation, with a third of our physicians expected to retire by 2030, failure to invest in resident physicians now is a decision with long-term consequences,” Haaland wrote in the Sept. 23 letter to the UNM Board of Regents.
Physician shortages are projected to impact states across the U.S. in the next few years, but New Mexico is ranked to have the second-highest rate per capita, according to 2020 data published by the National Institutes of Health.
Resident physicians are doctors who have graduated medical school and are now in training to specialize in their fields of choice—often for relatively low pay and long hours.
Rupali Gautam, a third-year resident training in pediatrics and the regional vice president of the UNM resident physician union chapter, says enacting competitive salaries and benefits for new doctors will help address the state’s shrinking pool of physicians. According to a 2024 Think New Mexico study, the state has seen a 30% decline in primary doctors in recent years.
“With the growing physician shortage in New Mexico, the best way to recruit residents is to provide those incentives for them to apply here,” Gautam said.
In her letter, Haaland contended that UNM has the lowest-paid residency salaries in the Southwest Region, with a starting stipend of $65,550 for a first-year student. The ​​American Association of Medical Colleges data from 2024 shows mean stipends for first-year residents at western schools (New Mexico Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) was just over $75,000.
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center disputed that New Mexico’s pay for residents is one of the lowest in the region. Chris Ramirez, the director of communications for UNM Health Sciences Center, supplied data from other universities, in Utah, Arizona and Texas. Ramirez noted that the third-year resident’s salary, which he called “more representative,” is on par with the national median of 10 other area universities and the national median from the American Association of Medical Colleges.
Ramirez said UNM Hospitals appreciated Haaland’s letter.
“We are always happy to keep our community leaders informed on the issues affecting the University and its constituents, while also making sure we are compliant with all applicable laws governing confidentiality and collective bargaining,” Ramirez said in a statement.

The University has also proposed removing specific anti-discrimination language in the contract’s non-discrimination clause, Gautam said, pointing to recent efforts by the federal government to ban “diversity, equity and inclusion,” at universities.
“I think that’s because of the Trump administration pushback that a lot of institutions are getting from a federal level if they are using the words diversity and inclusion,” Gautam said.
Ramirez said he could not speak to UNM’s position on contract negotiations.
“It is unlawful for either party to publicly discuss any terms of the proposals made by either party before it is ratified by the parties,” he wrote in response to Source NM’s inquiry. “However, UNM and UNM Hospital are committed to ensuring compliance with state and federal anti-discrimination laws.”
Haaland said removing the language jeopardizes “a safe, inclusive and equitable environment,” for not only new doctors but also their patients.
“UNM’s mission in providing care is rooted in serving Native American, Hispanic, and other underserved people of Bernalillo County. That mission depends on fostering a workforce that reflects the people it serves and can provide care that is not only clinically sound but culturally competent,” she wrote.
In a statement, Haaland said New Mexico is “uniquely vulnerable to Trump’s attacks on our healthcare,” noting concerns about rising health insurance premiums.
“If we’re serious about lowering costs and expanding access, we have to make smart moves like paying our medical residents. It keeps doctors local to the area at a time when we cannot afford to fall farther behind,” she said.
A voicemail for Board of Regents Chair Paul Blanchard had not been returned as of Wednesday afternoon.. An emailed request for comment to Ben Cloutier, the head of communications and marketing at UNM, to whom Ramirez referred board questions, also remained pending.
Gautam said she was grateful for Haaland’s letter lending attention to the negotiations and said the union wants to reach a resolution with the university to address the physician shortage.
“Patients traveling to other states to get their care are going months, even up to past a year,to get specialty care within different fields,” she said. “I’m a pediatrics resident and a lot of our pediatric specialists are seeing patients months to years out from their initial referral — that’s not great.”

ABC stations owned by the Nexstar and Sinclair corporations took Kimmel off the air last week on the same day the network suspended him for comments that angered supporters of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those stations, including Nexstar-owned WTNH in New Haven, kept him off the air Tuesday, when ABC lifted the suspension. The unusual dispute attracted the attention of U.S. senators, who said they wanted to investigate the relationship between the affiliates and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Kimmel returned with no apologies, but in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, the host said that he was not trying to joke about the assassination. He also paid tribute to Kirk’s widow.
And it got a large audience, with ABC reporting nearly 6.3 million people tuned in to the broadcast alone, despite the blackouts in many markets. As is often the case with late-night hosts’ monologues, there was a larger audience online, with more than 15 million people watching Kimmel’s opening remarks on YouTube by Wednesday evening. ABC says more than 26 million people watched Kimmel’s return on social media, including YouTube.
Typically, he gets about 1.8 million viewers each night on television. The numbers released by ABC do not include viewership from streaming services.
A spokesman for Nexstar said Wednesday that Kimmel will continue to be preempted from its stations while the company evaluates his show. Together, the Nexstar and Sinclair groups account for about a quarter of ABC’s affiliates, many in smaller cities such as Nashville, Tennessee; Lubbock, Texas; or Topeka, Kansas.
“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at the (ABC parent) Walt Disney Co., with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” Nexstar said.
Some of Nexstar’s Connecticut audience is planning a protest outside the ABC affiliate WTNH in New Haven Thursday. Connecticut Citizen Action Group, the organizer behind the protest, said in a statement Wednesday, “This is not just about one late-night show; it is about the dangers of media consolidation, censorship, and the growing impediment to free speech caused by right-wing corporate control of information.”
Dispute highlights relationship between networks and local stations
The dispute focused attention on the business relationships between television networks and the local stations that carry their programming. In the past, local stations occasionally balked at airing a network show, but it was usually an individual market or two worried about pushing boundaries in language or sexual content, said Ted Harbert, a former top executive at ABC and CBS.
What’s different this time is groups that have gobbled up multiple stations acting collectively on content for largely political reasons.
“This is how much the country’s political divisions have seeped their way into something that has been, for the last 50 or 75 years, a relatively orderly business,” Harbert said.
Leadership of ownership groups is generally more conservative than the media and entertainment figures on the stations they broadcast, said Ken Basin, author of “The Business of Television.” Both Sinclair, with conservative political content, and Nexstar have reason to curry favor with the Trump administration, he said. Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval for the purchase of a rival, he said.
“I worry that this is not going to be the only dispute of this nature in the years ahead,” Basin said.
It’s possible that Disney could play hardball if negotiations on Kimmel’s return drag on, such as threatening to withhold other ABC programming — even the “nuclear option” of football games. Its unclear how the affiliate agreements are worded.
But Matt Dolgin, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research Service, said he doubts the dispute reaches that point. The station groups have a far less diversified business portfolio than Disney, and the expiration of affiliate agreements next year looms as a deadline, he said. They have few good options if they lose ABC programming.
“From a business perspective, the best course on this issue (for Disney) is to stay above the fray,” Dolgin said. “The dollars associated with this show are very low.”
As they climb, the stunning number of YouTube views of Kimmel’s monologue serve to make television broadcasting less important, hurting the negotiating position of the stations.
For the station groups, the biggest goal should be to negotiate their way out of this — while finding a way to save face, he said. Sinclair initially took a strong stance, saying Kimmel would not return to its stations without apologizing to Kirk’s widow and donating money to Kirk’s political organization. That’s not likely to happen.
Kimmel was at risk of losing show entirely
Last week, Kimmel seemed to be in real danger of losing his show entirely until advocates for free speech protested, including many who canceled subscriptions for Disney services.
“The backlash was stronger than they expected, stronger than I expected,” Basin said. “There was a sense of despair within the industry that this was a ‘canary in a coal mine’ moment.”
Four Democratic senators said late Tuesday that they wanted to look into what happened with the station groups.
“If Nexstar or Sinclair traded the censorship of a critic of the administration for official acts by the Trump administration, your companies are not only complicit in an alarming trampling of free speech but also risk running afoul of anti-corruption law,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen wrote to the companies.
On Wednesday, another group of senators led by California Democrat Adam Schiff said they wanted to question FCC Chairman Brendan Carr about “implicit threats” made to Disney over Kimmel.
In his monologue Tuesday, Kimmel tried to thread the needle between both sides in a raw political moment, and seemed to realize its difficulty.
“I don’t think what I’m going to say is going to make much of a difference,” he said. “If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind.”
Within hours, many proved his point. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organization that Kirk founded that is now headed by his widow, posted on X that Kimmel’s monologue was “not good enough.”
In another corner of social media, comic Ben Stiller posted that it was a “brilliant monologue.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana students can now qualify for the TOPS scholarship by taking a conservative alternative to ACT and the SAT exams, but it is not currently accepted for admissions to any public university in Louisiana. 
The Classical Learning Test, or CLT for short, evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents that “had a lasting influence on Western culture,” according to the CLT website.
Its primary proponents are conservative educators. In addition to Louisiana, Oklahoma accepts the CLT for qualification for its version of TOPS. 
The Classical Learning Test was launched in 2015 by Classic Learning Initiatives. It is accepted for admissions primarily by private Christian schools and a small number of public schools, primarily in Republican-controlled states, including every state university in Florida. 
The exam is still relatively obscure, but it has recently received high-profile attention when U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved it for acceptance into the U.S. military academies. 
Earlier this year, the Louisiana Legislature approved the CLT as an alternative for qualifying for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, which provides tuition assistance for qualifying Louisiana students. Last month, the Louisiana Board of Regents approved the CLT equivalent to the ACT scores needed to qualify for each level of TOPS. The equivalencies scores are only good for TOPS qualification, as the CLT is not used for admissions at the vast majority of Louisiana universities.
Earlier this month, a billboard went up in Baton Rouge advertising the Classical Learning Test to students. The display ad refers to one of LSU’s football rivals, the University of Alabama.
“Bama isn’t your team. ACT isn’t your test,” the purple and gold billboard along Interstate 10 near College Drive reads. “Louisiana students take the CLT. Now accepted for TOPS.”
The billboard discourages students from taking the ACT, which in Louisiana is the most popular of the two standardized college admissions tests commonly taken by high school students before they apply for college. But students should know the CLT is not an acceptable alternative for admissions in most cases. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University in Pineville accepts the CLT for admissions. Students seeking admissions to any public university or any of the other private universities in the state will need to submit an ACT or SAT score. 
Critics of the Classical Learning Test argue it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
The Iowa Board of Regents released a review of the exam and found no peer-review research supporting the test’s ability to predict student outcomes and subsequently recommended the exam not be used for admissions. 
Louisiana high school students were able to qualify for TOPS using the Classical Learning Test starting with the current fall semester. So far, just one student has applied for TOPS using their CLT score, Board of Regents spokesman Chris Yandle said. 
The Louisiana Legislature approved the CLT exam for TOPS with little discussion earlier this year as an amendment to a bill creating a new TOPS award level for high-achieving students. Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, sponsored the amendment. Crews said Jeremy Tate, founder and CEO of Classical Learning Initiatives, asked him to do so. 
Classical Learning Initiatives is a for-profit company, as is Nexus Capital Management, which purchased the nonprofit American College Testing last year. The College Board, which administers the SAT, is a nonprofit organization.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana’s Liz Murrill and 16 other Republican state attorneys general have signed a letter to college administrators warning them not to impose a “tax on free speech” by asking student organizations to pay high security fees for controversial speakers. 
The letter, led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, said that in the wake of the shooting death of ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month, reports have circulated that colleges have used his death as justification to shut down free speech with exorbitant security fees. The letter did not cite any specific examples. 
The attorneys general referred to prohibitive security fees as the “assassin’s veto,” a play on the “heckler’s veto,” a phenomenon in which a controversial speaker’s right to free speech is curtailed by an overwhelming negative response. 
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the attorneys general wrote. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.” 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students with opposing viewpoints. 
Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley was the first stop on a tour that would have included an Oct. 27 visit to LSU. Turning Point USA, the conservative student organization Kirk founded, has announced the tour would go on without Kirk. The LSU stop will feature Gov. Jeff Landry and Allie Beth Stuckey, a conservative Christian podcaster. 
Colleges and universities have at times struggled to balance their obligations to protect free speech with their duty to student safety. Universities often have small campus police departments that are stretched thin when high-profile, controversial speakers come to campus. 
The AGs’ letter asks schools to confirm their facility use and security fee policies are viewpoint neutral and asks them to develop standards for applying fees. 
“There should be clear protocols for event approval and protecting speakers, ensuring security is the responsibility of the institution rather than a financial barrier on disfavored speech,” the letter reads. 
Courts have held that exorbitant security fees can violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees a right to free speech. A fee is especially dubious if it’s applied based on the content of the speech. 
For example, a federal judge last year blocked the University of New Mexico from requiring the school’s chapter of Turning Point to pay a $5,400 security fee to host a campus event featuring anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines. 
The AGs warned in their letter they would investigate all complaints made to their offices alleging universities are curtailing speech. 
Murrill and Bird were joined on the letter by Steve Marshall of Alabama, Stephen Cox of Alaska, Tim Griffin of Arkansas, James Utheimer of Florida, Chris Carr of Georgia, Todd Rokita of Indiana, Kris Kobach of Kansas, Andrew Bailey of Missouri, Austin Knudsen of Montana, Mike Hilgers of Nebraska, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, Alan Wilson of South Carolina, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, Ken Paxton of Texas and Derek Brown of Utah.

In a decades-long ministry to feed the hungry, the meals have rotated among five local churches, according to organizers. But that’s changing. Four of the churches have combined to form the new organization.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on Sept. 23, 2025.
Ask anyone involved with Montpelier’s community lunches and you’ll likely hear as much about community as you will about the free food. Four days a week, the lunches feature generous portions of hearty food, always with a vegetarian option. Anyone can come eat, no questions asked. Takeout is available. 
Amy, a guest at Trinity Church’s Sept. 10 lunch, sat with friends and bounced a baby on her lap. Amy said she was 50 days sober and just moved into an apartment. Before that, she’d been living outdoors for three years, she said. She comes to the meals almost every day they are available.
“I just come here and get lunch and enjoy the company of the community,” she said with a smile. 
In a decades-long ministry to feed the hungry, the meals have rotated among five local churches, according to organizers. But that’s changing. Four of the churches — Trinity Church, Christ Episcopal Church, Bethany Church and the Unitarian Church of Montpelier — have combined to form a new organization called the Community Table. (The fifth, St. Augustine’s Catholic Church, is still serving lunches on Fridays but has not joined the coalition.)
The aim: to open the program up to people who may not feel aligned with a church but do feel aligned with feeding neighbors, said Jay Voorhees, coordinating pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church. 
Becoming a separate organization will also allow the group to apply for federal nonprofit status and to bring organizers together for “cross-pollination,” said Nancy Reid, who volunteers on the Unitarian Church’s “Monday Team.” (Reid is also president of The Bridge’s board of directors.) 
How the meals are organized is changing, but the lunches themselves are not. They are served Monday through Thursday at Trinity (at 131 Main Street), where doors open around 8:30 a.m. for coffee and light breakfast. Guests are welcome to hang out there or return for lunch, which starts at 11:30 a.m. Last winter, when meals were served at Christ Church, that three-hour window turned the place into an unofficial warming space for those who had nowhere else to go in the cold. Staff members from Good Samaritan Haven joined church volunteers to help out. It’s unclear what will happen in the winter of 2025 and 2026.
The evolution of how the free weekday meals are organized started with the COVID-19 pandemic, said Theresa Lever, who coordinates Bethany Church’s “Wednesday Team.” 
Before COVID-19, Lever said, Bethany had big teams of volunteers, a crowd for lunch, and donations that totaled about $100 each week. “We were serving more than 100 people” per meal, she recalled. “It was people who needed that free meal, but it was also the workers who came from downtown. … The meter person would come on her break.”
Then COVID-19 hit. “Everything went outside,” Lever recalled. They and the other churches in town, which were all still offering lunches separately, switched to pre-made takeout. 
Then came the disastrous July 2023 flood, which left most of downtown Montpelier underwater and left only Christ Church with a working kitchen. But Lever says the volunteers didn’t miss a beat. All five churches started cooking meals out of Christ Church, serving meals outside at first, then moving into the church’s community room for indoor dining.
The churches kept their independence, even as they pinch-hit for each other when, say, a volunteer cook had to move on. Each church had its own shelf in Christ Church’s refrigerator and closet-sized pantry, each procured its own food through donations and purchases, and each brought its own team to cook and serve: Unitarians on Mondays, Bethany on Tuesdays, Trinity on Wednesdays, Christ Church on Thursdays, and St. Augustine’s on Fridays.
Meanwhile, Trinity’s flood repairs included an 18-month process of rewiring and moving its electrical service panel up from the basement, which made the kitchen unusable. Repairs were finished in June 2025, about the same time organizers decided to coalesce as the Community Table. Now the four churches use Trinity only, and what had been an effort of separate churches is united.
Despite a wealth of volunteer hours — Monday cook Albert Sabatini estimates it takes volunteers about 576 hours to serve 80 to 100 meals four days a week — donations help. Stephanie Krauss, coordinator of the Community Table and a Trinity member, puts the cost per meal at about $3.55, more than twice what it was five years ago, and half again what it was last year.
Some financial donations come from community members. A $965 grant — the Community Table’s first — recently came in from Hunger Mountain Co-op. 
Food donations come from the Just Basics, Inc. food pantry, the Vermont Food Bank (which also charges for some of its food), and Community Harvest of Central Vermont, Krauss said. Community members also donate baked goods and desserts to supplement the nutritious meals.
The Community Table is currently accepting donations through Christ Church, which has 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, until the group gets its own nonprofit designation. (Donations to the Community Table can be made out to Christ Church with “community lunch fund” on the memo line.) That should allow it to carry forward an already solid tradition many decades into the future, welcoming guests from all walks of life and continuing to strengthen the social fabric that makes up Montpelier.
Krauss said she doesn’t want to erase the fact that the churches have been serving the meals. 
“But the story, to me, is there’s a new way this is happening, which was created by the flood,” she explained. “(We are trying) to open it up to the community more. It’s not just a church thing anymore.”
Gloria Alexander, who works at Another Way, said she eats at the community lunches most days. 
Amid savory smells from the kitchen and the din of people chatting, Alexander said “It’s wonderful. It’s the community which I like. I think if I was well off, I would still enjoy coming here, because it’s the community, you know. It’s the sense of family that most people don’t really have.”

Kim Reynolds said Wednesday her administration’s efforts to implement “science of reading” and math education efforts have resulted in higher scores for Iowa students on national assessments.
Reynolds and school officials held a news conference to celebrate the recent gains for Iowa on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), used to rate student progress around the country. Reynolds said Iowa students’ scores have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency levels in reading, writing and math, and have exceeded previous levels in science.
Reynolds said these improvements showcase why she believes President Donald Trump and U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s plan to send funding directly to states instead of going through the federal Department of Education — a proposal opposed by many education groups — would better serve K-12 schools.

“That’s why we submitted the first-in-the-nation unified allocation plan to really align federal programs and resources to Iowa’s state and local education priorities, to bolster school improvement efforts informed by accountability and assessment and support school districts,” Reynolds said. “… With today’s good news, we’re proving that I think we’re up to the task, that we’re definitely on the right track, that we have put the infrastructure in place, that we really are ready and able to take that opportunity and continue strong partnership to move this state forward.”
Reynolds and Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow linked the NAEP score increases to measures signed into law on reading in 2024 and math in 2025 that provide support for schools, teachers and families that have students struggling in these subjects. The 2024 law focused on children in kindergarten through sixth grade who are not reading at grade-level proficiency, giving these students a personalized plan to assist them until they meet literacy benchmarks.
The most recent NAEP test scores show an 11% increase in reading proficiency among students who were in 3rd grade in the 2023-2024 school year when they were tested again as 4th graders in 2024-2025, according to state officials.
“And just three months ago, I signed the ‘Math Counts’ bill into law, which we believe will replicate our success in literacy,” Reynolds said. Because while math scores are increasing in elementary and middle school, our high schoolers are really lagging behind.”
The law signed this year takes a similar approach to mathematics instruction, providing early screening and targeted intervention strategies for K-12 students who are struggling with the subject, in addition to boosting math teaching resources for families and school staff.
The officials also said chronic absenteeism rates have fallen significantly in recent years. Snow said the average percentage of chronically absent students – defined as those who miss 10% or more of classes in a year – dropped 5.8 percentage points in the last year. That, combined with other improvements for schools in need of support and increased work-based learning attainment, show significant progress for Iowa student achievements, she said.
“Overall school performance is improving,” Snow said. “Schools in need of support are improving, early literacy is improving, science proficiency is improving, attendance is improving and work-based learning is growing. … Our continued commitment to evidence based practices. Instructional leadership and accountability is imperative, and we’re excited to build on this remarkable progress together.”
T.J. Schneckloth, superintendent of Davenport Community School District, said the education department and state Legislature’s work on addressing absenteeism has made a major impact in Davenport schools.
“Our chronic absenteeism has drastically reduced in Davenport, and a lot of that has to do with some of the teeth that’s put into that legislation,” Schneckloth said.
Senate File 2435, the state’s education appropriations bill in 2024, changed regulations regarding absenteeism and truancy for Iowa students, including having school districts notify county attorneys alongside parents and guardians when a student misses 10% of hours in a trimester, and sets up a procedure for creating an “absenteeism prevention plan” with parents and students. If a student misses 20% of nonexempt hours during a trimester or if they and their parents are found violating the agreed-upon plan, the county attorney is notified.
Schneckloth also said the law signed by Reynolds in April that required K-12 public school districts to adopt policies banning at minimum the use of cellphones during instructional periods beginning in the 2025-2026 school year has also had a major, positive impact.
When student representatives on the Davenport school board were asked about the cell phone policy, he said “you took you heard a sigh, because obviously kids would like to have their phones with them all the time.”
“But unanimously, all the way around, every one of those juniors and seniors said, ‘I’m more focused in class,’ and ‘I find, instead of going to my phone, I’ll start a conversation with person next to me,'” Schneckloth said. “And so that level of engagement is exactly what we hear when we travel around and talk to our businesses — ‘we want people show up and we want them to care while they’re there.'”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Attorneys were in court Wednesday as South Carolina’s elections agency continues to face challenges from two directions — a lawsuit over whether it should turn over voter information to the federal government and consecutive firings of its top directors.
Lawyers for a Calhoun County voter, the South Carolina Election Commission and Gov. Henry McMaster appeared before Judge Daniel Coble in the downtown Columbia courthouse to argue whether the governor should be allowed to take part in the lawsuit involving the personal data of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters.
The U.S. Department of Justice last month asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
South Carolina voter Anne Crook filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
The court appearance comes a day after the agency’s deputy director, Paige Salonich, was fired for placing a recording device in a room the state Election Commission’s governing board uses for meetings.
It was the second termination of a top election official in less than a week.
The commission fired Salonich after she was allegedly caught on tape placing the “unauthorized device,” according to a copy of a termination letter provided to the SC Daily Gazette through a public records request.
The letter, dated Monday, said Salonich’s action “raises serious concerns regarding trust, confidentiality and workplace integrity.”
She’s accused of leaving the recorder in the room Sept. 17. That’s the same day the commission voted 3-2 following a closed-door meeting to fire Howard Knapp, executive director since 2023, “out of a desire for new leadership.”
No termination documents were available in Knapp’s dismissal, said election commission spokesman John Catalano.
Salonich was initially put on unpaid leave the next day (Thursday).
SC Election Commission fires executive director

The State Law Enforcement Division has since opened an investigation into “allegations of wiretapping,” The State newspaper previously reported. SLED did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
While state law allows a person to record a conversation or public proceedings without notifying the other people involved, that person must be part of the conversation or in the room for the recording to be legal.
Salonich, whose salary was almost $142,000, is also accused of raising her voice to agency leadership, using profanity and disrupting the office the day of Knapp’s firing. According to witnesses, the letter said, that included “declaring that you were being ‘held hostage at you own (explicit language) job’ and ‘that you would never be a hostage in this (explicit language) place again.'”
The letter said her outburst “left other employees visibly shaken, created an unprofessional environment and undermined the commission’s ability to conduct business in an orderly and respectful manner.”
Salonich, who has worked at the state Election Commission since November 2021, tried to resign Monday but was told via email she was being terminated instead.
A lawyer representing Salonich did not respond to messages from the Gazette. Knapp also did not respond to a message.
Knapp, whose salary was $150,000, remains the subject of another ongoing investigation by SLED, agency spokeswoman Renee Wunderlich previously confirmed. In March 2024, SLED launched the investigation into unspecified allegations of misconduct at the request of the state attorney general’s office.
The commission has previously said the personnel issues are not related to “the conduct of any election in South Carolina.”
“The agency remains fully focused on administering upcoming elections and ensuring that South Carolina voters can continue to have confidence in the process,” Catalano said in a statement Wednesday.
SC can give voter data to Trump administration, state Supreme Court says

Meanwhile, Judge Coble is scheduled to hear more arguments Friday in the ongoing voter rolls case, as Crook’s lawyers seek to temporarily block the voter information release.
The state Supreme Court overturned on procedural issues a previous attempt to stop the information from being shared. Now, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is Crook’s attorney, is trying again.
The elections agency has yet to provide the requested data to the Department of Justice as it continues to negotiate a memorandum of understanding. The federal agency informed the election commission this week it expects to provide a draft agreement “soon,” Catalano said.
“Once we receive it, we will review it to ensure consistency with South Carolina law and to address the technical details of the proposed data transfer,” Catalano said.
Coble also has yet to rule on whether the governor will be allowed to join the case against the agency.
Arguing against the governor’s admittance, Hutto said the governor is trying to “bigfoot” the state’s elections board.
“The governor shouldn’t come in and try and somehow force the Election Commission to do something that state law prohibits,” the Orangeburg Democrat told the judge.
All five members of the agency’s governing board are appointed by the governor to four-year terms. However, state law doesn’t allow the governor to remove them mid-term without cause. Hutto argued that’s meant to ensure the commission’s independence.
Grayson Lambert, the governor’s lawyer, said McMaster is not trying to inject himself into the commission’s ongoing negotiations with the federal government.
“This is not about politicizing anything. This is not about bigfooting the Election Commission,” Lambert said. “This is about defending state law and helping ensure that state law is properly interpreted.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3406-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

Gov. Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown separately submitted formal comments this month opposing the rollback of the so-called Roadless Rule.

On the other side of the debate, logging interests have weighed in, urging the federal government to move ahead.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which houses the U.S. Forest Service, is aiming to finalize its rewrite of the rule before the end of next year.
The Trump administration’s proposed overhaul of the rule would end protections for about 45 million acres nationwide.
“In Washington state, these protections sustain clean water, fish and wildlife habitat, tribal treaty and cultural resources, and an outdoor recreation economy vital to our state’s identity,” Ferguson said in a letter submitted to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on Sept. 18. 
Public comment on the federal proposal closed Sept. 19. The Department of Agriculture indicated there will be another opportunity for public comment when a draft environmental impact statement is released in March 2026. 
Washington has a total of 9.2 million acres of national forest land, of which 2 million are protected by the Roadless Rule. 
Roadless areas within the state include parts of the Olympic, Mount Baker Snoqualmie, Gifford Pinchot, Wenatchee, Okanogan, Colville, and Umatilla National Forests. Roadless areas also connect wildlife habitats in Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park and Mount Rainier National Park, and border waterways such as the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
The 49-page document Brown signed onto was submitted by the attorneys general of Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont.
Brown noted that recreational areas protected by the Roadless Rule in Washington contribute to an estimated $400 million in economic activity tied directly to U.S. Forest Service lands. 
The rule also protects critical habitat for roughly a dozen threatened and endangered species, including Chinook salmon, gray wolves and the northern spotted owl, Brown said. 
Rescinding the rule, he said, would harm Washington’s economy and jeopardize the work the state has put into supporting the recovery of threatened and endangered species. 
Opening new areas up for road construction would also be unwise, Brown said, due to a backlog of national forest road maintenance in Washington. His comments cite estimates of over $236 million in maintenance already needed across 8,500 miles of forest service roads. As the roads erode, they deposit sediment into water systems and harm water quality. 
Rescinding the rule is in line with the Trump administration’s commitment to remove “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk, but also stifle economic growth in rural America,” Rollins said in a statement last month.  
As opposition boils up, industry groups, like the American Forest Resource Council, are backing the administration, saying that leaving the forests off limits has allowed them to grow too dense, raising the risks of wildfires and tree disease. 
“The Roadless Rule is based on the false notion that doing nothing is the best way to protect our forests,” American Forest Resource Council President Travis Joseph said in a statement this month. The council advocates for the timber industry in the Northwest. It submitted public comments in support of the proposed rule change with the California Forestry Association. 
In their joint comments, the American Forest Resource Council and the California Forestry Association said the Roadless Rule “unnecessarily prohibits, restricts, or reduces responsible access and active forest management.” They argue that active forest management, which includes logging, is “the most effective way to mitigate fire risk.” 
Opponents, including Brown and his fellow attorneys general, counter that the Roadless Rule allows for wildfire mitigation in the protected areas and argue that more human activity in the forests will increase fire risks. 
The comments from the attorneys general detail a range of procedures the U.S. Department of Agriculture has to follow before it can rescind the rule, including considering a reasonable range of alternatives and ensuring adequate public comment.
If the department does move forward with rescinding the rule, it is also required to work with the affected states and tribes to ensure compliance with other laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.
The American Forest Resource Council maintains that rescinding the rule will not undermine these other environmental safeguards. 
“It simply restores flexibility for local forest professionals to consider limited road access where necessary for science-based restoration or emergency response,” Joseph said.
Ferguson called for the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide a clear framework on how environmental protections will be maintained if the Roadless Rule is axed. 
“Absent such assurances, rescission risks undermining stability, predictability, and trust that communities, tribes, and states rely on,” Ferguson said. 
The lack of that framework, combined with the “abbreviated comment period and lack of tribal consultation” on the proposal, Ferguson said, has caused “significant uncertainty and concern.”
The statements from Ferguson and Brown come after tribal leaders and environmental advocates held a rally at the state Capitol earlier this month opposing the rule’s repeal.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/timber.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

Michelle Lujan Grisham joins Delaware and Kansas governors to urge congressional Republicans to extend ACA health insurance tax credits.,"Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (left), NM Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (below) held a press call on Sept. 24, 2025, urging Congressional Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits. (Screen grab)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday joined fellow Democratic governors from Kansas and Delaware to urge Congressional Republicans to extend the federal Affordable Care Act premium tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.
The health insurance credits have become a sticking point in negotiations over a spending bill Congress needs to pass to avoid a government shut-down at the end of the month.
According to nonprofit health care research organization KFF, over nine in 10 enrollees receive some amount of premium tax credit for their health insurance, which, if they expire, will cause out-of-pocket premiums to rise by more than 75% on average for the vast majority of individuals and families buying coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The tax credits also have also contributed “substantially” to Marketplace enrollment more than doubling to 24.3 million people in 2025, KFF says.
Currently, 75,000 New Mexicans are enrolled in the state’s marketplace, BeWell, for either health and/or dental insurance, according to an August news release from the state’s Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, and 88% of enrollees qualify for federal and state premium assistance. At present, more than 50% of those customers pay less than $10 a month for coverage, as a result of federal and state subsidies, OSI says. The office approved 2026 rates that will have an average increase of 35.7%. New Mexico’s own Health Care Affordability Fund will help offset the loss of the federal premium tax credits, OSI says, and the state Legislature plans to address the issue as part of its agenda for the special session starting Oct. 1.
In her remarks in Wednesday’s press call, Lujan Grisham said that “more than 27,000 folks, given the cost, the increased cost of these premiums, will be forced out of the private marketplace. They will make too much to be eligible for Medicaid, and even if they were, with the cuts to Medicaid down the pike, they are in an unstable, unsure situation.” 
The budget bill enacted by President Donald Trump in July includes cuts and changes to both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that the New Mexico Legislature also plan to address in next week’s special legislative session.
Lujan Grisham acknowledged that the state’s affordability fund will help counter some of the negative impact in New Mexico if the federal credits expire, but noted that with rising costs, more of the fund will be needed to cover more people and will provide less coverage. “And that’s the problem,” she said. But moreover, she added, “I’m also pitching for America. Kansas doesn’t have one of those funds. California doesn’t have one of those funds. Texas doesn’t have one of those funds…and so we need to make sure that we’re doing something for America.”
Lastly, she added, “most of our providers and coverage entities, our HMOs and insurance companies, are multi-state or national. Some of them are international. This has a chilling impact on the stability of our overall healthcare systems for everyone. I want Congress to do the right thing here and make sure Americans are adequately protected.”
Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said that extending the tax credits “is one of the simplest ways for Congress to bring relief to working American families that, let’s be honest, are already stretched thin and one of the most effective ways to foster long term economic growth. These aren’t statistics. These are families. These are small business owners. These are neighbors.”
Bottom line, Kansas Gov. and DGA Chair Laura Kelly said: “We’re here today calling on Republicans in Congress to do the right thing, come to the table, correct the fatal error of the budget bill that’s ripping through families and communities across our country, and extend ACA tax credits to help families afford basic health care. As Democratic governors, we represent the majority of American people in blue, purple and red states, we know that access to health care shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DGAnewsSept242025-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — More than 40 people showed up at a federal courthouse Wednesday for a hearing on the future of a University of South Dakota art professor suspended for a social media post about the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. 
Speaking with that crowd surrounding him and U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier in front of him, Phillip Michael Hook’s lawyer said Hook ought to be immediately reinstated, and that the Board of Regents should not be allowed to proceed with a Monday disciplinary hearing that could end with his termination. 
Some in the audience walked into the courthouse with Hook, with whom they’d been speaking outside the courthouse in downtown Sioux Falls shortly before the hearing. Rick Weiland, a Sioux Falls activist known for his campaigns for Medicaid expansion and other progressive ballot measures, was among those in attendance.
A public sector employee “doesn’t forfeit the right to free speech because they happen to be a public employee,” Rapid City lawyer Jim Leach said.
Kirk was killed Sept. 10. That same day, Hook wrote a Facebook post that used a derogatory term to describe Kirk and questioned the veracity of his supporters’ “concerns” about political violence. The Facebook page was his personal account, but noted his status as a USD professor. He deleted the post within three hours, Leach said.

South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen soon called for Hook’s dismissal, as did the Legislature’s Freedom Caucus. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he was “shaking mad” about Hook’s post. 
Hook was suspended on Sept. 12 and served a notice of his pending termination.
He was suspended because he angered powerful people in South Dakota with commentary on a “matter of public concern,” Leach said. 
“Yet here, we have the government, at the highest level, punishing Professor Hook for his political speech,” he added, arguing that Speaker Hansen’s communications with USD President Sheila Gestring appeared to be all it took to set the wheels of termination in motion.
Court precedent says a public employee can be fired for speech, Leach said, but there must be evidence that the speech was disruptive to the employer. In Hook’s case, Leach said, there’s no evidence in the record — including in the termination notice — that it was. 
Instead, he argued, the termination notice was an unconstitutional violation of Hook’s First Amendment rights and grounds for an immediate court order that would reinstate him and block the University of South Dakota from proceeding with its disciplinary action and barring retaliatory action. 
Justin Bell, representing the Board of Regents, admitted there’s no evidence in the disciplinary or court record that Hook’s post was disruptive to the workplace. But Bell told Schreier that’s because the court record is barely more than 24 hours old. Hook filed his case on Tuesday. 
Instead of immediately shutting down the Board of Regents, Bell argued, the judge should allow the case to proceed. 
The post, Bell argued, generated “hundreds” of calls and emails to the school, and may have created disruption for students and faculty.
With comments “as insidious as Professor Hook’s, made in a capacity that mentions his status at the university, it’s reasonable to conclude that there’s going to be disruption” for his employer, Bell said.
To say Hook was fired because Speaker Hansen reached out to the school’s president, Bell said, downplays the impact the post had for the university in potentially alienating a yet-untallied number of students, alumni and faculty.
“All we know is that Speaker Hansen is one of the people who reached out,” Bell said.
The First Amendment, Bell argued, “does not protect speech of this nature.” 
Judge Schreier said she would take the request for a temporary restraining order under advisement and issue a ruling in the coming days.

The Arkansas Department of Education issued a press release Friday announcing that a sliding-scale reimbursement structure would take effect Oct. 1 for its School Readiness Assistance Program to “prioritize access for working families and manage program demand responsibly.” The changes aim to reduce the program’s waitlist and sustain services statewide, the department said. 
Funded through the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, the program provides financial assistance for child care to eligible, low-income families while parents work or attend school. The program currently serves more than 16,000 children in Arkansas. In February, the state created a waitlist (which now has around 1,100 children on it) so seats could be offered as funding became available, according to ADE.
Arkansas Department of Education creates searchable child care provider database

In a statement Wednesday, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families said the changes to the program will make child care for eligible families less affordable, create barriers for providers to offer high-quality care and make it difficult for providers to keep programs running. The nonprofit called on the education department to delay the changes and solicit input from child care providers, families and community members who depend on quality child care programs. 
“It is disheartening that these changes were made without transparency and blindsided families and the early childhood care and education community,” the AACF statement reads. “The changes were announced on September 19, 2025, and go into effect on October 1. There is no time for providers and families to plan, and children are the ones left to feel the impact.”  
The decision to update rates and copayments on Oct. 1 was “driven by the need to ensure the program remains financially sustainable while continuing to prioritize access for working families across Arkansas,” ADE spokesperson Rachel Starks said Wednesday. Additionally, the state is serving more families “than ever before, and the program was heavily subsidized by COVID relief funds that have now expired,” she said.
“We recognize that implementing these changes on a short timeline can create challenges for providers as they plan budgets and communicate with families,” Starks said. “Please know that our team is reviewing all questions and comments as we work to provide additional guidance, resources, and technical support for providers during this transition.”
The updated copayment structure announced by the education department aligns provider reimbursement rates with Arkansas’ market rate survey so payments reflect current care costs, and adjusts the sliding-scale copay based on family income, according to the department news release. The state is also revising eligibility requirements to reflect the 2026 estimated family State Median Income, “which will allow more working families at the lowest income levels to receive priority,” according to the release. 
Under the changes, providers will be reimbursed at a single statewide market rate, except in Northwest Arkansas where Benton and Washington counties will have a higher market rate, according to ADE. 


Let us know what you think...


 

“Arkansas families rely on child care to work or complete their education, and providers need predictable funding to serve them well,” Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in the release. “By aligning payments to current market costs, using a sliding-scale copay, and updated income requirements, we can prioritize the youngest children, and focus support where it is needed most.”
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to ADE. A family of three with a child under four and an income below $30,334 qualifies for up to $35 per day in childcare assistance with no copay. Families whose income is just under $64,459, may have a required copay of up to $12 per day depending on their child’s age.
Arkansas education department reduces work requirement for child care assistance program

AACF argued in its statement that more families already struggling to make ends meet will be required to pay a copayment to continue participating in the program as a result of the announced changes. 
“Last year, Arkansas made strides by eliminating copayments for families whose household income was between 40-75% of the state median income (SMI),” AACF stated. “Now, the state is reverting to old ways and requiring payment from those families with incomes over 40% of SMI who just recently got relief.”
Federal rules prohibit copayments higher than 7% of a family’s income, but the new structure lists a dollar rate that could exceed that amount, according to the nonprofit. 
The state’s reimbursement rate structure for providers is also reversing course, according to AACF, who noted that historically, Arkansas incentivized quality by offering higher reimbursement rates based on what quality level a provider earned. 
“Now, reimbursement rates will be a flat rate system, with the rate set depending on the type of care provided, like infant or school-aged,” AACF said. “Participating child care providers in most of the state will experience an average decrease in reimbursement of 18.5%. Some providers will lose $39 per day for each eligible infant enrolled in their programs.”
Noting the LEARNS Act, a wide-ranging education law approved by lawmakers in 2023 that overhauled the state’s K-12 system, “required engagement with stakeholders to create a seamless early childhood educational system that addresses access to quality child care,” AACF argued these new “unilateral changes move the state in the opposite direction.” 
“These changes will likely result in child care staff losing jobs, lower quality child care programs, increased prices for private payers, providers struggling even more to make ends meet, families who cannot afford the copayment losing access to child care, and ultimately, a harsher system for the families who need support the most,” AACF stated.

Vermont State Police identified Brady McGee as the officer who shot a resident at the end of a daylong standoff at a Riverside Avenue apartment complex on Sunday.
Police also identified Aaron Loucks, 32, of Burlington, as the man who was injured in the incident. 
Burlington police officers responded to a disturbance at the complex that morning, but Loucks “barricaded himself inside his residence,” according to a Tuesday press release from the state police. A confrontation with police began when he exited the apartment. 
Officers tried non-deadly force measures that were unsuccessful before McGee “discharged his patrol rifle, shooting Loucks,” the press release stated. 
Following the police shooting, Loucks remains in custody while receiving medical treatment at the University of Vermont Medical Center. He’s facing two misdemeanor charges of aggravated disorderly conduct, one for abusive obscene language and the other for threat of bodily injury or violence. 
Meanwhile, McGee remains on paid administrative leave pending a Vermont State Police investigation into his use of force, according to the press release. 
It isn’t the first time Loucks has faced criminal charges that raised concerns about his mental health. And it isn’t the first time McGee has been placed on leave by the police department.

In 2021, Loucks faced federal charges for possession of a firearm while using drugs after he allegedly threatened to disrupt Covid-19 vaccine distribution. 
“Loucks has struggled with psychological and drug addiction issues since high school,” according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Vermont about the 2021 charges. 
Court documents show that residents called police after Loucks was yelling death threats and racial slurs out of his apartment window. 
One person reported that Loucks yelled something similar to “I am the bringer of death,” while gesturing with his hands that he was pointing an imaginary gun at them. Another person reported that Loucks was screaming the “N-word” at Black children playing outside the building and called one Black neighbor a “slave.” 
When police responded to the scene, Loucks flashed a knife blade at officers from a second story window and said “I want all of you to die,” court records show. 
One neighbor at the scene on Sunday afternoon told VTDigger she heard the suspect screaming and threatening police, and that the standoff had escalated throughout the day. 
Following the shooting, the Burlington Police Officer’s Association issued a statement in support of McGee’s use of force. 
“We at the BPOA are very proud of how our officers handled this extremely volatile, dynamic and dangerous situation,” the union wrote in its statement. 
McGee joined Burlington’s police department in 2018, then left to join another department in Connecticut in 2022 before returning to Burlington’s department later that year. 
During his second stint with the department, McGee was placed on paid administrative leave in December 2023 after allegedly driving his motorcycle up to 100 miles per hour alongside other police officers while off duty, according to Seven Days. 
For that incident, McGee was charged with negligent operation after the incident and pleaded not guilty, Seven Days reported.

Revenue Secretary Michael Houdyshell said computer access for staff is now limited to what they need for their jobs, and the department’s upgraded computer system logs “every single click” on an employee’s computer. He said the department now has automated alerts for unusual transactions, routes outside users through a secure e-portal, and blocks employees from accessing their own or family members’ records.
Those upgrades followed revelations of former departmental employees creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes or secure loans.
Houdyshell said the agency has also set up an anonymous tip line, requires annual conflict-of-interest and ethics training, and hired extra staff to ensure the department’s system is secure.
Althoff spoke about a former Child Protection Services employee who stole $1.8 million from the state over the course of 13 years. She was sent to prison earlier this year after being convicted of submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023. 
“This is a situation where a voucher was being requested or initiated by the same employee that was approving it,” Althoff said. ”Well, that’s a problem. That’s a big problem.”
Althoff said the department has since overhauled its financial protocols. The department now segregates duties and requires multi-step approvals for new providers and payments, automatically closes accounts when a child ages out of the system, and is shifting from paper checks to electronic transfers. The agency also hired extra employees to evaluate risks and additional management for Child Protection Services. 
Committee Chair Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, praised the new safeguards.
“Fraud will always be an issue, but it sounds like you guys are doing a great job of getting a handle on it,” Howard said.
In other recent cases, former state employees faced accusations including self-issuing a medical marijuana card, forging food service inspection reports and spending vouchers intended for foster families on personal expenses.

In response to the run of prosecutions, Attorney General Marty Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal delivers whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)States don’t have to help enforce the Trump administration’s immigration policies to get disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a federal judge in Providence ruled Wednesday.
Senior U.S. District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted a motion for a permanent injunction against the Department of Homeland Security, calling a federal directive issued in April “coercive, ambiguous, unrelated to the purpose of the federal grants, and undermine[s] the system of federalism.” 
The directive made enforcing the administration’s immigration detention policy agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief aid.
“States rely on these grants for billions of dollars annually in disaster relief,” wrote Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. “Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed.”
A group of 20 Democratic states attorneys general filed suit against the Department of Homeland Security in May, claiming the agency lacked the legal authority to require states to abide by immigration policy in order to receive funding.
They argued in their initial lawsuit that not only was the policy unconstitutional, but violated the Administrative Procedure Act.
Like all Democratic lawsuits, the AGs called the decision “arbitrary and capricious.” The Department of Homeland Security disagreed, arguing that conditions align with its core mission of enforcing federal immigration law.
But that was not enough of a justification for Smith.
“Such platitudes cannot substitute for an actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” he wrote. 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha called Smith’s ruling a “win for the rule of law” and reaffirmed that President Donald Trump cannot pick and choose what federal laws to follow.
“Today’s permanent injunction by Judge Smith says, in no uncertain terms, that this Administration may not illegally impose immigration conditions on congressionally allocated federal funding for emergency services like disaster relief and flood mitigation,” Neronha said in a statement. “Case closed.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature will form a new interim committee and is anticipating a special session to handle $500 million expected from the federal government for rural health care over the next five years.
The Rural Health Transformation Program, created by the 10-year budget reconciliation law, makes $50 billion available to states to improve health care in rural communities between 2026 and 2030. 
It was held out by members of Congress as a means to offset losses rural states will suffer from federal cuts to Medicaid approved elsewhere in the bill.
North Dakota will receive at least $100 million each year from the program, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. 
Officials predict only 5% of North Dakota Medicaid recipients will be impacted by program changes

The application was released Sept. 15. States only have until Nov. 5 to apply, which must include plans for how they will use their money.
North Dakota could be eligible for more funding based on the quality of its application, Aker said.
“We really want to make sure that we’re setting up North Dakota to be competitive,” Aker told lawmakers during a Wednesday committee meeting.
The money can be used for behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development, disease prevention and chronic disease, and other areas described in the bill.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, announced after Aker’s presentation that Legislative Management would assemble a committee of lawmakers to help the Department of Health and Human Services put together its application.

The committee will likely include members of the standing Human Services Committee, the chairs of the Senate and House appropriations committees and lawmakers who serve on the Human Services Division of the Budget Section, Hogue said.
He acknowledged the state will be under a time crunch to prepare its application, so the committee members should expect a “very aggressive” October meeting schedule.
“They want to get the money out to the states, and they want to see the states spend it in short order,” Hogue said.
Hogue said in an interview he expects a special legislative session, but the timing at this point is unknown.
“There will have to be a special session because the federal legislation says the money has to be obligated,” Hogue said. “We don’t come back until January 2027.” 
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said the shortened application window provides challenges.
“We want to do it correctly so that it benefits the state to the best of our ability,” Lefor said.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

The Department of Health and Human Services also would seek spending authority from the Legislature in future regular legislative sessions.
The Department of Health and Human Services put out a survey to health care providers and members of the public in August to gather ideas on how the state should use the money, Aker said.
Survey respondents identified the retention and recruitment of rural health care workers as a leading priority, according to a presentation to lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.
Aker said the agency will host listening sessions in October to walk through the results of the survey and give the public more opportunities to provide input.
She said previously that the Department of Health and Human Services expects 3% to 5% of the state’s Medicaid population to be impacted by new eligibility requirements authorized in the tax break and spending law.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A state-spanning sting operation in June drew indictments for the owners of five smoke shops in South Dakota this week, according to Attorney General Marty Jackley.
The indictments, issued between Sept. 16 and Tuesday, were the result of targeted purchases of products marketed as legal in stores in Aberdeen, Sioux Falls, Pierre and Rapid City. 
Authorities suspected the products — some made using hemp-derived but chemically modified ingredients, others made with chemicals marketed as “magic mushrooms” — contained illegal compounds or were sold for the express purpose of intoxication.
“Every one of the five shops where we did buys had illegal drugs,” Jackley said. 
Only one shop owner was indicted on felony charges. In that case, originating with a purchase at Masterpiece Smoke Shop in Pierre, the owner is alleged to have sold felony amounts of marijuana that had been marketed as legal hemp. That charge was tied to pre-rolled “Thumpers” joints, according to court documents. 
Rapid City policing agencies target ‘diet weed’ with compliance checks

That owner is also alleged to have sold a product called “Legal Magic Mushrooms” that allegedly contain a controlled substance called psilocin. The owner also faces a felony charge of distributing drugs in a drug-free zone.
The other shops targeted were All the Smoke in Aberdeen, Puff City in Sioux Falls, Blazin’ Aces Smokes and Vape in Sioux Falls, and ZyGlam Smoke Shop in Rapid City. The charges in those cases are misdemeanors.
Jackley announced the indictments at the Law Enforcement Center in Sioux Falls, flanked by officials from multiple agencies on one side and posters showing a package of “magic mushroom” chocolates on the other. 
Many of the products sold by smoke shops across South Dakota are marketed as being derived from hemp and therefore legal under the 2018 federal farm bill, but Jackley said the packaging makes clear that “these are not agricultural products.”
“They’re clearly packaged for kids,” he said. 
Lawmakers in South Dakota passed a bill in 2024 to bar the sale — but not the possession — of products whose hemp-based intoxicants are chemically modified. That crime is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Local police in Rapid City conducted a compliance check targeting businesses suspected of selling modified hemp earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office was still waiting on lab test results for the products purchased from eight shops in that operation. 
In early August, Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Aaron Benson told South Dakota Searchlight that his department had sent warning letters to smoke shops, conducted compliance checks, and intends to continue doing so.
Of the four shop owners indicted for misdemeanors in the statewide sting, three face the modified hemp charge. Another shop owner was charged with the sale of industrial hemp for smoking. All four misdemeanor indictments include charges for selling a product for the purposes of intoxication, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.

The project, which cost about $55 million, is one of the largest affordable housing developments built in Vermont in recent memory.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
SHELBURNE — Once the site of an Econo Lodge motel, a nondescript lot tucked off Route 7 has been transformed into this Chittenden County town’s newest neighborhood.
Called Bay Ridge, it is one of the largest affordable housing developments built in Vermont in recent memory. Nearly 100 new homes will be either rented or sold at permanently subsidized rates.
At a ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday, elected officials hailed the project — a joint effort by the nonprofits Champlain Housing Trust and Evernorth — as a model for addressing the state’s housing crisis. 
“We want to make more dollars available so that this kind of project can be replicated across the state,” said Vermont Senate Majority Leader Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, who lives a half-mile away from the development. 
All of the homes in the new neighborhood come with income-restrictions for potential tenants and buyers to qualify.
The development consists of 68 apartments, including one-bedrooms in renovated motel buildings and three- and four-bedroom units in sleek, newly-constructed buildings. Rents range widely; a three-bedroom costs $1,725 monthly, according to the housing trust. Twenty of the apartments will be set aside for people who have been unhoused.

Twenty-six shared-equity condominiums, priced between $170,000 to $190,000 each, line a freshly paved road. Their estimated market values are more than twice that amount, according to the trust’s website. 
The development will feature both on-site and off-site solar arrays to offset energy usage, and it will soon host a playground. Families have already begun to move in.
The project, which cost about $55 million, was among the largest recipients of federal Covid-era funding that Vermont poured into housing development. It also received $14 million in private equity from federal tax credits.
On average, it cost about $584,000 to build each of the new homes, according to a funding source breakdown provided by Champlain Housing Trust. That’s more than double the median cost of affordable rental housing in Vermont before the pandemic, when construction costs skyrocketed.
Champlain Housing Trust purchased the old Econo Lodge more than a decade ago as temporary housing for people experiencing homelessness. As the organization began to redevelop the site, it purchased another hotel across the street, which it continues to run as an emergency shelter.
While the pace of homebuilding in Vermont has picked up over the last few years, publicly-subsidized affordable housing – including projects like Bay Ridge – make up a modest fraction of the overall market. Recent assessments indicate that the state still needs to double or triple the number of homes produced annually to return the market to a healthy condition.  
“Often when we’re here at these ribbon cuttings, people will say, you know, ‘This is great that we have this housing, but it’s a drop in the bucket in Vermont,’” said U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., at the event on Wednesday. “But we have to celebrate the successes. We have to draw attention to the fact that we are making progress.”

(Screenshot via Florida Channel livestream)A Florida Board of Education member said Wednesday that he views local school board members who have defied state directives as “clout chasing.”
During a meeting in Fort Walton Beach, board members again spent a chunk of time voicing displeasure with the Alachua County School Board’s behavior.
On the big screen at the meeting held at Northwest Florida State College, DOE officials displayed a Facebook comment from the Alachua board’s vice chair Tina Certain following the death of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and his memorial service Sunday in Arizona. 
“I didn’t watch any of that Drump rally! I went to see an elder bcs the weight of it all — how a 31 yr old uneducated white boy has been glorified,” Certain wrote in a Facebook comment. “He has a organization bcs a millionaire gave him money & connections to start it. To see the feds & state elevate him angers me. It is heavy but I know I can stay home. Gotta fight despite being tired of it all.”
State board member Daniel Foganholi made known his view. 
“If it’s a mistake, and a true mistake, we show grace. It’s not a mistake,” Foganholi said. 
“I am convinced that this is what we call clout chasing. A lot of these board members are no-names, have no name recognition, and if they do something to get the attention of the commissioner, or the governor, or the community, to get 500-plus complaints on saying something, then they get corrected, then all of the sudden, they’re on CNN being victim.”
During its last meeting in August, the board voted to keep an eye on the Alachua board for the coming school year to ensure that its members do not suppress the First Amendment rights of the public, something state officials claim happened. 
Alachua County School Board falls under close scrutiny from Board of Education

Last month, the Alachua board’s chair, Sarah Rockwell, was criticized by state board members following her posting to Facebook about the death of professional wrestler Hulk Hogan.
Now, state board members expressed to Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas that they are ready to take action against the county board. State board member Marylynn Magar said the Alachua board is “baiting” and “trying to get a reaction out of us.”
“If you want a reaction out of this board, I can tell you, you’ll probably get it,” Magar said.
State board member Esther Byrd said she is “out of words.” “This isn’t workable, it just can’t continue like this.”
“They know what they’re doing. These board members know what they’re doing,” Foganholi said. “All of the sudden, I’m a victim on the evening news, and then all of the sudden you’ll see next year somebody’s running for higher office, I got it.”
Foganholi referenced two incidents in the state. In Leon County, a member of its board criticized Kamoutsas for sending out a letter warning against commenting negatively about Kirk’s death and went on to call Kirk “a racist, misogynist, homophobic Klansman.” In Palm Beach County, board member Edwin Ferguson, during a meeting, called Kirk a “racist bigot.”
“I’m not convinced it’s a mistake, now it’s about clout chasing,” Foganholi said during the Alachua discussion. 
Earlier this month, Hillsborough County School Board member Jessica Vaughn suggested she could run for governor if she is removed from that board for battling with the state over removing books from libraries considered sexually explicit.
“Got board members running for senator, governor — we see it. So I don’t think it’s an accident,” Foganholi said. 
Foganholi previously served as a two-time Gov. Ron DeSantis-appointee to the Broward County School Board. He ran for election to stay on the board, but lost. Days after his unsuccessful bid for the Broward board, DeSantis again appointed him, this time to the State Board of Education.

U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack, a Republican from Gainesville, criticized Certain’s social media comment.
“Instead of prioritizing our children, the @AlachuaSchool board members seem to be teaching a master class in hate,” Cammack posted to X on Tuesday.
“@TinaCert, you have failed our children, you are promoting hate, and for that, you should resign immediately,” the representative concluded. 
WCJB reported that Certain rejected Cammack’s call to resign. In a statement provided to the TV station, Certain said Kirk’s “rhetoric was intended to demean through racism,” citing his previous comments about Supreme Court Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (R-Texas), and political commentator Joy Reid.
Certain told the news station that “Charlie Kirk’s assassination was tragic and horrific, and my prayers are with his wife, his children, and all who loved him,” and “While my personal Facebook comment was poorly worded it does not change the reality of his rhetoric.”
Reactions to Kirk’s death have prompted a national discussion about freedom of speech and speech calling for violence.
“For me, it’s seeing that, and somebody that is a minority, somebody that has experienced racism, you replace that word right there, ‘white boy’ with ‘brown boy or black boy,’ it’s outrage. I don’t care if it’s reverse racism, racism is racism,” Foganholi said. 
“I think we’ve had enough,” Board Chair Ryan Petty said of Certain’s Facebook comment, asking Kamoutsas to research how the state board can take action against the Alachua County school board member. 
The state also sent a letter to Alachua County on Tuesday, informing them they are out of compliance in not reporting School Environmental Safety Incident Reporting data, the department said. Alachua County is the only district in the state that has not submitted the data, Kamoutsas said.
“It”s one thing though to run a sloppy and dysfunctional board meeting, it’s quite another to violate state law,” Petty said. “And that SESIR data as the board in Alachua should be aware, is critical to understanding whether or not there are school safety issues in the county.”
The district had three days from the sending of the letter to respond to the state. If not, Petty said he will call a special board meeting.

Jeffrey Amestoy, chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1997 to 2004, is best known for authoring the 1999 decision in Baker vs. Vermont that legalized same-sex civil unions. That case laid the groundwork for the legalization of same sex marriage in Vermont a decade later and ultimately led to the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same sex marriage in 2015.
At the age of 79, Amestoy is still a prolific writer, but in a different genre. His latest book is a true crime legal thriller that he spent years researching. Winters’ Time: A Secret Pledge, a Severed Head, and the Murder That Brought America’s Most Famous Lawyer to Vermont, is the story of when celebrity attorney Clarence Darrow came to Vermont to defend a convicted murderer before the Vermont Supreme Court. The book was just published by the Vermont Historical Society.
Winters’ Time recounts the brutal murder of Cecelia Gullivan, who was killed in her home in Windsor, Vermont in November 1926. Gullivan, a single woman, was the treasurer of the Cone Automatic Machine company in Windsor. Police quickly arrested John Winters, a machinist at her company, and he was promptly tried, convicted and sentenced to death. That’s when Clarence Darrow entered the case after the Winters family called in a favor promised by Darrow’s son.
Amestoy, who was Vermont’s attorney general from 1985 to 1997, set the scene for what would become one of Vermont’s most sensational trials. “By the 1920s you had the first real mass media with radio and newspapers racing to outdo each other in circulation wars that focused primarily on murders and then a tremendous interest in celebrities,” Amestoy said. “Darrow sort of combined two of those: he was an extraordinarily successful defense lawyer, adamantly opposed to capital punishment … And then he was famous for his ability to speak to larger social issues.”
The death penalty was among the issues at play. “There was a tremendous amount of focus on capital punishment in Vermont but not, in fact, from those opposed to it, more about making sure that Vermont had a method of execution that would work,” said Amestoy. Winters would be only the second person executed by electric chair, which had recently been installed at the Windsor prison.
Vermont executed 26 people between 1778 and 1954. The state abolished capital punishment in 1972 following a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most sensational aspect of the trial of John Winters was the prosecution’s use of the victim’s severed head as an exhibit. “That had never happened in Vermont legal history and as far as I was able to determine, hadn’t ever happened in American legal history either,” said Amestoy.
Amestoy said that the Winters case “gave us a lens on Vermont in the 1920s in terms of gender.” Cecilia Gullivan was an “extraordinary single woman, sort of a modern woman of the time.” He noted that Gullivan was “probably the highest ranking female executive in Vermont, a tremendously capable woman who had the authority for managing the plant.” Her murder was “extraordinary because of the status of the victim, and it immediately became front page news, not only in Vermont, but in Boston and really all over the country.”
There were rumors raised at Winters’ trial that Gullivan was in a relationship with Frank Cone, the owner of the company, who some thought was a suspect in her death. Amestoy noted that women did not sit on juries at that time. Vermont in the 1920s was “not attuned to issues of gender,” said Amestoy.
Clarence Darrow succeeded in winning a retrial for John Winters, who then pleaded guilty to second degree murder on Darrow’s advice, though Winters publicly maintained his innocence. After serving 20 years in prison, Winters was pardoned in 1949 by Gov. Ernest Gibson. Clarence Darrow had saved the convict’s life.
Amestoy is no stranger to sensational cases himself. His civil unions decision, which he famously wrote “is simply a recognition of our common humanity,” changed the national conversation about same sex unions.
“I thought that opinion helped move that issue in a way that allowed Vermonters to address a social issue of extraordinary importance in a way that I think stood as an example to the country. So to have been able to play a part in that was obviously something I was thankful for.”

But the city's officials say their legal fight with CoreCivic is strictly about making the company follow development codes. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Leavenworth officials aren’t backing down from holding private prison company CoreCivic accountable to development regulations even after the U.S. Department of Justice jumped into the case Tuesday.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the U.S. District Court case between Nashville-based CoreCivic and Leavenworth, arguing the city was violating the supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution.
“The federal government’s filing does not change our view of the case or the approach we plan to take,” said W. Joseph Hatley, a Kansas City, Missouri, attorney representing the city of Leavenworth. “The arguments in that filing mirror arguments CoreCivic has previously made, without success.”
The clause says federal laws are supreme over state laws, and in its filing, the DOJ said Leavenworth is interfering in the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.
Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman has said the city’s fight over reopening CoreCivic’s prison isn’t driven by politics, despite repeated outcry from Leavenworth residents against housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. 
She said the city is concerned about holding businesses accountable to their development regulations, which would require CoreCivic to apply for a special use permit.
Earlier this year, CoreCivic announced it planned to reopen its prison facility in Leavenworth to fulfill an ICE contract that would pay the company $4.2 million per month. But Leavenworth officials contend the company must follow the city’s revised development process and apply for a special use permit.
In court filings, the city’s attorneys highlighted issues with CoreCivic’s operation of its previous prison, which closed in 2021, including failing to cooperate with Leavenworth police and failure to report the death of an inmate for six days. Leavenworth officials have said a special use permit would allow them to address such problems.  
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Wednesday set a hearing on a CoreCivic motion for a preliminary injunction for 3 p.m. Nov. 25, Hatley said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER  — An advocate for legislation that would have banned drivers from operating a motor vehicle while using a cellphone lashed out at a state legislator on Wednesday, claiming that she prevented the measure from advancing in the Florida House of Representatives and potentially becoming state law earlier this year.
Tallahassee resident Demetrius Branca’s 19-year-old son Anthony died in 2014 when a distracted driver hit him as he rode his motorcycle to Tallahassee State College. In the past few years, he’s personally lobbied local governments and state lawmakers up and down Florida to pass legislation enhancing the state’s ban on texting while driving to get a “hands-free” distracted driving measure into law.
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
In the 2025 regular legislative session, a hands-free driving bill sponsored by Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, was approved in that chamber, 37-9. But its House companion (HB 501) sponsored by Rep. Allison Tant (D-Tallahassee) never moved at all.
The bill was placed in two House committees: the Government Operations Subcommittee, chaired by Pinellas County Republican Linda Chaney, and State Affairs, chaired by Manatee County Republican Will Robinson. Neither lawmaker allowed the bill to come before their committees.
Appearing during the Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting on Wednesday, an angry Branca called out Chaney, who sat with her colleagues on a stage at St. Petersburg College’s Clearwater campus.
“You stopped it cold,” he said to her. “After all the work, all the testimony, all the grieving parents who begged you to act. You chose to not let it through. That was not leadership, that was political cowardice and I’m standing here to look you in the eye and tell you to your face.”
Pinellas County Republican Rep. Linda Chaney (Photo via the Florida House of Representatives)
Chaney did not comment at the time. She left the meeting about a half-hour before it concluded and did not respond to a request for comment by a Phoenix reporter later in the day.
A year ago, Branca made equally critical remarks to Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie following a similar legislative standoff. During the 2024 session, Tant’s hands-free driving bill won approval in all three of its committees in that chamber, but a companion bill in the Senate was never heard.
The chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee that year was DiCeglie, and Branca chastised him publicly at the Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting in January for not allowing the bill to advance. The two engaged in a sharp exchange after the event.
But in a Senate committee meeting this April, DiCeglie told Branca that after taking the emotion out of it, he supported the legislation.
“I looked at the statistics,” he said. “I looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son, Anthony.”
“I’m proud that you’re standing here in front of us today telling your story,” DiCeglie added. “That has translated into what I believe is good public policy, and I think that’s going to translate into saving lives. And regardless of what happens this point forward, I think that you can look yourself in the mirror and know that you did what was right in your heart.”
A hands-free driving law went into effect in South Carolina on Sept. 1. That makes 33 states in the U.S. that have passed such legislation.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska Republican U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan signed on to a letter with 10 other U.S. senators, calling on the U.S. Department of Education to reverse the decision to cut millions in congressionally approved grant funding for Native American-serving colleges and universities nationwide. 
The letter, addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, argues that an estimated $36.1 million in grant funding already allocated under the Higher Education Act should be distributed to colleges and universities serving Native students nationwide. 
Senators wrote the funds are already authorized and appropriated by Congress and should go toward its intended colleges and universities nationwide, “including dollars that are part of ongoing grants – projects, programs, and services that are already in motion and that are serving currently enrolled students,” they said. 
“These institutions are statutorily authorized to receive federal support from the Department to strengthen their capacity to serve American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students, and rely on this federal support to adequately serve enrolled students,” they said. 
“The Department’s decision to reprogram this critical source of funding for these colleges jeopardizes not just their continued existence, but also undermines the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to provide Native students an education,” they wrote.
Earlier this month, Sec. McMahon announced that $350 million in congressionally approved funding for minority-serving institutions, a federal grant category that includes funding for Black, Hispanic, Asian-American and Native American students, would be reallocated. McMahon cited “racial quotas” as discriminatory and unconstitutional. “To further our commitment to ending discrimination in all forms across federally supported programs, the Department will no longer award Minority-Serving Institution grants that discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas,” McMahon said. 
The group of three Republican and nine Democratic senators rejected the claims, saying “to be clear, these grants do not impose racial quotas or restrict admissions based on race, but support institutions that deliver on the federal trust responsibility to provide an education for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians because of their unique legal status and political relationship with the United States.”
In Alaska, University of Alaska officials say they are still reviewing the extent of the funding freeze, but University of Alaska Fairbanks officials report the grant elimination totals at least $8.8 million across campuses. 
Senators argued that the funding cut contradicts the Trump administration’s expressed focus on career and technical education, and said the funds boost capacity for institutions serving not only Native students, but wider student populations. 
“As such, we again urge you to reverse the decision,” the senators wrote, “to release these funds, as appropriated by Congress, so that the work these schools do to support the trust responsibility, as well as the next generation of leaders as part of our nation’s bright future, can continue.
The letter was signed by Murkowski, as the chair of the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and committee co-chair U.S. Sen. Brian Shatz, D-Hawaii; along with Sens. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska; Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii; Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina; Ben Ray Luján, D-New Mexico; Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona; John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado; Michael Bennett, D-Colorado; Mark Kelly, D-Arizona; Tina Smith, D-Minnesota; and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota. 
A spokesperson for Murkowski said as of Wednesday they have not had a response from the department.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A state committee approved a series of changes to the State Health Benefits Program on Wednesday that will raise some member costs in a bid to reduce New Jersey’s spending on employee benefits by $150 million in 2026.
The resolutions approved at the State Health Benefit Program’s Wednesday plan design committee meeting will raise copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums, particularly for out-of-network services.
Other changes will increase members’ share of costs for prescription drugs and impose a 50% coinsurance rate on certain procedures — like endoscopies, knee replacements, and colonoscopies, among some others — done by out-of-network providers.
Wednesday’s votes mark the latest attempt to shore up New Jersey’s beleaguered public worker health plans, which have faced years of escalating premiums that threaten a full collapse of some parts of the state plan.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Communications Workers of America, the state’s largest public-sector union, did not return a request for comment.
NJ governor hopefuls split on forcing school districts to merge

Resolutions increasing medical and prescription copays and requiring coinsurance for some out-of-network procedures will apply only to active state workers, not retirees enrolled in the State Health Benefits Program.
The resolutions will increase copays on all classes of prescription drugs, with larger raw increases for higher-cost, brand-name medications. That includes higher copays for GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy.
Members will be required to pay a $45 copay for a 30-day supply of GLP-1 medications if they are engaged in a lifestyle management program, or $125 if they are not.
The plan design changes were spurred by language in the state’s annual budget that requires officials to identify and implement $100 million in savings within the State Health Benefits Program in the current July-to-June fiscal year. Those savings were meant to total $200 million over the course of 2026.
The state’s actuaries rejected nearly every savings proposal submitted by unions, saying they could not weigh the cost savings they promised.
Aon, the actuary, greenlit a range of proposals made by administration officials, many of which focused on reducing the state’s share of health care costs.
That share, called an actuarial value, sits between 93% and 98% in New Jersey’s existing state plans, though most members are enrolled in plans at the higher end of that range, according to a Treasury report released in May.
Administration and labor officials reached a separate agreement earlier in September that reduced the level of cuts and offered more conservative increases to member costs than were originally proposed by the administration.
“This entire environment was greatly disrupted by the budget bill,” said Micahel Zanyor, a committee member who represents the New Jersey State Troopers Fraternal Association. “It created a situation where tough choices had to be made to protect as many people as we could from rate increases, and I believe these five resolutions we’re voting on accomplish that.”
Staff from the state’s pension and benefits division said the changes approved at Wednesday’s meeting would not be in place when the new plan year begins on Jan. 1 and would not affect the plan’s regular open enrollment period, which runs the entire month of October.
Earlier in September, the State Health Benefits Commission approved a 20% premium increase for state workers’ plan and a 37% increase for local government plans administered by the state.
Local government workers’ plan faces a death spiral as municipal governments flee the State Health Benefits Program for options in the private market, according to a March report from the Treasury. Those departures push premiums higher, spurring more towns and counties to drop state plans.

They were wrong and still are. But the model many were hoping would save the day — nonprofit news that depends on donations and grants instead of subscriptions and ads — is more fragile than expected. That proved true this week when Seattle-based Cascade PBS said it is shuttering its vibrant, award-winning newsroom. It marks the end of an 18-year run for the publication originally known as Crosscut, one of the early entrants into nonprofit news.
The organization’s leadership blames $3.5 million in cuts from the federal government after Congress signed off on President Donald Trump’s demands to stop supporting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
About a dozen journalists and a handful of others from throughout the organization were given notice that their jobs were ending at Cascade PBS. Similar news is hitting public broadcasting stations around the nation, or will be soon.
I cautiously sang the praises of the nonprofit approach when, in December 2019, I joined Crosscut. It was a few years earlier, in 2015, when Crosscut merged with public TV station KCTS-9. We were at the cutting edge of a movement to combine in-depth journalism with the financial might of local NPR and PBS stations.
I told my friends and my team of talented journalists that Crosscut could continue indefinitely its important work covering the stories the more mainstream media didn’t have time to focus on because we were attached to the PBS station. Who doesn’t love Elmo with their donation dollars?
We paid our reporters decently. We had a dumpy, yet centrally located office, which was upgraded to beautiful new headquarters last year. And the bosses left coverage decisions to me and the other journalists.
Flash forward to this week, and many loyal readers, as well as journalists around the state, are in mourning. Elmo couldn’t save Crosscut. And neither could the donors who dug deep after they heard of congressional action to rescind federal funding already committed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Others blame Cascade PBS leadership for making the wrong choice. I’m not going to debate that decision because it is being aired thoroughly elsewhere, and I wasn’t in the room where it was discussed. But I will push back on the comments from one of my former editors who described the Crosscut experiment as a disappointment that “rarely lived up to its potential.”
Here’s a short list of some ways Crosscut journalists met their potential, doing important journalism outside of the daily grind of the news cycle:

Melissa Santos’ nine-month investigation of the way bad cops kept their jobs in Washington, even though everyone knew they were trouble.
Joseph O’Sullivan’s work with Shauna Sowersby shedding light on secrecy in Olympia under the claim of legislative privilege. 
David Kroman’s investigation into racist allegations at Seattle Children’s Hospital.
The Investigation Team’s watchdogging of federal pandemic aid.
Mai Hoang’s efforts to turn the relatively boring but important topic of redistricting into an explanatory series that made sure regular people understood how it impacted them.
Lilly Ana Fowler’s in-depth coverage of immigrant detention, years before most of us were paying attention.
Hannah Weinberger’s deceptively simple environmental stories on how the changing climate was impacting all of us and her advice on how we could cope.
Plus, there were years of legislative and city hall coverage with too many stories to list by Josh Cohen and others.

This small newsroom kept much larger outlets like The Seattle Times on their toes for nearly two decades and made sure Washingtonians understood how government actions affected their lives.
Seattle Times Executive Editor Michele Matassa Flores, like a lot of prominent journalists working in Seattle today, toiled at Crosscut earlier in her career, working as an editor there from 2010-2011. 
“Crosscut has been an important part of the media landscape here for many years,” Flores wrote in an email. “Just looking at the site right now, Cascade is examining the governor’s early months in office, updating its own investigation over wind energy in Eastern Washington, and providing right reporting on arts and culture. These are stories that provide a true public service.”
She acknowledged that Crosscut helped make Times journalists better while strengthening civic engagement. 
“At such a critical time for our democracy, we need more reporting, more voices, more people watching what our government leaders do. Not fewer,” Flores wrote.
She called the politically motivated cuts to public media funding more than sad. It’s frightening. 
For those vilifying Cascade’s leadership and not the federal government over this decision, I want to make sure you know that Crosscut would have died a decade ago if KCTS didn’t recognize the potential for a meaningful collaboration. That was nearly 10 years of great journalism and growth that would not have happened. 
The last writer and editor from the beginning of Crosscut who still works at Cascade PBS today agrees with me that those years were a gift to the community. 
Knute Berger, known on TV, audio and in print as Mossback but also in the journalism world for his time as editor of The Seattle Weekly, describes the early years: “I was part of the start-up group that David Brewster collected to go forth and try to add something new to the regional media ecosystem.”
Berger recalls that Brewster built a community of writers who were all free agents at the time: freelancers, part-timers, retirees — smart people who wanted an outlet for civically minded journalism.
“And it almost worked until the money ran out, and then KCTS-9 saved the day by taking us in,” Berger wrote in an email, where he offered a long list of journalists who made a difference. 
Casey Corr, another of Crosscut’s original writers, spoke at length about Brewster’s vision and how he attracted talented journalists to work for free, which might have been part of Crosscut’s early formula for success. 
But Corr said it was the way Crosscut approached its reporting and writing that attracted readers and gave the publication legs: a focus on behind the scenes, who was influencing who.
“When I wrote for Crosscut, I felt liberated in the sense that I could tell readers this is how it really works. I never felt that way completely writing for either of the daily newspapers,” Corr said.
One of the publication’s early editors, Joe Copeland, spoke of the news organization’s many “near-death experiences” when nonprofit fundraising fell short and grants ran out. He said the merger with KCTS was more than a financial boost; it was good for Crosscut’s journalism.
“In my experience, the best years at Crosscut were after they combined with KCTS. That opened up opportunities for wider coverage,” Copeland said. 
Corr said the merger didn’t just save Crosscut, it gave something to the public TV station as well, by helping it return to its promise of public service journalism. What is going to happen now, Corr asked.
Berger has a similar concern about journalism in general.
“That it is now kaput is a tough loss for those of us who put heart and soul into it, especially at this time and for the reason that Congress, at Donald Trump’s urging, made the decision to defund public media. We are a casualty of that,” notes Berger. His broadcast work at Cascade PBS is expected to continue, as will other local TV production. I can’t imagine the protest that would form outside the station if he were part of the shutdown.
All the people I spoke with hope others will keep experimenting and not give up on public service journalism. So do I.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cascade-pbs.png,,,2025-09-24 17:58:07.137471

A state panel approved a stipulation with John Helfant stemming from a complaint that he directed a police officer to conduct a death investigation, despite not having the required certification.

A retired police chief from Northfield has agreed to give up his law enforcement certification to avoid a hearing over an unprofessional conduct complaint. The complaint alleged John Helfant improperly directed a police officer from the force to investigate a death more than two years ago despite knowing that the officer was not qualified to do that task.
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council approved a stipulation during a meeting last week with Helfant in which he “voluntarily surrendered” his law certification “with no option of recertification.” 
According to the stipulation, council staff received an unprofessional conduct complaint against Helfant related to an incident in January 2023 when he allegedly directed a police officer, Brian Gosselin, to continue an untimely death investigation when he was not certified to perform such an investigation.
“By this direction,” the stipulation stated, “(Helfant) knowingly directed an individual to conduct an investigation beyond their scope of practice.”
Gosselin’s training limited him to responding to alleged crimes in progress and lower-level offenses.
A hearing on Helfant’s certification could have taken place before the full council, according to Christopher Brickell, the Vermont Criminal Justice Council executive director, but did not as a result of the stipulation.

“In the interest of resolving this matter,” the filing stated, “(Helfant) and the State agree to enter this Stipulation and Consent Order, in lieu of proceeding to hearing.” 
Helfant, reached Wednesday, said he agreed to voluntarily surrender law enforcement certification because he had retired from law enforcement more than two years ago.
“I don’t need it anymore,” he said of his law enforcement certification. 
Helfant said the incident happened more than two years ago and he had no memory of it.
Helfant said it wasn’t worth challenging the allegation.
“I don’t need my certification. I haven’t been a cop since June of 2023 and have no intention of being one again,” Helfant said.
Helfant, a former longtime member of the Vermont State Police, served roughly four years as Northfield police chief before retiring in 2023. 
While Helfant was working in law enforcement, the Washington County state’s attorney at the time, Rory Thibault, wrote what are known as Brady or Giglio letters in 2019 to defense lawyers that laid out concerns he had with Helfant’s credibility stemming from his conduct during traffic stops.
In one of the cases, the prosecutor threw out a drug case in 2019 when he couldn’t reconcile information from Helfant’s affidavit with body cam footage. Helfant denied any wrongdoing.
Helfant’s retirement as Northfield police chief in 2023 came shortly after several organizations called for his removal in light of credibility issues that had been raised and Helfant’s public statements disapproving of the local school district’s policies on the rights of transgender students. 
At the time, Helfant denied that he was pressured into retiring, writing on a Northfield group Facebook page, “I could stay, but a bum shoulder that has me on light duty for the foreseeable future and 33yrs in VT Law Enforcement, just makes me want to do something different. It would be nice to be my own boss and take a break from supervising and managing others.”

Sept. 24, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceOn Wednesday, health care providers and drug manufacturers hotly debated legislation looking to ensure hospitals can purchase drugs at a reduced price as part of a federal program intended to support facilities that care for uninsured or low-income patients. 
Members of the Michigan House Health Policy Committee on Wednesday heard testimony on House Bill 4878, which the committee chair and sponsor, state Rep. Curt VanderWall (R-Ludington), called a common sense response on a complicated topic. 
The bill bars drug manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors from imposing conditions, restrictions, limits or outright bans on entities participating in the 340B drug pricing program and their contracting pharmacies that prevent them from acquiring certain medications at a discount.

Additionally, the bill aims to bring more transparency into the size and scope of the program in Michigan by requiring participants to report how much money they receive through the program, how much they pay pharmacies and consultants, their total profits and how much they spend on community care. 
“We believe this reporting will give us a clear picture of the program in Michigan and gives a chance for our healthcare providers to brag about the impact they have on their communities, but it will also shine a light on whether there is, in fact, waste, fraud and abuse in this program,” VanderWall said. 
VanderWall opened testimony on the bills by welcoming representatives from the Michigan Health and Hospital Association to discuss their support for the policy. 
Chip Falahee, the senior vice president of legal and legislative affairs for  Bronson Healthcare, said the program has enabled hospitals to stretch scarce federal resources across a wider group of people. 
Participants consist of facilities who see a high percentage of Medicaid  recipients, as well as children’s hospitals, cancer hospitals, rural referral centers and critical access hospitals, Falahee explained.

Facilities can use the money they save through 340B for a number of services, with Falahee pointing to investments in rural OB-GYN and cancer clinics, mental health and addiction services, and mobile clinics as some examples. 
“In Bronson’s case, [to] give you a specific example, we use that money, those savings, to fund patient assistance programs to offer no charge medications to our low-income and uninsured patients. We also provide oncology medicines for our uninsured cancer patients,” Falahee said. 
By protecting contract pharmacies from restrictions instituted by drug manufacturers, the bill allows the program to function as originally intended, Falahee said, emphasizing that the program runs on private dollars rather than federal funding. 
However, representatives from the pharmaceutical industry argued the program has been exploited to generate profits for large hospital systems, pharmacy benefit managers and chain pharmacies, rather than acting as a safety net for hospitals. 
Emily Gibellina, director of state government affairs for the Midwest region for the pharmaceutical research and development company AbbVie argued the state had no business passing legislation on 340B, as it is a federal program. 
She also argued that the entities covered by the program are left to self-police their claims and that manufacturers are required to pay out discounts on an honor system, without itemized receipts or insight into whether claims may be eligible, or duplicated.
Leslie Baldwin, the co-founder, CEO and president of the Michigan Rare Coalition, a nonprofit focused on advocating for individuals with rare disorders, raised similar transparency concerns, questioning how much money hospitals were making off 340B and how much of that money was going to support patients’ programs.

She also raised concerns about the bill’s language on transparency, which requires hospitals to report their 340B transactions to a hospital trade association contracted with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
“The current language allows the state hospital trade association to oversee the collection and reporting of data, as well as hiding the name of the hospitals that submit that information by de-identifying it. This undercuts the efforts to require meaningful transparency,” Baldwin said. 
While opponents questioned whether 340B discounts were truly used to benefit patients, Frank Waters, the senior director of policy and government affairs for the Michigan Primary Care Association emphasized the money saved is required to go back into patient care. 
Opponents also credited the 340B program with driving up the cost of care, partly through the purchase of higher priced drugs over lower-cost generics, though Kelli Pardee, the Pharmacy Business Director at Great Lakes Bay Health Centers, said they are required to charge all insurance companies the same amount, with the exception of fee-for-service Medicaid. 
“We don’t charge differently for a 340B drug than a non-340B drug because we can’t. We charge the same to everybody. And where we’re required to charge less, in the case of fee-for-service Medicaid, we make no dollars on those and we charge the state the 340B price,” Pardee said. 
The committee did not vote on the policy, with VanderWall leaving the bill open to potential amendments following testimony.

A week after ABC pulled his show off the air under pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, the comedian Jimmy Kimmel made a return to late-night TV screens Tuesday night — but not in Vermont, among dozens of other markets nationwide.
In Vermont, Jimmy Kimmel Live! airs on the local ABC affiliate WVNY. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, a national company that earlier on Tuesday announced its local stations would continue to keep Kimmel’s show off the air. 
WVNY is one of nearly 70 local stations across the country that was slated to not broadcast Kimmel’s show on Tuesday, including stations serving Albany, New Orleans and Seattle. Some of those stations are also owned by Nexstar, while others are owned by another national company, Sinclair Broadcast Group.
Vermont’s local affiliate is branded as ABC22 or MyChamplainValley. 
ABC’s parent company, Disney, decided to pull Kimmel’s show off the air last week after the host made comments during a Sept. 15 monologue that seemed to link the person who shot and killed the conservative activist Charlie Kirk the week before with supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. 
Brendan Carr, Trump’s chair of the Federal Communications Commission, criticized Kimmel’s remarks and threatened federal action against ABC affiliates who aired the show. The FCC has authority over the licenses that allow local stations to broadcast on public airwaves.
“Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said on a podcast last week. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Disney changed course on Monday, however, after facing intense public backlash to a decision that was seen across the political spectrum as an infringement on constitutional speech protections with little precedent in modern U.S. history. More than 400 celebrities signed an open letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union panning “government threats to our freedom of speech” in the wake of Kimmel’s suspension.
On Tuesday, however, Nexstar said in a statement that it stood by the initial decision to pull Kimmel’s show and would continue to forgo the program “pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”
Nexstar noted that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would still be available on Disney-owned streaming services while, in the meantime, its TV stations “will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”
MyChamplainValley’s general manager, Tina Castano, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.
In his show Tuesday night, which is available to watch in full on YouTube, Kimmel said it was not his intention to blame any one group of people for Kirk’s killing — though said he could see how his comments would have made people upset.
He also connected the program’s muzzling to broader concerns about censorship.
“This show is not important,” Kimmel said. “What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Federal officials have not yet made public the list of hazardous materials present at a Tangipahoa Parish petroleum products plant that caught fire and exploded last month, saying that doing so might reveal “confidential business information.”
The Environmental Protection Agency, which has led disaster response efforts and all public communications since the Aug. 22 incident, has known for weeks which specific hazardous and radioactive materials were present at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Roseland. After the Illuminator repeatedly requested information about the materials, the EPA acknowledged it had such a list but refused to provide a copy, saying the agency needed to first clear it with Smitty’s Supply.
“On Aug. 27, Smitty’s, through its legal counsel, provided EPA with an inventory list of their products and materials at their facility near Roseland,” EPA Press Officer Kellen Ashford wrote Friday in an email. “EPA has worked with Smitty’s to verify the accuracy of the list. However, a question remains on whether the list contains Confidential Business Information (CBI).”
The EPA said it is following federal laws that prohibit the public release of confidential business information or what could be considered trade secrets, which are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other laws.
Ashford said the agency has asked Smitty’s Supply whether its inventory list should be considered confidential.
“We are currently waiting for their response,” he said.
Records the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has posted on its website list some of the chemicals at Smitty’s Supply, but it’s unclear if it’s a comprehensive list. The state agency also doesn’t distinguish whether the listed chemicals were involved in the fire.
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade environmental advocacy group, said it seems like the EPA is making more of an effort to keep the inventory list from the public than Smitty’s Supply.
“Every action they are taking makes it suspicious,” Gibb said. “Why would they not ask on day one if it was confidential? Also, surely when the population is sprayed with the content of the inventory, surely the EPA’s duty at this stage is to inform the population as soon as they received the information. It definitely seems to lack transparency.”
The Illuminator’s calls and emails to Smitty’s Supply have gone unanswered.
Oily residue covered surrounding homes, farms and businesses from the Aug. 22 fire, which took two weeks to fully extinguish. Cleanup crews have so far recovered 5.6 million gallons of contaminated material from the site and nearby waterways such as the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records mention some of the hazardous materials known to be on site, including naphthalene, xylene, ethylene glycol and phosphoric acid, all of which have applications in the automotive industry. The state agency has ceded authority to the EPA for the government’s response to the fire.
Estimates of the cleanup costs associated with the Smitty’s Supply fire have climbed past $39 million, according to state records. The company is responsible for covering the expense.
EPA adjusts allowable pollution levels for fire
The EPA has said repeatedly the pollution from the Smitty’s Supply explosion and fire poses no imminent danger to the public.
The agency notes its fine particulate matter readings were below the special levels threshold it established specifically for the incident — 300 micrograms per cubic meter of air — but it has not said how or why it established that limit, which is much higher than standard pollution allowances.
Gibb said she’s never heard of a threshold being set that high before.
For emergency incidents, fine particulate matter over 250.5 micrograms in a 24-hour period are considered hazardous, according to the EPA’s air monitoring guidelines for fires.

Toxic fine particulate matter, even during short exposure periods, can lead to heart attacks, asthma attacks, cancer and other health risks, according to an EPA fact sheet. The agency has regulated particulate matter pollution since 1971 and has revised its standards four times since then.
Gibb said the 300-microgram threshold for the Smitty’s Supply fire is more than 30 times higher than the EPA’s normal safety threshold. She noted air monitoring readings far exceeded normal standards several days following the explosion.
Mobile air monitoring readings outside the facility reached a high of 250 micrograms two days into the fire, according to the data on the EPA’s incident website for Smitty’s Supply.
After the Aug. 24 reading, the EPA paused its mobile air monitoring for nearly 10 hours. Typically, the air monitors take readings roughly every five minutes. When asked about the 10-hour gap, the agency said the air monitors needed to be recalibrated. Other interval gaps in the monitoring data prior to that one lasted around four hours, the EPA website shows.
“Real-time air monitoring requires frequent calibration of instruments due to changing environmental conditions,” Ashford said. “During the active firefighting operations at the site, site conditions changed that resulted in changes to the air monitoring activities, which created time intervals where air monitoring was not active.”
Water testing reveals toxins
Water samples the EPA collected from a pond and a ditch near the facility showed elevated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, according to a lab report the EPA initially posted on its incident site. PAHs, as they are more commonly known, are produced when fossil fuels are burned. They have been linked to a range of health disorders, including cancer and blood and liver abnormalities, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The water samples also contained elevated levels of heavy metals including arsenic, barium and lead, the lab report said. The levels were higher than what’s allowed in drinking water, though it’s unclear whether the EPA used a different threshold for its water sampling.
Susan Richardson, an analytical chemist from the University of South Carolina who reviewed the findings, said the lack of information and adequate sampling makes it difficult to truly assess the risk to the community.
“What was deposited in the water in that ditch could be indicative of what was in the air and what could be deposited on the ground and other surfaces (homes, vehicles, etc.),” Richardson said.
Industrial X-ray machine still missing
EPA, through its public statements and online hub site, also did not publicly disclose that five fill-level gauges containing radioactive material were present at the facility. Officials said all have been recovered and were undamaged, but a team of radiation inspectors spent two weeks searching for what they thought was a missing sixth gauge. On Friday, the EPA realized a mistake had been made and that the missing device was actually an industrial X-ray machine.
The material in the gauges is Americium 241, a manmade radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactor fission. It is also used in minute amounts in household smoke detectors. It emits alpha and low-level gamma radiation that can penetrate the human skin, but Americium 241 is typically only harmful after prolonged exposure or when ingested or inhaled, according to the CDC.
State officials notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the situation at Smitty’s Supply Aug. 26 and reported each gauge contained 100 millicuries of Americium 241 — more than a thousand times the amount found in smoke detectors.
Officials initially thought there was a sixth gauge missing but gave up looking for the purported sixth gauge on Sept. 11, state records show.
“As there was no risk of exposure to the public from the five devices containing radioactive materials, EPA continued response operations,” EPA press officer Edward Mekeel said in an email.
About a week later, the EPA learned from Smitty’s Supply that an X-ray machine, and not another gauge, was missing. X-ray machines only produce radiation when they are in use.
“The devices and X-ray machines look similar,” Mekeel said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Frank Menniti shares lab space for his work as chief science officer for a company developing a new drug for Alzheimer’s disease. 
But soon Menniti will have his own pad: The company MindImmune Therapeutics will have new office and research space at Ocean State Labs in Providence, as one of five life science companies selected for the facilities’ inaugural cohort. A roster of state leaders convened Wednesday morning at the labs on Richmond Street in Providence to announce and celebrate the five companies expected to begin using the sparkly new lab spaces early next year.
Menniti went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And while people say Cambridge is the place to be for cutting-edge scientific research, the city “is not all it’s cracked up to be,” Menniti told reporters.
“This seems like a much better place to be able to thrive,” Menniti said of Providence, citing its central location and closeness to other research centers. “It’s simpler to get around. The quality of the science, the quality of the academics, is every bit as good as it is in Boston, and I went to MIT, so I kind of know. So to us this is like the perfect place to be.”
The Ocean State Labs comprises 30,000 square feet of wet lab and office space. It’s one initiative of the quasi-public Rhode Island Life Science Hub, which was authorized by a $45 million, three-year infusion from state lawmakers in 2023. The hub spent a chunk of 2024 shaping its board and leadership, and the Rhode Island Senate finally named Dr. Mark  A. Turco as its CEO and president in .
“With our five anchor member companies and a healthy pipeline of potential new member companies and the scientific and technology development being done in our region, we are primed for success,” Turco told the crowd of a few dozen people.
Turco said the plan is to have 60 to 80% of the available lab spaces filled within one year of the labs’ scheduled opening in January. The space can accommodate up to 20 or 30 companies. 
In addition to MindImmune, the initial cohort includes:

Pax Therapeutics, which had its start in Rhode Island Hospital labs, and is working on gene-delivery technology to aid ligament and tendon healing to improve mobility.
XM Therapeutics, a Providence-based biotech firm focused on creating therapies that can repair dysfunctions in the extracellular matrix, involved in conditions that affect organs like the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and more.
P53 Therapeutics, a company developing antitumor drugs that target p53, a gene whose mutations are implicated in some cancers.
OncoLux, which is working on optical imaging and AI tools that can guide cancer surgery.

Also in attendance at Wednesday’s event was Gov. Dan McKee, who posed the labs as a crown jewel in his efforts to develop the state’s economy and workforce. 
“Thirty-six thousand new private sector jobs have been added in the last four years, and this project is right at the center of what we’re doing,” McKee said.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also attended, as did Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat who stood in for Senate President Valarie Lawson, who was unable to attend.

Expanding life sciences capacity
The 150 Richmond Street building will share tenancy with the Rhode Island State Health Laboratory and spaces rented by Brown University. The Life Science Labs will be managed by Portal Innovations, a venture capital firm that runs similar spaces in Chicago, South Boston, Houston, and Atlanta.
John Flavin, the CEO of Portal Innovations, said Big Pharma looks to his company “to try to identify up-and-coming ecosystems that don’t have boots on the ground yet, but are promising in terms of the science.”  
That outside interest is already here, Turco said, noting that a firm from Perth, Australia, visited the state this week to explore a possible presence here. Turco added later that the labs will hopefully form part of a longer pipeline that will keep university and local in-state.
“A lot of the companies that will be coming out of our academic institutions and health systems, hopefully will now be able to be housed here in Rhode Island,” Turco said, adding that companies which “translate out of our academic institutions will be in the incubator for around 18 to 24 months.”
“And then what we want to do is have space for those companies once they have scale to continue to scale, right here in Rhode Island, as opposed to going to other states in the country,” Turco said.
The team at MindImmune certainly wants to stay in the state. They’re working on a biologic drug that seeks to target and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Recent research has implicated immune system disorder and the resulting inflammation as drivers in dementias.
Robert Nelson, the company’s vice president, said the drug is based on research that suggests immune cells implicated in Alzheimer’s “actually come in from the blood into the brain, and we found a way to keep them out of the brain.”
“The idea, very simply, is, if we can stop that inflammatory response in the brain by keeping the cells from going there in the first place, we’ll have individuals who may still have a head full of plaques, but they are still cognitive,” Nelson said.
Menniti said that MindImmune’s drug, currently known by the codename MITI-101, is a humanized antibody — a drug made from living cells, and the basis of all biologic therapies, which require special handling and storage and work differently from so-called “small molecule” drugs often taken orally.
Biologic drugs have multiplied in the past two decades, firming up clinical options for treating cancers and chronic illnesses which involve the immune system, such as psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, and lupus. A 2023 chart from The Antibody Society shows that antibody-based drugs have received increasingly more approvals by federal regulators since 2000. 
Menniti said the company is developing its cell line that will make the antibodies, after which the drug can undergo toxicity studies. He expects that, if all goes according to plan, the company will be able to apply for Investigational New Drug status late next year — the first step in getting a drug to undergo the clinical trials that precede possible federal approval and marketing. 
Menniti is not sure yet if the company will relinquish its current lab space at the University of Rhode Island (URI). What does MindImmune intend to do at the Providence labs anyway?
The same thing it does at URI, Menniti said: Take slices of brain, expose them to antibodies and dyes, then generate and evaluate pictures for an antibody’s possible usefulness. 
The process involves a lot of microscope slides, Menniti said — so many, in fact, that he told reporters his title is usually “Chief Slide Officer.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A Florida judge Wednesday permanently closed the city of South Miami’s case to determine whether cities must enter into partnerships with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, adding that future attempts would be “futile.”
Jonathan Sjostrom, chief judge for the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, sided with Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier by agreeing to dismiss with prejudice South Miami’s case questioning whether cities and towns must enter into ICE partnerships, called 287(g) agreements.
Although the ruling doesn’t weigh in on whether cities must enter into the partnerships, Sjostrom was clear that South Miami had no ground for a case.
“This City’s lawsuit, at least, is premature,” Sjostrom wrote in the Wednesday afternoon decision. “This is a fairly straightforward case, despite the length and complexity of the [city’s] Complaint. Given the relative simplicity of the actual circumstances alleged, this court concludes that additional attempts to plead would be futile.”
This is only the latest legal win for the state in the immigration sphere. Earlier this month, a federal appellate court reversed a lower court’s decision to shut down the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, handing a massive win to DeSantis and Uthmeier. Florida now has two large detention centers in partnership with ICE, “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot,” and is working on opening a “Panhandle Pokey.”
Why did South Miami sue?
South Miami, under Mayor Javier Fernandez, was the first city to file suit in March against the DeSantis administration to determine whether local governments must enter into 287(g) agreements, which deputize state and local officers as federal immigration authorities. This challenge stemmed from the GOP-dominated Legislature passing a February law requiring counties and sheriffs to enter into these partnerships.
In oral arguments, the state’s lawyers argued that although cities aren’t explicitly required to enter into 287(g) agreements, they’re not allowed to purposely cancel the partnerships once they’ve been enacted. They argue that this constitutes active defiance of Florida’s new law mandating cities use their “best efforts” to combat illegal immigration and qualifies the city as a sanctuary state.
South Miami, meanwhile, accused Uthmeier of politically pressuring cities like Key West and Fort Myers, which had voted to disband 287(g) agreements. They received threatening letters from Uthmeier and reversed course.
Sjostrom — who declined to rule on whether a city receiving Uthmeier’s letter could ask for relief — said South Miami had no ground to cite these letters because it had never received one.
“This court expresses no views as to whether a City that receives a letter … would present a case or controversy sufficient for declaratory relief. But the letter does not create a case or controversy for a City to whom no such letter was directed,” Sjostrom wrote. “Political pressure applied by political actors to other political actors provides no basis for judicial intervention.”
‘Nothing we’re planning to do other than nothing’
South Miami has yet to enter any of its officials into a 287(g) agreement and, according to Mayor Fernandez, they don’t plan on it either.
“What we’ve learned from [this case] is that as long as we don’t do anything, we’re not in jeopardy,” Fernandez told the Florida Phoenix. “The ball is in the governor’s and attorney general’s court. If they believe that by doing nothing that we’re in violation … then I think we would have further legal standing.”
“In the absence of their action, there’s nothing we’re planning to do other than doing nothing,” he continued. “We’ve gotten the clarity we need.”
Sjostrom granted the state’s request to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the matter is permanently closed.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The head of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole is retiring after a storied state career that included some high profile positions.
Tom Bates’ retirement is effective Nov. 30, ending 26 years of public service.
“I’ve had the opportunity at each place to lead some really incredible teams of incredible people who did great work on behalf of the people of the state of Oklahoma,” Bates said. “I hope the people of Oklahoma realize how blessed they are to have so many trained and dedicated professionals working in state government, looking out for them every day.”
Bates, 56, previously worked as an assistant attorney general in the consumer protection unit and chief of the multi-county grand jury under former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson.
Edmondson described Bates as “top notch” and one of the best lawyers he ever had on staff.
“He is someone I called upon on many occasions when we really needed a strong person in a position,” Edmondson said. “He was good. He was careful. And he invariably solved the unsolvable problem I dumped in his lap.”
Under former Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Bates served as chief of the Public Protection Unit and first assistant attorney general.
He took a sabbatical when his late wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, but returned to state service working as a special advisor to former Gov. Mary Fallin. 
He oversaw the implementation of the Pinnacle Plan, which was the product of a settlement agreement to resolve a class action lawsuit challenging how the state provided care for foster care children in its custody.
He was then tapped as interim commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which was in the midst of financial turmoil. While he was there, he oversaw the implementation of a state question that legalized medical marijuana.
In 2019, Gov. Kevin Stitt tapped Bates to lead a new initiative, dubbed “Front Porch,” to integrate services provided by the state’s health and human service agencies.
He has led the Pardon and Parole Board for five years, arriving at a time when the agency had a backlog of 3,000 commutation cases and the state was coming out of a moratorium on the death penalty.
During his time with that agency, he has overseen 18 clemency cases involving death row inmates.
“Victims’ families are reliving those situations, those events, those horrible events that led to the loss of someone’s life,” Bates said. “They are hard on board members. They are hard on staff.”
While death penalty cases typically get media attention, other murder cases are every bit as difficult for the agency’s board and staff, he said.
Last month, the Pardon and Parole Board had 41 first-degree murder cases on its docket, Bates said.
Bates said the appointed five-member Pardon and Parole Board needs a pay increase.
He’s asked lawmakers to raise the pay from about $22,000 to close to $50,000, “which is still a bargain for the work these board members do.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond called Bates the “quintessential public servant.”
“His breadth of experience in Oklahoma state government is extraordinary, and throughout his career he served with the utmost integrity, professionalism and commitment to the people of Oklahoma,” Drummond said. 
Bates said he and his wife plan to travel after retirement 
He said that he may eventually return to practicing law.

Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, during a Sept. 24, 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas is one step closer to understanding the feasibility of building more nuclear power to address its growing electricity needs, after the legislature’s Joint Energy Committee approved a contract for a consultant to study the matter Wednesday.
Among other things, the consultant will examine whether small, modular nuclear reactors or microreactors would be feasible in Arkansas.
The year-long contract, which will be executed and paid for by the Bureau of Legislative Research, will cost no more than $305,000. It will still need to be approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee on Thursday, before going before ALC Friday for a final vote.
Committee members directed BLR to begin negotiating a contract with Maryland-based EXCEL Services Corporation in June. Act 707 of 2025 directed the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment to study the feasibility of building more nuclear power, but due to a lack of funding, the committee opted to do it instead.
Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source

If the contract is approved, the feasibility study will determine the economic and environmental impacts of nuclear expansion “without limitation,” according to a draft. It will also make recommendations on “optimal design specifications,” location criteria, safety criteria, potential policy changes and job, tax and supply chain impacts of building more nuclear power.
The state’s only nuclear power plant, Arkansas Nuclear One, located near Russellville, already provides enough power for roughly 56% of Entergy Arkansas’ 730,000 customers, according to Entergy’s website.
Nationally, nuclear power — especially from modular reactors — has been gaining new, bipartisan looks as the need for electricity grows due to artificial intelligence and data centers, both of which require massive amounts of electricity.
The move to enter into the contract comes as Arkansas tries to keep up with other states eyeing nuclear power. Texas passed legislation earlier this year investing $350 million in nuclear expansion, while Three Mile Island — a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania that partially melted down in 1979 and closed in 2019 — is set to be brought back online to power AI data centers for Microsoft.

(File photo from Getty Images)October 2024, at what should have been a joyful nine-week ultrasound, I learned that my pregnancy had stopped developing three weeks earlier.
My doctor explained that the pregnancy was not viable. I was devastated — but the nightmare didn’t end there.
Because of South Carolina’s six-week abortion ban, my doctor would not treat me for a miscarriage until I underwent a second ultrasound 11 days later to confirm what we already knew: There was no heartbeat, and my pregnancy was over.
Each day that passed while I carried my nonviable pregnancy put me at increasing risk of infection, sepsis, and even death.
Women in other states with abortion bans, like Texas and Georgia, have already died under similar circumstances. South Carolina shouldn’t be next.
I needed a common medical procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C) to complete my miscarriage. Reasons for a D&C include miscarriage and abortion treatment.
Under our state’s laws, doctors who provide an illegal abortion face the threat of losing their medical license, a $10,000 fine, and even jail time.
I remembered thinking I should qualify for the procedure because my pregnancy was non-viable.
However, terrified for his own livelihood, my doctor told me he could not help me. So, while grieving my loss, I had to travel to Virginia and pay $3,000 out of pocket to get the care I desperately needed.
Now, lawmakers are considering S.323, a bill that would take things even further — stripping away the few remaining exceptions and putting more women and girls in danger.
If this bill passes, more people will be forced to leave the state or sit at home and hope their bodies do not become septic while waiting for a miscarriage to pass naturally. Some won’t make it.
I was fortunate to have the resources and support to travel. Many South Carolina women do not.
Those without the means will be left to risk their fertility, their health, and their lives because politicians decided their suffering was an acceptable price for a political talking point.
This isn’t just about people like me.
Under S.323, a sixth-grade girl could be forced to give birth after being raped by a family member. A mother of two could be forced to carry a pregnancy with a fatal fetal anomaly, only to watch her baby die shortly after birth.
These aren’t hypotheticals — they are the brutal, real-world consequences of laws like this.
Today, I am in my third trimester of a new pregnancy, and while I am deeply grateful, I remain painfully aware of how fragile pregnancy can be.
Every appointment brings both joy and anxiety, and I can’t help but think about how easily I — or anyone else — could face another crisis.
If something goes wrong again, I could find myself right back where I was last year: begging for care that my own state refuses to provide.
South Carolina lawmakers like to claim they are “protecting life.”
But S.323 would do the opposite: endanger women, girls, and families across our state.
The decision to end a pregnancy should belong to patients and their doctors — not politicians who will never face these terrifying moments themselves.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER — A group of Florida voters urged the Pinellas County legislative delegation on Wednesday to oppose an effort led by Gov. Ron DeSantis to pursue a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan designed to keep the U.S. House in Republican control in 2026.
“Floridians have clearly said that they don’t want partisan gerrymandering,” said Amy Weintraub, of the League of Women Voters St. Petersburg branch, referring to the Fair Districts amendments passed by 63% of Florida registered voters in 2010.
The measures say in part that “no apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
Weintraub was one of more than 130 people who originally signed up to comment to the nine-member Pinellas County legislative delegation who gathered at the Clearwater branch of St. Petersburg College (only eight were in attendance, with Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross absent). It’s a ritual being played out in all 67 counties in Florida in advance of the regular legislative session that begins in January.
“Floridians passed the Fair District Amendments to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in redistricting,” said Simon Adams, field manager for the group Equal Ground. “These laws must be respected. To ignore them is to ignore the will of the people.”
“Redistricting should be about ensuring that every person’s voice counts equally,” added Geveryl Robinson with the group Black Voters Matter. “Fair maps means that neighborhoods are kept whole. That communities of interest are not spread apart, and that elected officials are accountable to the people they serve, not partisan interests. When lines are drawn unfairly, it undermines trust in the process, weakens voters confidence, and ultimately harms our democracy.”
Gov. DeSantis never mentioned the idea of redrawing Florida’s congressional map this year until late July. That was shortly after President Donald Trump, fearful that the GOP could lose its narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representative in the 2026 midterm elections, called on Texas and other red states to redraw their congressional boundaries to bolster the Republicans’ margins next year.
No government is further along with the process than the Lone Star State. Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new congressional map into law at the end of last month designed to give the GOP five more seats (groups representing Black and Latino voters have filed lawsuits asking that the maps be blocked from going into effect). In Missouri, Republicans have advanced measures to bring a referendum on a new congressional map next year.
The only blue state to move on the matter is California, where lawmakers have approved a proposal that will go before the voters this November asking them to approve a congressional redistricting map that would likely add more Democratic seats.
At least one chamber of Florida’s Legislature is good with DeSantis’ proposal for redistricting ahead of next year’s midterms. House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month that he has created a selection committee on congressional redistricting. It has yet to meet but is likely to do so later this fall (Senate President Ben Albritton has not assigned a similar committee in his chamber).
The sentiment expressed against a mid-decade congressional redistricting echoes the overall opinions of Floridians when asked about the issue.
A public opinion survey commissioned by Common Cause earlier this month found that a majority of Floridians – 55% – oppose such an effort, with only 26% in support and  another 19% undecided. Among Republicans, 45% oppose the measure, with only 36% supporting it. Among political independent voters, 60% are against a congressional redistricted map in 2026.
Tanya Landry, president of the League of Women Voters of North Pinellas County, said that her organization remains committed to empowering voters and defending democracy.
“Today I rise to honor that mission by standing firmly against mid-cycle redistricting,” she said to whoops from the crowd. “Mid-cycle redistricting threatens the very foundation of fair representation. When district lines are changed during the middle of an election cycle, it undermines stability, fairness, and public trust in our democracy in a number of ways. First and foremost, it destabilizes the electoral process. Voters deserve to know who represents them for the duration of a cycle.”
Florida has 28 members in the U.S. House: 20 of them are Republicans and 8 are Democrats.
While the stated opposition to a mid-decade congressional district map elicited the largest cheers from the audience, there were a couple of other issues that received criticism from attendees.
Senate bill 180 also a focus
One was Senate Bill 180, the piece of legislation sponsored by Pinellas Republican Nick DiCeglie (who was voted chair of the delegation for the coming year by his colleagues) aimed primary to streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination following a major storm.
However, a provision that bars new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery, has raised the ire of more than a dozen local governments that have indicated they intend to sue to have the law repealed.
“The original intent of that bill is good policy, and we support most of the provisions in Senate Bill 180,” said Haley Busch, a staff member with 1000 Friends of Florida. But she said that two particular provisions that prohibit updates to comprehensive plans, zoning, or development rules deemed to be “burdensome” is a real problem.
“In practice, this blocks local governments from adopting critical measures like stronger flood plain protections and stormwater protections, or requiring water and sewer connections, leaving communities more vulnerable,” she said. “And it also invites lawsuits that strips citizens of their ability to shape their community’s future growth. So, we don’t think that’s what this Legislature intended. We’re looking to work with senators and representatives to make some changes to the bill.”
Concerns expressed on potential ban on vaccine mandates
Another proposal that the public gathered in Clearwater clearly isn’t for is the measure announced by DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo to eliminate vaccine mandates in the Sunshine State.
“I urge you to stop the surgeon general from eliminating the required vaccines by codifying in the statutes all vaccines in section 1003.22,” said John Bowen, a retired school board attorney. “I also urge you to vote against any proposal to eliminate the immunizations in the statute. Please do not ignore all the existing medical evidence showing the effect of this vaccine over the past several decades.”
Another Pinellas resident was more succinct.
“Please fire the Florida surgeon general,” Johna Holloway, speaking as an individual, said to large cheers from the crowd, referring to Ladapo.

Laura Kelly says Republicans in Congress should work with Democrats to roll back health care cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She is seen here at a July 9, 2025, news conference at Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly warned Wednesday that the loss of Affordable Care Act Marketplace tax credits will have “disastrous effects” on health care unless they are restored by Congress before enrollment begins Nov. 1.
Her remarks came as a new report predicts 108,000 Kansans will lose their Marketplace coverage because of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this year.
Speaking at a news conference as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, Kelly called on Republicans to work with Democrats to restore the ACA Marketplace tax credits as part of a deal to avoid a shutdown of the federal government.
“Republicans have the opportunity to come to the table and negotiate a bipartisan bill in good faith that meets the needs of American people and prevents health care costs from skyrocketing because of the changes they made in the ‘one big, ugly bill.’ If they don’t, the consequences for the people we serve will be devastating,” Kelly said.
Democrats hope to leverage resentment for the so-called “big, beautiful bill” to force Republicans to restore cuts that could strip health insurance from 16 million Americans. Republicans control both the U.S. House and Senate but can’t pass a short-term spending plan without help from the Democrats. If the two sides can’t reach a deal, the federal government could shut down by the end of the month.
Kelly joined Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call attention to the ramifications of letting ACA Marketplace tax credits expire.
“For folks in rural communities like the many we have here in Kansas, access to health care has been further stripped away as rural hospitals face budget cuts that force them to shut down,” she said.
“And it’s the families in these rural towns who will have to face the life-threatening consequences of these closures,” she added. “It shouldn’t be that way, and it doesn’t have to be that way.”
The United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and REACH Healthcare Foundation released a report that shows more than 200,000 Kansans — at least 7% of the population in 45 of the state’s 105 counties — are currently enrolled in the ACA Marketplace. But 108,000 Kansans are expected to lose their Marketplace coverage over the next 10 years as costs increase by 77%, the report said.
The federal government offsets the costs of Marketplace health care plans by providing premium tax credits. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, those credits will expire this year.
“The bottom line is that the cost of health care is going to go up for tens of thousands of Kansans if Congress does not act,” said David Jordan, president of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. “The unfortunate reality is that too many of those Kansans will not be able to afford coverage and be forced to go without coverage. This will only lead to an increase in uncompensated care, putting hospitals at greater financial risk and raising costs for everyone else down the road.”
Last week, U.S. Senate Democrats blocked a stopgap spending measure that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Democrats proposed an alternative that would fund the government through Oct. 31 and permanently extend the ACA Marketplace tax credits, and reverse cuts to Medicaid.
The president refused a meeting with Democratic leaders and said in a statement on Truth Social that their plan was “unserious.” The president falsely claimed Democrats were trying to open borders, get rid of consequences for violent criminals, and “essentially create Transgender operations for everybody.”
“We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed,” Trump wrote.
He added: “Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand.”
Kelly said the president’s statement provides an opportunity for members of Congress “to step up and reclaim their role, their responsibility, their power, their authority to be the appropriators.”
“I can’t believe that there aren’t a number of Republicans in Congress, both the House and in the Senate, who would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to their constituents,” Kelly said. “I just can’t believe that many of them did not like this aspect of the ‘big, ugly bill’ and would welcome the opportunity to sit down with Democrats and negotiate a compromise that allows for people to access their health care affordably.”
Meyer, the Delaware governor, said “the status quo is the intersection of cruel and incredibly expensive.” Families will be forced to choose between paying for housing, groceries or health care, he said.
Extending the ACA Marketplace credits “is one of the simplest ways for Congress to bring relief to working American families that, let’s be honest, are already stretched thin,” Meyer said.
“I think we’re here doing this because we think there are Republicans out there who are receptive to this, who are receptive to the people that they serve, all the people that they serve, and understand that if there’s not action taken soon, health care costs are going to spike,” Meyer said. “And that’s bad for their district, that’s bad for their state, and that’s bad for our whole country.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090199-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-24 16:58:16.223045

UA System President Jay Silveria selected Jones to replace the institute’s previous director, Cheryl May, who announced earlier this month she would resign effective Sept. 30. 
In addition to leading the institute, May also chaired the 2018 and 2022 iterations of the Arkansas School Safety Commission, which was created by former Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson. May and her fellow committee members made 56 new recommendations to improve school safety in a report issued in October 2022. 
“Over the course of more than 40 years with the University of Arkansas System, she has played a large role in guiding the Institute’s programs and its work with the law enforcement community. We wish her all the best in her future endeavors,” CJI officials said in a social media post. 
With the appointment of Jones as interim director, Silveria said the UA System would begin a strategic review of CJI “to ensure its effectiveness in serving the state law enforcement community while planning for a search for the next permanent director,” according to the news release.
“It’s clear to me that CJI plays a critical role in education and training for our law enforcement community, and I look forward to working with Kim, the excellent CJI staff, and our law enforcement partners to determine the right strategic direction for the institute moving forward,” Silveria said. “Kim’s wealth of knowledge and experience will be vital to this process.”
As the Education and Training Center’s assistant director, Jones oversaw statewide programs in law enforcement management, forensic sciences, drug training, violence against women initiatives, and the Arkansas Center for School Safety, according to the release.
“I am honored by the trust and confidence President Silveria has placed in me to serve as Interim Director of CJI,” Jones said. “I am fully committed to dedicating my best efforts to this role. I’m especially excited to continue working with the incredible CJI staff and look forward to what we will accomplish together during this time of transition.”
Jones earned her Master of Public Administration from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Philander Smith College, according to the release. She is also a graduate of the Arkansas Leader Executive Management Program, jointly sponsored by CJI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

This concern prompted the longtime Ward 3 councilmember to reintroduce a youth curfew to tamp down on “nocturnal mischief.” The ordinance, passed Tuesday, bars those under the age of 18 from tarrying on streets or highways, in a park, vacant lots or at establishments after 10 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends or during school hours. It contains a few exceptions, such as running an errand for a parent or being en route to or from academic, volunteer or religious activities.
“If we don’t save them, you might be the next victim,” Stokes said. 
The council unanimously passed the ordinance with little discussion on Tuesday night. But it remains to be seen if Jackson can enforce it as the city currently lacks a place for the Jackson Police Department to take children who violate the curfew, according to Pieter Teeuwiseen, the city’s chief administrative officer. 
Stokes suggested JPD take the children to the Henley-Youth-Patton Juvenile Justice Center. 
“We got a whole youth detention center right down the street in front of the post office,” he said. “Let’s utilize it. We had the lieutenant governor trying to give us the county jail. What we can’t do is make excuses.” 
But a federal juvenile justice law prohibits locking up youth who commit what’s called a “status offense” — a non-criminal act such as violating a curfew that is illegal solely because of the offender’s age — in a secure detention facility. 
The city could hold a child who violates the curfew in a community room at Henley-Young, but the child must be free to leave, according to Melissa Milchman, the executive director of the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that assists states in complying with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. 
“This gets very tricky,” Milchman said. “If they are going onto the secure side of the facility, that’s a violation. If they are hanging out in the community room where staff hang out and they are free to leave, it’s not a violation.” 
Youth Court Judge Carlyn Hicks said state law further complicates the matter. Status offenders cannot be held in detention for more than 24 hours without a valid judge’s order, per state statute.
“I plan to follow the letter of the law,” she said. 
Hicks told the council last year that she considered the ordinance “unenforceable,” so JPD did not enforce it last year.
Before passing the ordinance, Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley asked if “everything (is) legally sufficient here” and City Attorney Drew Martin indicated it was. 
In general, research has shown that youth curfews do not affect crime rates. 
“It’s putting resources toward the lowest level of offense, not even a misdemeanor,” Milchman said. “It’s taking away the most critical resource a city has to commit to violence and victimization and districting them on things that are not crime.” 
The city of Jackson has historically struggled to enforce a youth curfew, according to archival newspaper reporting. In 2003, the Northside Sun reported that youth court officials found it difficult to know if a teenager was “in the wrong” for being out at night or if they simply were coming home from work. 
In 2011, the city tried to find a place for the children that was not Henley-Young. As part of the federal government’s longrunning consent decree against the facility, the detention center had been cited for putting youth who had violated the curfew in the same building as criminal offenders.

Teeuwissen raised the issue of where to take the children during a work session earlier this week. On Monday, he told the council that the city would have to find a “non-detention facility” to put the children. 
“This is probably a foolish question but is it possible to just bring them home?” Ward 7 Councilman Kevin Parkinson asked. 
Interim JPD Chief and Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said he “wouldn’t recommend that.” 
“It goes into technically, ‘Are they in custody?’ And once they are in our custody, we assume responsibilities and liabilities involved,” he said. 
This exchange led Teeuwissen to suggest the council involve Hicks in the discussion, but as of Tuesday night, the council had not asked Hicks about reinstituting the ordinance.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23205304/Jackson-City-Council-2.jpg,,,2025-09-24 16:58:16.223045

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Iowa utilities, along with the majority of utilities across the country, scored an F grade in a report from the Sierra Club that rates utilities’ plans to transition to clean energy and to meet increased demand rates through 2035. 
Iowa utility companies said the report “oversimplifies utility planning” and that they are still striving for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while keeping consumer costs low and maintaining reliability.  
In its 2025 “The Dirty Truth Report,” Sierra Club rated the 50 parent companies that own the most fossil fuel generation in the country, along with their 75 operating companies. The utilities were rated on their plans to retire coal by 2030, plans to not build new gas plants through 2035 and plans to build enough clean energy infrastructure to not only replace fossil fuel generation, but to also meet the growing load needs by 2035. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Collectively, U.S. utilities received an F rating for the first time since Sierra Club began the report in 2021. In the past years, utilities overall received a D score. 
The report notes that this year utilities face “dual pressures” via a change in political outlook toward clean energy from the Biden administration to the current Trump administration, which also canceled a number of clean energy incentive programs, and a “surge in projected electricity demand.” 
According to a report from ICF, a global technology provider, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 25% by 2030. By 2050, the report predicts energy demand increases of nearly 80%.
The Sierra Club report attributes “sharply rising” load growth projections to a combination of the energy demand from data centers that power artificial intelligence models and digital infrastructure and the “electrification” of automobiles, buildings and industry. 
“Currently planned clean energy is barely sufficient to replace half of existing coal and gas generation, let alone supply forecast load growth,” the report said. 
While utilities overall scored seven points lower on this year’s report compared to Sierra Club’s 2024 Dirty Truth report, 65% of utilities have improved their clean energy scores, which are based on commitments to solar and wind projects, since 2021. 
But, the report points out, the majority, or 69%, of utilities have worsened their scores in the gas category by planning new natural gas projects. 
These trends fit with Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, and Interstate Power and Light Company, or IPL, owned by Alliant Energy Corp. 
How Iowa utilities stack up
IPL and MidAmerican scored high in the clean energy category. IPL received a 72% and MidAmerican a 52%. But, both companies have natural gas plans that lowered their overall scores. According to the report, IPL has plans for 1,275 megawatts of natural gas generation by 2035 and MidAmerican has plans for 1,164 megawatts by 2035. 


Grades explained:
Different from the traditional school grading system, Sierra Club explains that to earn an A, companies must score a 75 or greater, a B between 50 and 75, a C between 35 and 50, a D between 17.5 and 35 and Fs are reserved for companies that score a 17.5 or lower on the scale. 
A perfect 100 would mean the company committed to: retire all of its coal by 2030, not build any new gas through 2035 and build an amount of new clean energy that would cover existing fossil fuel generation and projected growth by 2035. 


Geoff Greenwood, a spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy, said since 2004, MidAmerican has invested in 7,600 megawatts of wind energy and 141 megawatts of solar energy, with more planned in the works, that makes the company a “renewable energy leader not just in Iowa, but in the country.” 
“MidAmerican’s customers expect and trust us to plan for, and deliver on, providing energy every minute of every day – no matter what – now and in the future,” Greenwood said in an emailed statement. “…When the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine, reliable fuel sources are essential to helping us meet customer demand.” 
Greenwood said MidAmerican’s coal generation was 51.8% lower in 2024 than it was in 2024 and the company “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” 
A spokesperson for Alliant energy said the company has a net-zero emissions goal by 2050, and plans to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040. The spokesperson said Alliant carbon dioxide emissions in 2024 were 39% lower than the company’s 2005 levels. 
“We are implementing our strategic plan to create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve.” 
Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pamela Mackey Taylor said Iowa’s utility companies “keep clinging to gas and coal.” 
“While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water,” Mackey Taylor said in a statement. “It’s time these companies acted in our best interest, and that means phasing out dangerous fossil fuels to save lives and lower bills.”
Iowa utilities must ‘rapidly’ make use of Biden-era renewable credits to reach emissions goals

Greenwood said as part of the company’s “all-of-the-above approach” to meet current and future customer demand, MidAmerican is moving forward with its 2025 Solar Reliability Project, which will add a projected 709 MW of wind by 2027 and 800 MW of solar by 2028 and its planned Orient Energy Center, a natural gas power plant that will be able to deliver 520 MW during critical times. 
“The Sierra Club’s report oversimplifies utility planning and fails to account for regional differences, regulatory frameworks, the real-world challenges of scaling renewable infrastructure, and the unwavering need to serve customers regardless of the circumstances,” Greenwood said. 
“Here in Iowa, MidAmerican’s planning and progress have resulted in reliable electricity with rates that are seventh lowest in (the) country and 44% below the national average, and the recognition that MidAmerican is a renewable energy leader in the U.S.” he said. 
This was the second year IPL received an F. Its parent company, Alliant, received a C in the report. MidAmerican received an F this year after three consecutive years of scoring a D. Its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, scored a D in the latest report. 
Per the report, none of the parent companies garnered an A this year, and just three utility companies scored an A in the 2025 report. According to Sierra Club, 16 utility companies “backtracked” this year on previous climate commitments. The report said this “poor planning” from utilities will result in higher bills for customers. 
“Utilities are still not planning for the clean energy transition at the pace and scale needed to address rising electricity costs or protect public health,” Sierra Club said in the report. “Since our first report five years ago, utilities’ aggregate score has declined by 3 points, moving in the wrong direction at a time when acceleration is critical.”

Taiwan Flour Mills Association President Michael Chang, Director General May Lin of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Seattle, Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke, Idaho Wheat Commission Chairman Cory Kress and Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt attended the deal signing ceremony and exchanged gifts Wednesday in the governor’s office.
Bedke, Chang and Lin said the deal represents a continuation of a longstanding partnership and friendship between Idaho farmers and members of the milling and baking industry in Taiwan.
“We’re very honored here today to have a delegation from the Taiwanese government, as well as the Taiwan Flour Mills Association,” Bedke said during the ceremonies. “They represent a long standing, very vibrant relationship the state of Idaho has had with Taiwan for over 40 years. They are Idaho’s second largest trading partner after Canada, and they’re a very important part of our agricultural markets here.”
 Deal strengthens Taiwan’s decades long bond with Idaho, U.S. trade partners, officials say

Bedke, an Idaho farmer and rancher by trade, said the deal speaks to the quality of wheat produced by Idaho farmers.

Bedke told reporters that the deal means people from all over the world will enjoy eating dim sum in Taiwan that is made from Idaho wheat.
Lin said the new trade agreement strengthens a bond that has developed between Taiwan and its trade partners in the U.S. and Idaho over the past 40 years. Lin said the deal supports Idaho farmers by providing a stable market for wheat and ensures the people of Taiwan will have good food to eat.
“This also represents that both sides have this determination to create a resilient food supply,” Lin said. 
The Taiwan Flour Mills Association imports wheat on behalf of 20 different Taiwanese flour mills, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture said. 
“This agreement is a major win for Idaho agriculture and a testament to the strong partnership we share with Taiwan,” Tewalt said in a written statement. “Taiwan has long been one of Idaho’s most important and reliable trade partners, and their continued trust in the quality of our wheat is a point of pride for our growers and our state.”
The new wheat agreement is one part of a large agricultural partnership between Taiwan and the U.S.
Over the four-year time period from 2026 to 2029, Taiwan will purchase $10.4 billion in U.S. soybeans, corn, wheat and beef, officials said. The wheat provides a source of food security, the corn is critical for livestock feed, soybeans are essential for food processing, while U.S. beef has become a popular choice in Taiwanese steakhouses, officials said. 
Many Taiwanese snacks and noodles are made with U.S. wheat, including Xiaolongbao dumplings.  
“We’re very proud to be in the food business in Taiwan, and that relationship has turned into a friendship,” said Bedke, who has visited Taiwan four times, including most recently last fall. “Our hats are off to the farmers for always providing a predictable, quality product.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 19:54:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Will CT use surplus funds to fill gaps caused by big beautiful bill?,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/ct-one-big-beautiful-bill-cuts/,Connecticut politicians have about a month to decide whether to use surplus funds to repair programs damaged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.,"While Connecticut officials still don’t know how much of a toll massive federal budget cuts ordered in July will take on programs here, time is running out to mount their first line of defense.
Legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont have about one more month to decide whether to use a portion of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to repair some of the social service programs damaged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Otherwise, nearly all those funds will be used to continue reducing the state’s hefty pension debt, and efforts to counter cuts ordered by President Donald Trump and Congress likely will wait until Connecticut’s next fiscal year begins in July 2026.
“While the full impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill is still being understood, it will undoubtedly have a devastating impact on millions of Americans, as well as our economy, all for the sole purpose of giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said. “These are not Connecticut values.”
Trump on July 4 signed the omnibus measure, which orders more than $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief, aimed chiefly at high-earning households.

But federal agencies, hampered by the ongoing budget debate on Capitol Hill, still haven’t provided states with detailed estimates of the funding they can expect to lose.
Will CT use its massive surplus to blunt the worst federal cuts?
What Connecticut and other states do know is collectively they will forfeit about $900 billion involving Medicaid and another $190 billion in nutrition assistance between now and 2034.
Connecticut officials expect federal aid here ultimately will plunge by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
The General Assembly planned two lines of defense last spring, one for the short-term and another for down the road. Both were tied to the huge state budget surpluses it’s forced annually since 2017 to reduce a hefty pension debt and replenish reserves.
State surpluses have averaged more than $1.8 billion annually, or about 8% of the General Fund, over the past eight years. 
Lawmakers began creating a long-term safety net last spring by moving  $600 million from the must-save category back into the General Fund for use in future years. Legislators and Lamont also may need to modify the spending cap before those dollars can be used, and that’s unlikely to occur before the next state budget is adopted in May.
But some reductions in federal aid are happening now, putting pressure on the state to have a safety net for the short-term as well. 
Toward that end, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly last spring created an “emergency public health safeguard account,” a one-time pot of money that could be tapped to solve problems identified this fall or winter.
Anticipating the 2024-25 fiscal year would close June 30 with a $2.5 billion surplus, lawmakers planned to return in an autumn special session and transfer some of that bounty into the emergency account.
But how much?
Both Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, have said since May their caucuses believe about $500 million should be set aside, and this week added they still anticipate some amount to be transferred in a special session next month.
In some places, the federal cuts are being felt now.
Looney said a state-sponsored children’s behavioral health program — which serves thousands of kids in and around New Haven — already is facing cutbacks from Washington.
The Hispanic Health Council of Hartford announced earlier this month that federal cuts had forced closure of a nutrition assistance program that served 15,000 people per year, CT Insider reported.
The Connecticut Project, a nonprofit policy research and advocacy group, recently invited residents to identify service cutbacks in their communities tied to federal funding. More than 2,000 emails have been collected and forwarded to the General Assembly, said spokeswoman Meghan Holden.
Though “no state can afford to backfill all of the [federal] reductions,” Ritter said, Connecticut needs a “robust fund” to blunt cuts that cause the most harm to its most vulnerable residents.
That would leave plenty from last fiscal year’s surplus, Looney and Ritter added, to reduce Connecticut’s pension debt, which exceeds $35 billion and is one of the largest, per capita, in the nation. A $2 billion payment to pensions would be the second-largest since state officials began depositing surplus into pensions in 2020.
“We have a responsibility to keep paying on our pensions … and we have a responsibility to meet the crisis moment,” Holden said.
Analysis: Federal cuts could cost 8,200 health care and related jobs
At least one analysis warned Connecticut could feel the pain of broader federal budget cuts sooner than some expect.
The Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based health foundation, projected last spring that the Medicaid cuts Congress ultimately approved would trigger the loss of 8,200 health care and related jobs in 2026 alone. This, in turn, would mean state and municipal governments here could collect about $103 million less in taxes.
The fund also projected cuts to food assistance programs would eliminate another 1,200 jobs and almost $21 million in state and municipal tax revenue.
But Congress ordered about 80% of the nutrition grant cuts that the Commonwealth Fund assumed, so the latter’s projections in this area could be inflated.
Nutrition assistance is a “critical lifeline” for about 120,000 Connecticut residents 50 or older, according to a statement this week from the state chapter of the AARP. That population relies on $212 per month in aid, on average, to cover basic food needs.
The AARP also projects it will cost Connecticut $173 million extra per year to offset federal cuts to this program and maintain current benefits.
Access to health care and nutrition are “extremely important in terms of people’s ability to work effectively and productively,” said University of Connecticut economist Fred Carstensen, who agreed that health care providers, farms and other food production industries would impose painful layoffs over the next year.
Trump and Congress ordered the cuts to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax relief over the next decade. They extended 2017 income tax cuts set to expire while adding new deductions for the elderly and for overtime wages.
But analysts are divided over how much this relief will create jobs or stimulate economic growth, since most will go toward the nation’s richest households.
The Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan research center, projected the new federal tax relief, coupled with the inflationary effect of Trump’s tariffs, would leave all but the 20% highest-earning households nationally with less.
The lowest 10% of earning households would see their financial resources drop 6.5% while the highest earning would gain about 1.5%.
“We’re talking about a major siphoning-off of discretionary spending power,” that should dangerously weaken Connecticut’s economy, said Donald Klepper-Smith, the state’s chief economic advisor in the late 2000s under Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell.
Time is running out to temper initial wave of Trump cuts
But Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to tamper with the savings programs  that his fellow Democrats want to scale back to mitigate cuts in federal assistance.
The administration was noncommittal this week when asked whether Connecticut should begin using some of last year’s surplus now to respond to federal cutbacks.
“The administration will collaborate with legislative leaders on a plan moving forward once we have clarity from Washington” on all reductions, said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
Minority Republicans in the General Assembly also have been wary of weakening savings efforts.
“We’ve got to have broader policy conversations,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, told the Connecticut Mirror earlier this summer. If lawmakers want to replace vanishing federal dollars with more state funds in one program, they should find offsetting spending reductions in others, he said.
But many Democratic lawmakers, labor unions and advocates for education, human service and municipal aid programs counter that the state is too focused on pension debt, to the detriment of its core services. And with Connecticut facing unprecedented cuts in federal aid, they say, savings efforts must be adjusted.
But Connecticut needs to decide soon how it will use the $2.5 billion left unspent from last fiscal year.
State Treasurer Erick Russell needs to inform pension analysts, who must perform periodic valuations of the program, by early November how much surplus will be deposited into retirement benefit programs.
And once surplus dollars go into Connecticut’s pension funds for state workers and municipal teachers, they cannot easily be withdrawn for other purposes.
Russell, a Democrat, said Tuesday said he believes Connecticut could use some surplus for an emergency response fund without jeopardizing the high grades it’s received from Wall Street credit rating agencies in recent years for wiping out pension debt.
But Russell did not speculate on how much surplus Connecticut could spend before Wall Street might frown, adding he would work closely both with Lamont and the legislature on any emergency response program.
“I think [an emergency fund] is consistent with us trying to position ourselves in a strong fiscal manner … and safeguarding the most vulnerable in our communities,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2277-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-24 15:57:10.606712

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers chose a consultant to conduct a study on the effects of the state’s term limits law, but some lawmakers questioned the need for the study at all.
Members of the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee heard presentations Tuesday from Garty Consulting LLC and the Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth, but during the meeting multiple lawmakers debated the need to spend up to $225,000 on a study they said would have a predictable result.
“Do we have to choose one?” asked House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks. “In six months, eight months from now, I’m not going to learn something that I don’t already know about term limits and how it impacts our legislative assembly.”
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said he didn’t support the study during the legislative session and he doesn’t support it now.
“I think there’s better uses for nearly a quarter million dollars than to study something voters just voted on and the Legislature is already responding to,” Cleary said.
North Dakota lawmakers prepare for impact of term limits

Under the term limits ballot measure approved by voters in 2022, North Dakota lawmakers can’t serve more than eight years in the state House and eight years in the state Senate. The governor is also limited to serving no more than two terms in office.
Up to 69 lawmakers will be termed out in 2028 and up to an additional 72 lawmakers will be termed out in 2030, according to a Legislative Council analysis. 
Legislative Council is looking to hire 25 new staff members for 2025-27, in part to assist new lawmakers as the term limit law begins to take effect.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, said the effects of the term limits law will compound each year. He said he believes lawmakers need to have a better idea of what to expect.
“This is just a slow moving, I’ll call it a trainwreck, that will come off the tracks, not in one single rotation of the wheels, but over a period of two to four years where we could have 50% turnover,” Hogue said. “I don’t think we’re structured now to handle that rate of turnover.”
He added lawmakers and legislative staff need an independent study on the term limits law because he believes state lawmakers are “too close” to the issue and could be accused of self-dealing. 
Some of the solutions are obvious, Hogue said. Increasing Legislative Council staff to have more long-term professionals with knowledge of the legislative branch and implementing more educational opportunities for new lawmakers could help preserve the Legislature’s co-equal branch of government status, he said.
North Dakota Legislature to boost program oversight with new hires

Lawmakers earlier this year approved up to $225,000 for the study in the budget for Legislative Council.
Committee members on Tuesday debated postponing choosing a consulting group for the study, but the motion failed.
Legislators chose Garty Consulting in a split vote after lawmakers were reassured by Legislative Council they will be able to provide guidance about the study’s focus to the consulting group as long as it doesn’t increase costs. The study is expected to cost $220,000.
In its proposal, Garty Consulting said it will survey members of the public to gauge their feelings on term limits and organize focus groups and meetings with key stakeholders to assemble data for a final report. 
The consulting firm was recently launched by Jolene Garty, former deputy executive director of operations for the South East Education Cooperative in Fargo. She said the group plans to pivot the focus of the study based on feedback from lawmakers.
The final report on the term limits study is expected by April 2026, according to the group’s proposal.

In 2021, the city of Newport served a no-trespass order to former employee Andrew Cappello. The ACLU of Vermont said it’s part of a pattern of cities barring citizens from public spaces.

A former Newport city employee who was barred from public property by the city has settled a lawsuit over the no-trespass order he received. 
Andrew Cappello worked in Newport’s Parks and Recreation Department for more than a decade before he quit his job because of his tumultuous relationship with his bosses, according to court documents. Soon after, in August 2021, he was issued a no-trespass order while at the city’s Prouty Beach Campground. 
The city’s parks director demanded Cappello leave the public property, and when Cappello refused, the lawsuit alleges, a Newport police officer arrived and issued him the order without any explanation.
In January 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont filed a lawsuit on behalf of Cappello. This week, the ACLU announced the suit had reached a settlement, dated July 11, in which Cappello received $30,000 from the city, as first reported by Newport Daily Express.
When the ACLU filed the suit, the nonprofit organization cited a pattern of Vermont cities barring citizens from public spaces and forums, including in Burlington, Montpelier and Rutland Town.  
“Forbidding someone from moving freely in a public space and participating in community life is in direct conflict with our most basic constitutional freedoms,” Hillary Rich, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Vermont, said in a press release announcing the settlement this week.

After receiving the no-trespass order, Cappello was unable to volunteer for his kids’ T-ball teams on city property and could not fulfill all the responsibilities of his new job with the NorthWoods Stewardship Center, which required him to access a city-owned beach, according to the suit. He also was given no means of challenging the order, he alleged.
As part of the settlement, Newport Mayor Rick Ufford-Chase issued a statement expressing regret for the events that led to Cappello’s no-trespass order. The settlement also stated that the city’s police department will adopt a policy that it will not issue or enforce no-trespass orders for city property. 
“I’m thrilled to be welcomed back to the City of Newport, and I’m especially pleased to learn that town officials will no longer be issuing vague trespass notices that needlessly block people from visiting parks, beaches, and other public places,” Cappello said in a statement. 
Ufford-Chase, who was elected as mayor in March 2025, was not available for comment before publication.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Parole Board on Wednesday recommended against granting clemency to death row prisoner Roy Ward, setting up a final decision by Gov. Mike Braun about two weeks before Ward’s scheduled Oct. 10 execution.
The five-member panel deliberated behind closed doors and released its recommendation letter to the governor outlining its reasoning. Board members cited the “brutal nature” of Ward’s 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, emphasizing that Payne was conscious during the attack and her “final hours living with the injuries that Roy Lee Ward inflicted on her.”
“Candidly, this Board reviews thousands of cases a year, many with gruesome facts, but the victimization of Stacy Payne stood out to us,” wrote parole board chairperson Gwen Horth.
The board’s decision is advisory. State law gives the governor sole authority to decide whether to accept the recommendation and commute Ward’s sentence, grant a reprieve or allow the execution to proceed.
Braun has yet to announce his verdict.
Unless the governor intervenes, Ward will be the third person executed since Indiana resumed capital punishment in December 2024, after more than a decade-long pause. Braun denied clemency for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, earlier this year.
Story continues below.
Roy Ward Recommendation
 
Ward declined to appear before the board. In a written affidavit, he said his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis complicates his ability to communicate, and that he wanted to “avoid any misinterpretation” of his remorse.
Instead, his defense team argued before the board on Monday that his life should be spared. Lawyers pointed to evidence that Ward “has been consistently remorseful” and asked the board to consider his autism diagnosis as a mitigating factor.
The board acknowledged the legal counsel’s argument that Ward was misdiagnosed with antisocial personality disorder during trial, and that autism spectrum disorder would have better explained his behavior. Defense counsel emphasized that those with antisocial personality disorder do not feel remorse, whereas individuals with autism can — and they recounted instances of Ward expressing remorse.
But the board wrote that it gave “little weight” to either diagnosis, concluding that the jury’s findings were supported by the facts and that the preferred autism diagnosis “still does not provide the Board with any information into why this crime occurred.”
The panel also noted that because Ward declined to appear, they were unable to question him directly, as they often do in clemency proceedings. Without that interview, members said they could not gain additional insight into what led to the crime or whether Ward’s remorse reflected genuine rehabilitation.
The state — along with members of Payne’s family and community — urged the board to deny clemency, telling the panel that Ward “deserves no mercy,” and that sparing him would deny Payne’s family the justice they’ve long awaited.
DOC obtains more pentobarbital
The clemency recommendation was handed down less than a day after newly filed court records disclosed significant details about Indiana’s execution drug stockpile. 
In pending federal litigation brought by Ward, the Indiana Attorney General’s office confirmed Tuesday that the Department of Correction has obtained “three sets” of pentobarbital.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said in a sworn declaration submitted to the Northern District judge that two of those sets will expire at the end of October — after Ward’s scheduled execution on Oct. 10 — and the third set expires in March 2026.
As of late August, Braun said the DOC didn’t yet have the necessary execution drugs, but the state would purchase more pentobarbital when necessary.
Story continues below.

The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
State officials have not responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s questions about the amount paid for the latest three doses or if any of those are expected to expire before use.
The filings by the attorney general’s office were in response to Ward’s arguments that Indiana’s current protocol creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain and suffering, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The inmate’s legal team continues to challenge the use of the drug, citing evidence that pentobarbital can cause flash pulmonary edema and sensations of drowning. 
They point to Ritchie’s execution in May, when witnesses reportedly saw the inmate “lurch upward, as if to sit up, in a spasm” after the injection, a reaction they say is “inconsistent with the normal effects of unadulterated pentobarbital.”
More execution drug details
For more than a year, the state has resisted releasing details about its lethal injection drugs.
Attorneys for Ward and other death row prisoners have argued that compounded pentobarbital degrades quickly and can lose effectiveness or become contaminated because it is mixed in small batches by compounding pharmacies rather than manufactured under conditions regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
But the state’s latest court filings stressed that DOC is using “manufactured injectable pentobarbital” — not a compounded version — to carry out executions. Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

Ward’s attorneys proposed that executions could be carried out more humanely if DOC administered a “pre-dose” of fentanyl or another opioid before pentobarbital, but Neal said in his declaration that the department “does not intend to use fentanyl as part of carrying out the death sentence” and that it is not included in the prison’s directives.
Ward also suggested firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia as alternative methods, but the state rejected those options. Currently, Indiana law only permits executions to be carried out via lethal injection.
Public records also outline how DOC previously destroyed expired doses. 
A “DEA Form 41,” used for documenting the destruction of controlled substances, revealed that pentobarbital was “burned” at the Putnamville Correctional Facility on June 6. Another record shows two doses of pentobarbital were destroyed on July 10 at the Indiana State Prison by “pour(ing)” them into “kitty litter.”
It remains unclear where the execution drugs are sourced from, however. State law still protects the identity of suppliers.
Indiana Code prohibits disclosure of “the supplier’s identity through discovery or as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding” and exempts suppliers from oversight by the pharmacy and medical licensing boards.
State law also does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.

(Callista Images via Getty Images)As the debate over vaccine mandates heats up in Florida, there’s a push in the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis to broaden the use of ivermectin.
A Republican legislator from Spring Hill has filed legislation to allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin suitable for human use even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans or animals.
Ivermectin is an effective treatment for parasites in animals and for use by humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The FDA has not approved Ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, and so far recommends against taking it for COVID-19, instead suggesting people get vaccinated for protection.  
Nevertheless, there was buzz during the pandemic about using it for treatment for COVID-19.
HB 29 sponsor Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, did not immediately return Florida Phoenix’s request for comment. If approved, Florida would join the ranks of Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Idaho, and Texas in approving the medication for over the counter sales. 
The governor, First Lady Casey DeSantis, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, and Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris held a press conference at the University of South Florida Health College of Medicine to recognize World Cancer Research Day and to highlight $60 million in new cancer research grant opportunities.  
There, the first lady said she expected some portion of the new grant funding to be used for cancer research on ivermectin.
“I know we should look at it. I know we should look at the benefits of it. We shouldn’t just speculate and guess,” DeSantis said.
Ladapo, seconded the idea.
“There’s been a lot of chatter about it, and this very simple drug that happens to be very safe, by the way, has unfortunately, you know it’s so much it’s been weighed down by all this politics, especially during the Biden administration.”
Ivermectin is not approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.

The FDA also warns large doses of ivermectin can be dangerous. “Even doses of ivermectin for approved human uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma, and even death.”

Ladapo and DeSantis defend no mandate push
Meanwhile, Ladapo and his boss DeSantis defended their push to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida law, rules, and regulations.
“I hope that we continue to reject the normal and we pursue a path that feels righteous, that feels like we’re actually, you know, aiming toward the thing that we want to  improve,” Ladapo said.
 “That opportunity is there. Thankfully, we have leadership, uniquely in this state, to do it. And I hope it spreads like, like all those minor viruses that my critics are afraid of, or something.”
The minor viruses Ladapo referred to includes measles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 1,514 confirmed measles cases this year as of Sept. 23. Six of those confirmed cases were in Florida. There were 11 confirmed measles cases in Florida in 2024.
Measles and other disease outbreaks occur as the percentage of school-age children in Florida who are vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella dips. While the target rate for MMR vaccination is 95%, Florida’s 2024-2025 rate was 88.8%. 
That’s a near 5% point change from the 2019-2020 year, a KFF analysis shows, and well below the targeted 95% needed for herd immunity.

Ladapo and DeSantis avoided directly answering whether their children have been vaccinated. Ladapo said reporters should be asking substantive questions and likened the questions about the children to “silly games.”
“I actually don’t care about sharing information about that. I really don’t care at all. But I won’t. And I won’t because I’m not going to participate in the silly games that so much of the media chooses to partake in instead of the substantive parts of the issues.”
In addition to defending his anti-vaccine mandate push, Ladapo appears on board with the Trump administration’s announcement that autism rates are up because pregnant women are taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during their pregnancies.
“They acknowledge that not all the studies show harm, but some of them do show relation. And it’s not a total explanation for autism by any means, but it does appear to be that it’s reasonable to conclude that it may be contributing to the prevalence of autism in children,” Ladapo said.
When asked whether he intended to issue any guidance he said: “We’re still looking at it. So, we may have some more guidance, but it would probably be very much in line with where the FDA is.”

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Joshuan Nolan Hicks, 44, with violating an agreement or health contract he entered into with the Iowa Physicians Health Program.
According to the board, Hicks self-reported to the program, which assists physicians with substance abuse and alcohol issues, in June 2024. Sometime in 2025, the board alleges, Hicks consumed alcohol in violation of his agreement with the program and also failed to comply with toxicology testing requirements.
A board hearing on the matter had been scheduled for Aug. 5, 2025, but on July 31, 2025, Hicks agreed to a settlement that has resulted in the indefinite suspension of his Iowa medical license.
The agreement stipulates that before Hicks’ license can be reactivated, he must submit to an evaluation and participate in the Iowa Physicians Health Program if recommended. If Hicks is deemed ineligible for participation in the program, his license will be reinstated subject to three years of probation, according to the settlement agreement.
Board records indicate Hicks was issued an Iowa medical license in April 2017 after receiving his degree from Oklahoma State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine. The records indicate he has worked as a general practice physician for the Veterans Administration’s Ottumwa clinic.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Hicks for comment.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The former secretary of Oklahoma’s top school board has demanded $100,000 from the state Department of Education, contending the agency wrongfully fired her after she complained department staff interfered with her job duties.
Amy London took the first step toward filing a lawsuit over her July 17 firing by submitting a tort claim to the agency last week with the $100,000 demand, which also alleges she suffered workplace discrimination. She contends state law gives only the Oklahoma State Board of Education, not the department, authority over hiring and firing the board secretary.
Amid ongoing tensions between state Superintendent Ryan Walters and the board, London’s claim states Walters’ chief of staff, Matt Mohler, instructed her not to communicate with board members until 24 hours before their monthly board meetings. Mohler’s directive had her withhold draft agendas and supporting documents until that deadline, leaving the board with limited time to review hundreds of pages of information needed to cast votes, London said.
“When you’ve got other personnel interfering with the board business, it prohibits a well-functioning state board office,” London told Oklahoma Voice.
The Education Department did not return a request to interview Mohler and Walters, nor did it comment on London’s claim. Instead, the agency submitted a brief statement through its spokesperson, Madison Cercy.
“We have extremely high expectations and high standards for every employee at SDE,” Cercy stated. “We have a core mission to empower parents and return education decisions back to core conservative values of our state. We expect all personnel to abide by this and sometimes things don’t work out.”

London alleged Mohler and one of his assistants hindered her, attempted to override her work, and created a “disruptive and hostile work environment,” according to a complaint she filed June 30 with the Education Department’s human resources office, which she shared with Oklahoma Voice. 
Her complaint describes Mohler as becoming more involved and commanding after London made a mistake in the board’s February meeting minutes.
The agency’s head of HR responded to the complaint in a July 10 letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained, that stated Mohler had apologized to London and that he “intended to offer help and assistance, not to overstep boundaries or cause any upset.”
The HR response also declined London’s request to change the chain of command that had the board secretary report to the agency’s general counsel. London said this was a “conflict of interest” because state law describes the secretary as an employee of the state Board of Education, not the Education Department. 
Feeling the HR process had resulted in little change, London, 61, then took her complaints to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where she reported allegations of age- and sex-based discrimination.
The Education Department fired her six days later, she said.
“They shouldn’t have dismissed me, but the bottom line is they think they can do what they want to do,” London said. “I should still have my job.”
State statute is clear that the board is in charge of its secretary’s employment, said Mike Tinney, an attorney and a state Board of Education member.
Oklahoma law directs the state board to “appoint, prescribe the duties, and fix the compensation of a secretary.” The statute also permits the board to hire an attorney and “all other personnel necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the State Board of Education.”
“Based on that statute, yes, we have the right to hire and fire (the secretary),” Tinney said.

The board voted to hire London in December to succeed longtime board secretary Terrie Cheadle, who retired that month. Before that, London worked as Walters’ office manager at the Education Department.
Board members discovered London was no longer employed as their secretary when they arrived for their monthly meeting on July 24, a week after she was fired. They complained Walters might have exceeded his authority by removing her.
One member, Chris Van Denhende, called for a special board meeting to discuss London’s dismissal and Walters’ powers as the board’s chair.
“I think we need to discuss the appropriate roles of the board compared to the president of the board,” Van Denhende said during the July 24 meeting.
Van Denhende did not comment for this story. Fellow board members Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage did not return requests for comment.
In the past, the entire board voted in unison with Walters, and its members received agenda information up to 14 days in advance of each meeting, London said.
But, the relationship between Walters and the board changed dramatically in February when Gov. Kevin Stitt replaced three of his board appointees while complaining they and the state superintendent were the source of “needless political drama.”
Stitt’s newly appointed board members — Tinney, Van Denhende, Carson and Deatherage — have been willing to challenge and publicly disagree with Walters, unlike their predecessors.

Internally, Walters’ administration viewed the new board members like “the enemy,” London said. After they were appointed, London received the directive not to communicate with the board until 24 hours before each monthly meeting, she said.
Being caught in the middle of the conflict was uncomfortable, London said, but she believed she could bridge the gap between both sides.
“Do I agree with some of the things the superintendent does, his conservative values and beliefs? Yes, I do,” she said. “But at the same time, he was elected; I was appointed. We have a job to do for the people of Oklahoma, for the next generation of Oklahomans.”
Meanwhile, the newly appointed board members have pleaded with Walters to provide board meeting information further in advance — most notably after they had less than 24 hours to read hundreds of pages describing new academic standards for social studies. 
One board member, Ryan Deatherage, even voted against the new standards in the board’s February meeting, saying he hadn’t had enough time to properly read them. 
Board members would later learn the social studies standards included significant last-minute changes from the original draft, including the addition of language casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Half of the board said they weren’t aware of the added content and made unsuccessful calls for another chance to vote on the standards. 
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has since blocked the new standards from being taught in schools while a lawsuit is pending over their constitutionality.
Tinney said he and other board members have been wondering why Walters’ administration couldn’t provide information on coming agenda items sooner. He said he was unaware London had been directed to limit the board’s preparation time to 24 hours before each meeting.
“I’m not surprised because that’s when we got it,” Tinney said. “If you attended the meetings, we were always pushing to get it earlier, so we’d have time to review it.”
The state board voted Sept. 3 to start the process of accepting applications for its next board secretary.
London said she has been unemployed since the Education Department fired her. The $100,000 demand would cover both lost wages and damages suffered as a result of the wrongful termination, her claim contends.
She said she would consider accepting her job back if the board secretary’s office moved out of the Education Department building. Working for the agency’s chief of staff was “toxic,” she said, and Walters never responded when she sent him a message with her complaints.
London said she felt betrayed after having grown close with Walters and his family.
“I made birthday cakes for Ryan Walters’ children. I’ve been to his house to celebrate. His wife invited me over for Christmas. I mean, I would visit with his mom,” London said. “Ryan is in between my two sons in age. His wife celebrated my birthday with me in ’24. So it was like, OK, the fact that he could not even respond or have a one-on-one conversation, I think it speaks volumes.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-24 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Health care professionals train in mental health support for moms,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/24/health-care-pros-train-in-mental-health-for-moms/,Mississippi health care professionals received training about the profound changes women experience during early motherhood.,"FLOWOOD – Questions of profound transformation during early motherhood – including changes in mind, body and sense of self – were the subject of discussions by more than 100 Mississippi health care professionals working to better serve the women they see every day. 
The internationally established perinatal mental health training this week was free to participants because of a grant from the federal government and the collaboration of two Mississippi health groups.
The three-day course ran through Wednesday at Table 100 restaurant in the Jackson suburb of Flowood. On Monday and Tuesday, participants learned from Postpartum Support International educators how to spot important warning signs, understand lifesaving distinctions and get women and their partners connected to help they need during a time of significant and often misunderstood physical, emotional and identity shifts.
Enrollees included physicians, midwives, doulas, nurses, therapists, lactation consultants, social workers and pharmacists. Many said they have long been interested in learning how to better help the mothers they work with, but the cost of such a course would usually be prohibitive.
“It’s a very professional, well-respected program, so I’ve had it on my wish list and I’d already kind of started to budget it out and was planning on maybe eventually going to it in New Orleans. But then when I heard about this, I jumped on it,” said Bianca Wooden, a lactation consultant in Ocean Springs.

Scholarships were made possible because leaders from Mississippi Public Health Institute, a nonprofit that promotes wellbeing, and Champ4Moms, a referral service at the University of Mississippi Medical Center for providers who treat mothers, allocated funding from federal grants. Both groups’ grants came from the Health Resources and Services Administration. 
Between 2019 and 2023, Mississippi had the highest rate of pregnancy-related death. The leading causes include mental health. 
About 1 in 5 women suffers from postpartum depression – a number that is likely closer to 1 in 3 due to underreporting, said Paige Bellenbaum, a Postpartum Support International trainer based in New York.
And it’s not just postpartum depression. Perinatal mental health encompasses many conditions that arise during pregnancy all the way up through 12 months postpartum. If untreated, conditions can last well beyond that. Anxiety can be just as common as depression and can be crippling for new moms.
There’s also panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, not to mention preexisting conditions such as bipolar or post-traumatic stress disorder that become exacerbated or changed by the demands of motherhood. 
Globally, about 1 in 3 women experiences some form of physical or sexual abuse, and PTSD from those experiences is often triggered by pregnancy and birth.

“I assume everyone has a history of trauma until proven otherwise,” said Birdie Gunyon Meyer, a registered nurse with a master’s degree in psychology and counseling who serves as the director of education and training at Postpartum Support International. 
Panelists stressed the importance of having a diversity of providers trained in perinatal mental health, since new mothers see their obstetricians alarmingly infrequently for just a few minutes at a time.
It’s often unclear to doctors whether evaluating mothers for mental health conditions falls on them, speakers said. Having many professionals who encounter women throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period trained in perinatal mental health helps eliminate those misses.  
The providers who are seen as less clinical may even have better luck getting patients to open up. And while they can’t diagnose or give medical advice, they can refer those patients to professionals who can.
“I think the reframe for our ally professionals is you might be able to get that ‘in’ before I do as a therapist,” said Patience Riley, a Georgia-based licensed professional counselor and trainer for Postpartum Support International. “People are going to tell you their stories before they tell me their stories. They feel more relaxed, they feel more comfortable, so use that to your advantage to then offer the referral to the therapist, to the prescriber, to the clinic.”
Attendees learned how not to make assumptions around pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, such as: getting pregnant is easy or difficult, being pregnant means being in a loving relationship, a C-section is easy, strong women don’t need medication, being a mother is instinctual or breastfeeding will come naturally.
They also learned important distinctions such as the difference between the intrusive thoughts of harming one’s baby that are due to OCD and are very unlikely to occur, versus those due to psychosis which are more likely to occur.  
Activities involved asking participants to recall a time they met someone who was using substances during pregnancy or motherhood to examine their biases and reflect on how to suspend judgment, as well as learning how to perform intake assessments and earn patients’ trust.
Providers who completed the training are eligible to take an exam at a Pearson testing center to gain internationally accredited certification through Postpartum Support International.

That certification helps assure parents that the provider has legitimate training, but trained providers who choose not to take the test will still help fill in gaps in care, the educators said. 
“Motherhood today can be such a lonely and isolating experience just based on the composition of families and geography,” Bellenbaum said. “A long time ago we had cousins and aunties and grandmothers and moms around, to not only support baby but to support mom. And we just don’t have that community for a lot of families anymore.”
For moms, having a support group or working with a doula, an acupuncturist or another health care provider “can be a part of this fabric to help you through that transition,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23115653/3X0A9767.jpg,,,2025-09-24 15:57:10.606712

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The University of Minnesota will no longer lease its Rosemount gun range to outside groups, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has had a contract with the university to lease the range since 2022.
The range, which has operated for over 40 years, will continue to be used by University of Minnesota public safety officers, according to a statement from the U. The webpage for renting the university’s firearms range was active at the beginning of August, but has since been taken down.
A Reformer analysis in April found four contracts between the university and ICE, the most recent amounting to $18,867, for the federal agency to use the firearm range for training. Around a third of the most recent year-long contract amount — $6,200 — was used by the time the contract ended in May. According to public spending data, it was ICE’s only existing contract with a university at the time.
The Reformer report spurred months of advocacy from university students and Rosemount residents, according to the university’s chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. Isaac Stets, a sophomore at the U and a member of SDS, said the campaign to end the gun range lease overlapped with existing efforts by several student organizations to protect noncitizen community members from ICE.
The efforts are a response to the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement by, at times, masked agents repeatedly accused of violating due process rights.
In March, ICE agents detained Turkish student Doğukan Günaydın. Though Günaydın has since been released, Stets said there remains a “lingering fear for most of the international and immigrant students at the university” from the incident.
Rosemount residents also emailed university president Rebecca Cunningham to denounce the contract, said Jake Ameca Luna, a Rosemount resident and political operative, who said he sought to raise awareness in Rosemount.
The university’s statement made no mention of community advocacy or ICE in the decision to stop leasing the gun range to outside groups.
Instead, the “operational decision” was made after “careful consideration of investments in staffing and maintenance as well as potential liability risks,” said Erik Swanson, U of M interim police chief, in the written statement.
Those involved in the campaign against the gun range rental, including Stets, said they are skeptical.
“It seems very convenient that, this spring, there are mass uprisings about cooperation with ICE, and one of their grad students gets [detained] and held illegitimately and students are pissed about it, that they suddenly run into maintenance problems or issues with liability,” Stets said.
Stets pointed out the difference in tone between Swanson’s statement and the university’s 2020 statement limiting its relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department — temporarily, it turned out. Former university president Joan Gabel’s statement at the time made explicit reference to the police killing of George Floyd. In the case of the university’s contract with ICE, “they’re kind of just shoving it in the corner,” Stets said.
The gun range rental and the university’s response to student activism is just one part of a “pattern of cooperation between university administration and these kinds of federal repressive policies that are being put in place,” Stets said.
U students have raised other concerns about UMore Park, the 3,975-acre parcel of land in Rosemount that’s home to the gun range. For instance, this summer, students protested — once through vandalization of homes — the sale of UMore land for a new aerospace center, the Star Tribune reported.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 14:58:19.433319

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley) WURTLAND  — Though he may not agree with late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel on much, Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul reiterated that the government should not be involved with taking him off the air. 
The Kentucky senator was one of a few conservatives Kimmel thanked in his monologue that aired Tuesday night as he returned to his show on ABC after the network suspended him for comments he made about the death of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. 
“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said. 
Kimmel also thanked another Kentucky Republican , U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Talking with reporters after a forum in Greenup County Wednesday morning, Paul said with a chuckle that it was “the first time I’ve ever been on his program.” 
“I’m sure he and I probably don’t have a lot of agreements, but I don’t think the government should be involved, and I stick with that,” Paul said. “The government should not have anything to do with the content of a comedian’s monologue.”
Paul also said that if ABC felt like Kimmel had said something inappropriate, then it should have the ability to fire him. 
“There are reasons why you can be fired. You have a right to speech, but you don’t have a right to employment,” Paul said. “So, it becomes complicated, but I think it’s important that people know you can still have a strong opinion. I knew Charlie Kirk very well, and I have a very strong opinion of anybody who thinks to make light of that.”
Paul had blasted  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brandon Carr’s criticism of Kimmel as “absolutely inappropriate” in a Sunday interview on NBC’s Meet the Press.
“The FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any — any — attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight,” Paul said at the time. 
Paul is traveling throughout Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District with Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie Wednesday and Thursday for a mix of political and campaign events. 
After Paul commented on Kimmel’s mention, Massie added that he did appreciate one of Kimmel’s jokes from last night.
“He said that the result of this is everybody was forced to watch Jimmy Kimmel’s show, and that to take attention off of this, the administration might have to release the Epstein files,” the congressman said. 
Earlier Wednesday morning, Massie said that following the results of a special election in Arizona, he now has the 218 signatures to force a U.S. House vote to release the federal investigation files related to convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5213-e1758739734323-1024x748.jpg,,,2025-09-24 14:58:19.433319

Sept. 24, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance A cadre of unions representing a wide swath of workers across Michigan on Wednesday demanded that the Legislature, at long last, agree to a budget deal before the current fiscal year ends next week.
Michigan is careening toward a government shutdown because the House and Senate have yet to come to terms on how to fund the state in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
All manner of services, parks, inspections and other vital government functions will cease if the state shuts down due to the budget impasse. Schools are without state funding resources as they enter October, and it’s quite possible that the state might not be able to provide them with their first payments expected later that month.

Even worse, a prolonged shutdown could affect the state’s credit rating and have other unintended financial consequences. Still, the House and Senate have not been able to break the gridlock of divided government despite Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer trying mightily to bring the two sides together.
With those consequences in mind, members of the Michigan AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers, SEIU Michigan, AFSCME, the UAW and the Michigan Education Association all linked arms, so to speak, during two separate rallies held outside Lansing City Hall – adjacent from the Michigan Capitol – to urge the chambers along.
Terrence Martin, president of AFT Michigan, said the moment has reached critical mass.
“We are a week away from ensuring our students’ future,” Martin said. “We cannot allow legislators to drop the ball in this moment. It is critical. It is crucial.”
Eric Rader, AFT’s vice president focused on higher education issues, warned against lawmakers continuing to raid the school aid fund – which primarily funds K-12 public schools – in order to fund higher education. With massive cuts coming at the federal level as fallout from President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending plan, the legislature needs to focus on making college affordable and not have it compete for state dollars dedicated to K-12 schools.
“That’s not fair to K-12,” Rader said. “It’s certainly not fair to higher education.”
Jennifer Hollander, an educator in western Oakland County’s Huron Valley Schools, said the state needs to pass an equitable education budget that fully funds local schools and the programs that children rely on to succeed, like literacy coaches and universal meals.

Ron Bieber, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO, said that no matter how crazy things have gotten in Washington, D.C., he has not seen dysfunction on the level the state Legislature has stooped to in the current budget cycle. Bieber said a worker-first budget would fully fund the state’s occupational hazard and safety agency, career technical programs for skilled trades, protections for prevailing wages and universal free school meals.
“Instead of these practical common sense investments, Michigan House Republicans have been inspired by Trump and his billionaire buddies who are trying to slash and burn our government,” Bieber said. “Republicans in Michigan think if they break our budget and cripple critical services, people will lose faith in the government’s ability to serve the people, allowing them to make even deeper cuts next time it’s a never ending cycle. It’s got to stop.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The Florida governor’s office is vowing continued vigilance at the state’s detention centers hours after a now-deceased shooter killed two detainees and injured another at a Dallas ICE facility Wednesday morning.
“Florida will continue to be vigilant in ensuring safety and security at our detention facilities,” Molly Best, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary, told the Florida Phoenix in a statement.
“Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” are Florida’s two main migrant detention centers working in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They were mostly constructed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management at the direction of top leaders, and together can hold over 5,000 people. Specific security details at the facilities were not provided by the state due to cited security risks.
FDEM did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, a gunman attacked an ICE Dallas field office Wednesday morning, firing “indiscriminately” at both the building and a van near the entrance. This is where three detainees were shot, killing two and putting the third in critical condition.
The gunman then committed suicide, DHS continued.
“We can confirm, the shell casings were found with anti-ICE messages on them. This was an attack on ICE law enforcement,” the statement posted on social media says. “This horrific attack occurred amidst the 1000% increase in assaults against @ICEgov.
“Politicians and media pundits must stop the vile lies and smears designed to demonize and dehumanize ICE law enforcement. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences,” the agency added.
The Dallas attack came a month after an individual was arrested for threatening Dallas ICE officers with an alleged “detonator” on his wrist.
“Alligator Alcatraz,” located deep within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was the nation’s first major ICE facility constructed after Donald Trump assumed the presidency. Trump joined DeSantis and other top federal and state officials on July 1 to celebrate the center’s opening.
Since then, Florida has opened “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and has floated the “Panhandle Pokey” in northwest Florida. Florida also has four other, smaller, state-run centers.

Josh Stein's administration overseeing Hurricane Helene recovery testify in front of state lawmakers on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)As Gov. Josh Stein’s top lieutenants for Hurricane Helene recovery sat before North Carolina lawmakers on Wednesday, they recited a familiar line: federal aid money was arriving far slower than the state was able to work.
Days before the storm’s one-year anniversary, the officials told the General Assembly that applications submitted for a major grant program had been pending before FEMA for months. And although the state stood up its homebuilding program in record time, federal regulations and processes meant that the first full reconstructed home likely would not be complete until January.
Those projections led lawmakers from both parties toward the same line of questioning: is there any way to make all of this go faster?
“Should we really, in the state, be in the housing business?” asked Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus). Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) wondered if “maybe the state will be better off being more invested in some of the state-funded solutions.” And Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) asked whether the state could effectively pre-empt reimbursement from the feds on a key grant program: “Is that the way it works? Or do they actually look at every (application)?”
“All we need from FEMA is their checkbook,” Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) said.
The slow trickle of aid is familiar for major disaster recovery, a years-long process that takes billions of dollars. But the Trump administration’s operation of FEMA — requiring top-level sign-off on all spending and enforcing new layers of scrutiny on all aid — has slowed the flow of money even more to western North Carolina and frustrated state officials and lawmakers alike. North Carolina has received federal funds to cover 9% of total damages; Stein has requested funding to cover 48%.
Trump, as well as some Republican members of Congress, have on multiple occasions expressed a desire to move the bulk of disaster response operations and funding down to the state level. But for now, that responsibility remains with FEMA.
Money for Helene does continue to flow piecemeal. FEMA greenlit an additional $48 million for North Carolina on Monday, and $64.2 million the week prior. But Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s western recovery office, said Wednesday that the state’s applications under a specific rebuilding grant program had been waiting for action by FEMA since February.
“That’s a good exemplar for the kinds of dynamics we’re running into right now,” Calabria said.
That chunk of money, called the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, is designed to fund projects to prevent future disasters: relocating developments on floodplains, installing levees and floodwalls and retrofitting older buildings. North Carolina could be eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion under the program, officials said Wednesday. Both local governments and property owners can apply for grants. But “no homes have been approved” for the program as of Wednesday, Calabria said.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of North Carolina’s hazard mitigation grant applications.
Jonathan Krebs, Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, told lawmakers the state couldn’t go ahead with projects under the program and hope for reimbursement from FEMA later. The most likely result from that, he said, would be rejection — though he admitted that would be better than the current limbo.

“We would love for them to say no, because then we could move onto other solutions,” Krebs said. “Right now, they’re saying nothing.”
Meanwhile, the state continues to trudge toward rebuilding homes under Renew NC, the state’s homebuilding operation that will use around $800 million in federal dollars.
State officials have kick-started casework on applicants despite still waiting on that federal money, using $120 million provided by state lawmakers. Renew NC has completed repairs on one home, and four others are now in the “pre-construction” phase, according to a state dashboard.
Work on the first home to need full reconstruction is expected to start “fairly soon,” said Stephanie McGarrah, who leads the Department of Commerce division overseeing the program. She estimated that construction could be complete around January.
Jones, the House majority leader, had heard testimony earlier from Samaritan’s Purse — a Christian aid organization that has been rebuilding homes in western North Carolina separately from government programs. The group is currently building 30 mobile homes and 40 fully furnished homes in the region, vice president Luther Harrison said Wednesday. Jones wondered whether the state was better off leaning on groups like Harrison’s for a larger chunk of work.
North Carolina has received more than 3,000 applications to its Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program to help low- to moderate-income families who experienced significant storm damage.
“Do you think it would be wise for this body to start funding the outside groups … that can move way faster than state government?” Jones asked.
Those organizations fill valuable gaps on construction that “the federal government cannot fund,” Krebs responded. But many of the properties handled by non-government groups are often lower-cost ones; for more expensive projects, its a harder sell, he said.
“When that average value starts getting really high, I think that’s where state and federal solutions start having to step in,” Krebs said, referencing major bridges specifically.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1875-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 14:58:19.433319

The announcement marks the fifth special election for state legislative seats in 2025. While Republicans came out of the 2024 election season with supermajorities in both chambers, Democrats were able to break the supermajority in the Iowa Senate with two special election victories — Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, won a January special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer as she joined Reynolds administration, and Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City, won in an August special election following the death of Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton.
House Republicans still have a 66-33 supermajority after Sexton’s resignation.
The winner of the Iowa House District 7 special election will hold the position for the remainder of Sexton’s term — until January 2027.

“Access to courts, including the right to appeal, is a fundamental right for the purposes of equal rights and opportunity under the law,” Circuit Judge Daniel Green wrote.
This law, he said, “impinges” on that right because it only grants authority to appeal a preliminary injunction in which a state or state official is involved, and then only to the attorney general. 
“There is no compelling governmental interest achieved in allowing only the attorney general to appeal a preliminary injunction where a court has found that a challenged state law is flawed and granted injunctive relief,” Green wrote.
Officials with Missouri Attorney General Catharine Hanaway’s office in a statement Wednesday said they “strongly disagree” with Green’s decision.
“We will move to appeal that aspect of the judgment to safeguard the General Assembly’s legislative intent and protect the rights of Missourians,” the statement read.
Green ruled in a case filed in April by attorney Chuck Hatfield on behalf of longtime progressive activist Sean Nicholson. They argued that several provisions of the law run afoul of the state constitution, including provisions revising how ballot title challenges are handled by the courts. 
But in his ruling, Green upheld most of the bill as constitutional. 
Under the law, any ballot title deemed insufficient or unfair is sent back to the secretary of state up to three times for revision. If, after three attempts, the courts still find the language unacceptable, a judge is then allowed to write the language. 
The new ballot title challenge procedure is being used for the first time in a separate case in Green’s court.
On Friday, Green ruled that the ballot title for a measure passed by lawmakers, which failed to plainly state that the amendment would ban abortion, was “insufficient and unfair” and must be rewritten. 
That amendment seeks to again ban abortion in Missouri, with limited exceptions for survivors of rape and incest and for medical emergencies. The ballot title, as prepared by lawmakers, does not mention that it would make most abortions illegal.
Green gave Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins until Friday to draft new language. 
The new law also increased the length of summary statements for ballot measures proposed by the Missouri General Assembly, to 100 words rather than 50. The law also moves up the deadline for completing all court challenges to 10 weeks before the election – two fewer weeks than what was previously allowed 
Hatfield on Wednesday morning maintained that the rest of the bill was “procedurally improper” and said he plans to appeal Green’s decision to uphold the rest of the law as constitutional. 
“It’s an important issue because it changes the way we do ballot title re-writes,” Hatfield said.  “And there are several cases right now in Cole County that involve possible ballot title re-writes.” 
Missouri First Lady Claudia Kehoe tapped as treasurer for 2026 abortion ban campaign

Ongoing legal battles over access to abortion in Missouri were the impetus for the new law.
Ahead of the 2024 General Election, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft for the abortion rights amendment was “problematic” and rewrote the language himself.
In November, Missouri became the first state to overturn an abortion ban after voters narrowly approved an amendment guaranteeing the constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
But a series of laws regulating abortion providers prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the election. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state over these regulations, and in the coming months a Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law. 
In issuing two preliminary injunctions, Zhang blocked state laws that requiring a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, requiring physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and requiring a licensing requirement for abortion clinics. 
This judge used a preliminary injunction to temporarily strike down these abortion provider regulations, opening up access to in-clinic abortions in Missouri beginning in February.
In April, the Republican supermajority in the legislature passed the new law giving the attorney general the power to appeal the preliminary injunction. Then-attorney general Andrew Bailey immediately put the new law to use by appealing the abortion preliminary injunction. 
That case was heard in mid-September in the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals in Kansas City.

In oral arguments in the Missouri Supreme Court Wednesday morning, Lambda Legal attorney Nora Huppert said the November judgment “relies on evidence that was expressly excluded for its truth, and it draws conclusions from testimony that are the opposite of what that testimony says.” 
For that reason, and others, Huppert argues the decision should be reversed.
But the Missouri Attorney General’s office, represented Wednesday by Solicitor General Lou Capozzi, rejects the notion that the law is discriminatory in nature.
“Appellants have no evidence for their allegation that this could be only motivated by animus when the state presented a mountain of evidence that it is concerned about the health and safety of children,” he told the judges.
The law, passed in 2023, bars health care providers from prescribing or administering cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs, or performing gender-transition surgeries, for anyone under 18. Provisions barring gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers are set to expire on Aug. 28, 2027, though lawmakers have shown intentions to remove the sunset.
In his November ruling, Wright County Circuit Court Judge Craig Carter determined that the restrictions weren’t discriminatory and could only be subject to rational basis review. This is the most lenient standard, requiring challengers to prove that there is no basis that the law can stand.
The legal standard for reviewing the law is a key part of the case. Statutes that violate Missouri’s equal protection clause, which says everyone is entitled to “equal rights and opportunity,” are subject to heightened scrutiny.
Attorneys from Lambda Legal, a civil rights law firm focused on LGBTQ+ litigation, and the ACLU of Missouri argue heightened scrutiny should be applied because the law “classifies based on sex and transgender status.”
Evidence — and the quality of it — is also a point of contention.
Huppert said Carter’s judgment “adopted largely verbatim” the state’s proposed findings of fact, which was filed at the conclusion of trial and before the court’s transcript was complete. The filings confirm Carter’s findings of fact outright mirror the state’s, adopting the same subheadings and copying paragraphs verbatim.
This makes the judgment deeply flawed, appellants’ brief argues, because these findings misconstrued testimony from the trial and refer to exhibits that were not allowed into the court record.
During the two-week trial last year, the attorney general’s office employed a tactic of questioning witnesses using articles and studies not accepted into the court record.
Capozzi pointed to a section of the judgment which expanded on testimony from medical ethicist Dr. Farr Curlin as proof the two documents were not 100% identical.
“The trial court was not just copying and pasting,” he said. “And the implication that the trial court was lazy or didn’t do its job is not proper.”
Judge Craig Carter, a Wright County judge serving in Cole County for Missouri’s gender-affirming care trial, listens to a nurse practitioner testify during the September 2024 trial (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Carter’s judgment acknowledges the overwhelming amount of evidence presented during the extensive trial, describing “binders of evidentiary documents that were piled so high on the bench that (his) was at times obscured.”
“This was a very lengthy and complex case,” he wrote. “It would be impossible for the court to make factual findings for each witness. The court reporter’s transcript in this case is several thousand pages.”
A clear look at the evidence, Huppert argued, would show the law is unconstitutional no matter what level of scrutiny is applied.
“The record reflects that the care ban for minors actually harms minors rather than protects them, and for that reason, the law is wholly irrational as well,” she told the judges.
Interpreting the evidence in this case is not straightforward. From the beginning, the law’s challengers and the state have not agreed on the factual background of the case and those disagreements continued Wednesday.
For example, Capozzi opened his argument by describing the law as “bipartisan,” misconstruing a compromise that led Senate Democrats to end a filibuster. But no Democrats in either the House or Senate voted in favor of the legislation.
The state’s argument also rejects claims that gender-affirming hormone therapy and puberty blockers treat gender dysphoria, a condition describing distress that occurs when someone’s sex as assigned at birth misaligns with their gender identity.
In the trial, experts largely spoke about the effectiveness of treatments as it relates to adolescents. But part of the challenged law bans the state’s Medicaid program from covering gender-affirming care for minors and adults.
Carter upheld the Medicaid restrictions, saying challengers “failed to develop any argument specifically tailored to challenging the Medicaid provision.”
Huppert said that argument was “throughout” filings. Appellants included Medicaid ban as part of “the act” in filings, challengers’ brief said, but the state claims the argument wasn’t explicit.
Judges had almost no questions during the arguments Wednesday, apart from a question from Judge Ginger Gooch asking how the case differs from a challenge of Arkansas’ gender-affirming-care ban. A federal appeals court upheld Arkansas’ ban in August.
The states’ statutes have some differences, Huppert said, and Missouri’s equal protection clause is more extensive than the federal protections relied upon in that case.
Capozzi said the statutes are “almost identical,” also pointing to similarities in Tennessee’s gender-affirming-care restrictions which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in June.

She not only touched the lives of hundreds of families, supporting them in the care of their loved ones; she also mentored and inspired a generation of Hospice nurses, physical therapists, home health aides, and volunteers.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Betsy Gardner.","Born March 6, 1939
Newark, New Jersey
Died Sept. 20, 2025
Colchester, Vermont

Grace Elizabeth “Betsy” Patten Gardner, who made a long career helping people die well, passed away on September 20 at the McClure Miller Respite House in Colchester. She leaves three children, eight grandchildren, a brother, sisters-in-law, nephews, nieces, and many dear friends.
Born in New Jersey in 1939, her family moved to Cuttingsville when she was still an infant, and except for short periods in Connecticut and Virginia, she remained in Vermont for the rest of her life. She deeply loved Shrewsbury, where her parents, Arthur and Peggy Patten, were prominent members of the community. She and her siblings John, Judy, Joe, and Will went first to a one-room schoolhouse and then Rutland High School, where she graduated in 1957.
At age three, while in Connecticut, she contracted Polio. She lost the strength in her right leg and gained an intimate knowledge of children’s hospitals. Wearing her brace, and later using canes and a chair, she spent her life striving to not just keep up with her peers, but to surpass them.
She graduated from UVM nursing school in 1961 and went to work in various wards at the DeGoesbriand, including the Psych ward, where she became very good at Ping-Pong. She joined the Visiting Nurse Association in 1976. In 1991 she began working in the Hospice program—her favorite nursing experience—and helped in the early days of Respite House in Williston. She not only touched the lives of hundreds of families, supporting them in the care of their loved ones; she also mentored and inspired a generation of Hospice nurses, physical therapists, home health aides, and volunteers. In 1996 Dr. Jim Madison requested Betsy to be his hospice nurse, and her care and integrity inspired him, Dr. Joan Madison, and her friend Estelle Deane to create the Madison-Deane Initiative to promote hospice care and support the training of hospice nurses. In 2017 a scholarship through Madison-Deane was named in her honor.
Betsy married William Lawrence Gardner in 1962 and together they raised three children: Kate McDaniel (John), Geoff Gardner (Wendy), and Alex Gardner (Rosario) in St. George.
In 2000 her mother Peggy and her ex-husband Larry both died, and feeling the need for a break, she retired and moved to Virginia to be near her daughter and three grandchildren. But she missed Vermont too much, so she returned in 2003 and settled at the Pines on Dorset Street. She immediately became active in the community, joining the Friends of the South Burlington Library, organizing talks through EEE, writing a community newsletter, and bringing in speakers to educate her neighbors on what she enjoyed calling pre-death preparations.
She traveled the country with her elder sister Judy; visited her son Alex in Italy, China, and Tibet; traveled in England with Alex and his family, and again with her nephew Jamie and his wife Marcia. With Judy she went deep into her Brewster and Patten family archives, typing out letters from the early nineteenth century and cataloging multiple boxes of documents that will be donated to the Connecticut State Historical Society. She published a book detailing her parents’ marriage based on the weekly letters they both wrote to their families.
When she received a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer in her left pleura in December 2024, she decided to limit treatment to comfort and pain management and accepted her position on the receiving end of Hospice care. Her family and friends helped her remain independent until the end. Special thanks to Jamie and Marcia, her niece Jessie, and brother Will for visiting and running errands when her children were not in town.
She and the family are grateful for the warmth and kindness of her neighbors at the Pines, particularly Diane Coil and Jackie Mastrianni; for the kindness and attention of her nurse Hailey Duquette and the rest of the Hospice team; and to Dara Stimpson, who aided her enormously in bringing her life to a close. She died as she lived, with exceptional organization and grace, surrounded by the love of her family and friends.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.A 28-year-old woman was charged with wire fraud Wednesday for what federal prosecutors allege is her role in a $14 million scheme to defraud Minnesota’s Medicaid autism treatment program — the first person charged as part of what is believed to be a wide-ranging investigation.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota charged Asha Farhan Hassan for what they say is her role in the theft from the state’s Early Intensive Developmental Behavioral Intervention services program, which is supposed to assist people under 21 with autism spectrum disorder. The Reformer first reported the autism Medicaid fraud investigation last year.
Prosecutors also said Hassan used her business to defraud the Federal Child Nutrition Program that was at the center of the massive pandemic-era food aid scandal known as Feeding Our Future, according to court documents.
The Reformer left a message with Hassan’s attorney, Ryan Pacyga, who didn’t immediately respond.
In 2019, Hassan began Smart Therapy with several partners to purportedly provide one-on-one therapy to children with autism. To be reimbursed by the state, Smart Therapy needed to enroll children with autism, and Hassan and her partners approached parents in the Somali community to recruit and enroll children, according to court documents. Some of the children were not diagnosed with autism.
Hassan and Smart Therapy paid monthly kickbacks ranging from $300 to $1,500 each month to the parents who enrolled their children with Smart Therapy, according to court documents.
Smart Therapy quickly became one of the state’s biggest autism treatment providers.
Smart Therapy also employed 18- or 19-year-old relatives with no experience related to the treatment of autism and had no formal education beyond high school, according to court documents.
Smart Therapy obtained over $14 million from 2019 to 2024 from Medicaid through the Minnesota Department of Human Services and U Care, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
The Reformer reported in 2024 that a former supervisor at Smart Therapy made repeated attempts to report what she said were negligence and fraud to state officials.
Growth of spending on the Minnesota autism program has exploded in recent years. The number of providers — who are supposed to diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder — has increased 700% in five years, climbing from 41 providers in 2018 to 328 in 2023.
While allegedly defrauding the autism program, Hassan also used Smart Therapy to submit fraudulent claims to Feeding Our Future, according to court documents. Between 2020 and 2021, Hassan claimed to serve nearly 200,000 meals to children in Smart Therapy, for which she received about $465,000, the documents said.
Hassan shared the fraudulent dollars with her partners, sent hundreds of thousands abroad and used some of the money to purchase real estate in Kenya, according to court documents.
Wednesday’s charge is another instance of the alleged defrauding of a Minnesota public program.
“Today’s charges mark the first in the ongoing investigation into fraud in the EIDBI Autism Program,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson.  “To be clear, this is not an isolated scheme. From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money.  Each case we bring exposes another strand of this network.”
Hassan is at least the 76th person charged in the Feeding Our Future investigation.

Derrick Van Orden’s proposed bill intended to cut off federal funds from any entity that employs individuals “who condone and celebrate political violence and domestic terrorism”.
In Eau Claire, Van Orden has threatened federal funds to the city because of statements made by two city council members in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk. He also recently threatened to defund the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire for similar reasons. 
Many of the protesters at the event wore hazmat suits because, they said, Van Orden is “toxic” to Wisconsin. The group marched on Farwell St. and chanted their protests against Van Orden’s attempts to limit free speech.
After an introduction from organizer Cindy Greening, former Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs spoke at a brief press conference at the event. “The thought that a United States congressman would threaten an entire community because he doesn’t happen to like what a couple of folks said or allegedly said, is beyond outrageous,” Wachs said. “This person must not be in Congress.”
Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge also addressed the crowd. “We are here because our community has come under attack, not from the outside, but from our own congressman,” Berge said. “In a series of statements and proposed legislation, Rep. Van Orden has threatened to strip millions of dollars in federal funding from our city, punishing 80,000 people for the words of two individuals. Let’s be clear, this is not just political theater. This is a direct attack on free speech, the cornerstone of our democracy, the First Amendment.”
The protesting and marching continued after the press conference, garnering many honks and waves from people driving by on Farwell.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Republicans in the New Mexico Senate announced this week that they’re convening a legislative task force to tackle the state’s health care challenges, saying their Democratic colleagues have “refused to take action,” according to a Tuesday news release.
The task force will meet on Sept. 29 in the Sandoval County Commission chambers in Rio Rancho. According to an agenda, the three-hour meeting will address medical malpractice reform and elicit testimony from local hospital leaders, government reform groups and patients. New Mexico Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie will also speak.
The meeting “is a direct response to ongoing public interest and concern regarding New Mexico’s deteriorating access to quality healthcare,” according to a news release from the Senate GOP. “Furthermore, this hearing was organized in large part due to the fact that despite official requests from Republican legislators, Democrats in the legislature have refused to take action or host meaningful discussions on this topic during the interim legislative committee process.”
The hearing will occur two days before a special legislative session focused on anticipated federal cuts to Medicaid, among other topics. Republicans previously called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, to include medical malpractice reform on the Oct. 1 session agenda, though she has not done so. They subsequently pushed back at the limited scope of the special session and requested additional topics, including interstate medical compacts, which would allow health care workers licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico.

Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan policy organization, found in a report published last year that New Mexico has one medical malpractice lawsuit for every 14,000 New Mexicans, more than twice the national average. Also, a spate of high-dollar judgements has raised costs of medical malpractice insurance, sometimes by as much as 500%. The organization also has said high medical malpractice insurance costs are a major contributing factor to a statewide doctor shortage. 
Think New Mexico, whose leaders are scheduled to speak at the GOP hearing on Monday, also advocates for the state to join more interstate medical compacts to address health care worker shortages,, and last week said failure to do so quickly could put the state’s rural hospitals at risk.
The state’s health care labor landscape came up Tuesday during a meeting of the Legislative Finance Committee, during which analysts released results from a secret shopper survey from August. LFC analysts called 256 primary care physicians and 259 doctors for behavioral health care appointments under Medicaid. They found it took six phone calls, on average, to secure an appointment.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The executive director of Indiana’s public retirement system cautioned lawmakers Wednesday that an effort to aggressively pay down unfunded liabilities won’t immediately free up more dollars — instead saying further analysis would be needed.
The Indiana Public Retirement System oversees nearly $55 billion in assets for 551,000 members across 16 accounts. The overall funding status of the system increased from 81% to 83.2% in the last year.
The state’s largest unfunded liability continues to be the Teachers’ Pre-1996 Defined Benefit Account, which has $3.1 billion in unfunded liabilities. The state budget dedicates $1 billion annually to pay down that account — which is on-track to reach funded status by 2028 or 2029, depending on market conditions.
“Everybody is anxious for that day that this money gets 100% funded,” said Steve Russo, INPRS’ executive director. “Anxious about, maybe, what they do with the money. But I want to be sure that it’s well understood the potential risk of this thing.”
He warned that the state would have to continually monitor, and potentially pay, to keep that funded status as market conditions shift. There’s also always a risk of a major economic downturn. 
“We definitely look forward to engaging and collaborating, not only with just the leadership, but also the administration and the legislature,” Russo said. 
Lawmakers, particularly Senate Republicans, have added large chunks of cash to accelerate payment of the debt in recent years when the state was flush with revenue. And leaders have eagerly waited for the day the state no longer pays $1 billion annually toward the fund. Those dollars could, instead, be used to invest in other programs or to further trim down Indiana’s marginal income tax rate.
Russo also assured members of the Interim Study Committee on Pension Management Oversight that investments complied with requirements to divest from foreign adversaries, including China.
This comes after the Indianapolis Star pointed out the state had holdings in Hong Kong. Now the agency will divest.

MILFORD – At a time when understanding democracy is critical to the health of the nation, Milford Senior High School is earning national attention for its commitment to civics education. Leading that effort is educator Shae Parks, a seventh-year teacher whose work to make civics engaging and relevant has earned her the prestigious American Civic Education Teacher Award (ACETA).
Parks, who holds a Master of Science in Curriculum & Instruction from Kansas University, is one of only a handful of educators nationwide recognized by the Center for Civic Education, Indiana University’s Center on Representative Government, and the National Education Association. The award honors classroom teachers who provide students with both the knowledge of how government works and the skills and motivation to participate in civic life.
Bringing Civics to Life
As a dedicated civics educator, Parks believes the subject is far more than memorizing facts—it’s about understanding how government decisions affect everyday life and how citizens can influence them. She uses current events, local issues, and community partnerships to connect students to the civic world, organizing Civics Learning Week activities, collaborating with the League of Women Voters of Delaware, and inviting local and state leaders to speak in her classroom.
“Teaching civics has been essential since our country was founded,” Parks said. “For our democracy to thrive, citizens must have the skills and the knowledge to participate in government—and the desire to do so. That disposition to be an engaged citizen can only be developed through meaningful interactions with others, and that’s not something you can easily re-create outside of a school building in today’s world.”
Empowering Student Voices
Outside the classroom, Parks advises Milford’s Student Government Association, helping students organize pep rallies, homecoming, and prom. But she views student government as much more than school spirit.“Student government, and student-led organizations like it, are what build the sense of responsibility and empowerment that students need to be impactful members of society,” she explained.
Her dedication to civic engagement has also earned her two selections to the University of Delaware Biden School of Public Administration’s Democracy Project Institute for Teachers, where she shares strategies for strengthening civics education statewide.
Looking Toward America’s 250th
As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Parks is focusing on helping students bring America’s founding ideals to life. “Right now my biggest focus is finding ways to bring our founding documents to life for students,” she said, noting that the milestone offers a powerful opportunity to connect the past to today’s civic challenges.
A Community Commitment
The ACETA program highlights the unique role schools play in sustaining democracy. “A free society relies on the civic knowledge, skills, and virtue of its citizens,” the award’s mission states. “Schools bear a unique responsibility for developing civic competence and civic responsibility.”
Through her innovative approach, educator Shae Parks ensures Milford students graduate with more than just textbook knowledge. They leave with the confidence and commitment to participate in civic life—proving that strong civics education is not only vital to the classroom, but to the future of the community and the country.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shae-Parks.jpg,,,2025-09-24 13:58:14.340791

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, a Florida Republican proposes to ban state agencies from mentioning the West Bank, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, and enforce “Judea and Samaria” as the official name for the middle eastern battleground.
Rep. Chase Tramont, a Port Orange Republican, introduced HB 31 Tuesday in hopes of replacing the “West Bank” phrase with the biblical name for the regions north and south of Jerusalem and widely used by right-wing Israelis to describe the Jordan River territory.
The move comes amid strong Floridian support for Israel and an overall split in foreign politics on whether to back Israel in its campaign to eradicate Hamas, a designated terrorist organization backed by Iran, or recognize Palestine as a state following allegations that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is orchestrating a genocide.
“It is the intent of the Legislature to refer to the land annexed by Israel from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War by its historical name of ‘Judea and Samaria,'” Tramont’s bill reads. “A state agency may not use the term ‘West Bank’  to refer to Judea and Samaria in an official government material or use moneys to create an official government material that refers to Judea and Samaria as ‘West Bank.”
It does create an exception for agency heads to waive the prohibition if they determine using “West Bank” is in Florida’s “best interest” and send a written explanation within a month of the realization to the Senate President and Speaker of the House, the bills says.
A congressional copy…
HB 31 is a near replica of a federal bill introduced in February by House and Senate Republicans, although the measure has yet to advance to a vote. It referenced Israel’s annexation of the territory from Jordan in 1967, citing its historical claim to the ancient “Judea and Samaria.” Since then, the Israeli military has occupied the area.
“The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria goes back thousands of years,” Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton said at the time, The New York Times reported. He asked for the U.S. to “stop using the politically charged term West Bank.”
Following Hamas’s ambush and murder of more than a thousand Israelis during music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has launched a no-holds-barred counter-offensive deep into Palestinian-occupied areas in the Gaza Strip. Florida officials reacted quickly, passing resolutions strongly backing Israel and punishing businesses that boycott its government.
Gov. Ron DeSantis hosted a slew of press conferences statewide to decry pro-Palestinian protesters setting up encampments on university campuses, encouraging the U.S. government to revoke their student visas. Months later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio obliged.
Since then, Netanyahu has come under fire from prominent peace organizations including the United Nations. A UN commission of inquiry released a report last week claiming he’s led a genocide in Gaza. Despite this, top U.S. officials continue to tout their strong relationship with Israel, a leading Middle East ally for the United States, to the point that President Donald Trump in June dropped bunker-buster bombs in Iran in coordination with Israel.

The 10 members present at Wednesday’s meeting voted to refer House Bills 4556 and 4557 to the House floor for further consideration. The policies were introduced by state Reps. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) and Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth). 
Michigan’s merit examination consists of three components:  the College Board SAT, the ACT’s WorkKeys job skills assessment and the Michigan Standardized Test for Educational Progress – or M-STEP test – for science and social studies. The three exams are administered to 11th grade students and eligible 12th graders every spring.
If these bills pass, schools would no longer require students to complete an essay portion as part of the SAT, and their scores in each subject area would not be included on their high school transcript, which is used in college admissions. 
“Students leading up to the SAT are going through study sessions, they’re going through all these different academic strategies, all these things to try to do the best they can on this test,” Koleszar told committee members during a previous meeting. “They take the test, and then after this exhausting test is over they’re handed a writing portion to the SAT that schools are not using the data for, that it has no impact on their college admission whatsoever.” 
Schools similarly do not use the data from the ACT WorkKeys assessment, or the M-STEP test, Koleszar said, emphasizing the strain the assessments place on students.
“[Students] are beat, they’re exhausted and schools aren’t using the data, so the question begs to be asked, why would we put those scores on a transcript?” Koleszar said.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Time to lawyer up.
That’s the conclusion of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, which voted unanimously at its Tuesday meeting to enlist its legal counsel to crack down on Quidnessett Country Club for failing to comply with state coastal rules.
The decision comes after more than two years of warnings, negotiations and deadline extensions as coastal regulators tried to reach an agreement with the North Kingstown country club over the removal of a 600-foot-long rock wall built without permission along its shoreline. 
Opposing sides continued to butt heads Tuesday over details of the required plan to remove the wall and restore the shoreline along Narragansett Bay to its natural state. 
Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney representing the 1,000-member country club, continued to make the case for replacing the rock wall with a row of biodegradable, geotextile sandbags to shield the club’s golf course from rising sea levels. But coastal staff maintain the products from Florida company Trapbag violate state coastal restrictions, which expressly prohibit anything but non-structural barriers in environmentally sensitive coastal habits like the shoreline overlooking Narragansett Bay.
Also in dispute: how far inland to put any barrier to meet state public access law and other coastal requirements, and the type and amount of native vegetation that must be replanted after the stone wall is removed.
“The restoration criteria are not arbitrary,” Emily Hall, a CRMC coastal geologist, said Tuesday. “To disregard any of the three requirements would allow prohibited activities to continue on the shoreline.”
Yet Cervenka insisted the country club was not “recalcitrant,” pointing to the seven versions of a shoreline restoration plan submitted over the last year, even though all were rejected by agency staff for failing to meet coastal requirements. 
“The last two [plans] in particular, we believe, struck a proper balance between what’s required under the program and the protection of our property,” said Cervenka, who previously chaired the appointed panel of coastal regulators.


Lurking unspoken but present in the debate: two lawsuits brought by Quidnessett against the CRMC. The first, filed in July in Providence County Superior Court, contests the procedural process the council followed in reviewing the case. On Sept. 8 came a second complaint, alleging the agency violated the country club’s constitutional property rights and asking a Superior Court judge to redesignate the coastal waters to allow for development.
The dispute over the water type designation started shortly after the CRMC issued a cease-and-desist order against the country club in August 2023, followed by a series of warnings threatening fines. The club initially defended the wall, built the previous winter, as an emergency measure necessary to protect its signature 14th hole. 
After being sanctioned, the country club’s representatives said the “Type 1” designation for the section of Narragansett Bay along its shoreline was incorrect and pushed for a less restrictive label that could allow development such as a rock wall.
The CRMC rejected the application for the water type reclassification in January, shifting focus to details of the location and materials used to restore the shoreline to its pre-wall condition.
Hall acknowledged the multiple concessions made by coastal staff to accommodate Quidnessett. But it was obvious to CRMC Chair Ray Coia the two sides reached an impasse over the Trapbag solution. 
“Where do we go from here?” Coia asked. Turning to Cervenka, he said, “I see no concession from Quidnessett because you feel, in your opinion, that Trapbags are allowed. And staff, in looking at the rules and regulations, strongly defend that they are not allowed.”
Council member Kevin Flynn suggested Quidnessett needed to reconfigure its golf course to meet state coastal requirements.
“We’re talking about grass and sand here, Flynn said. “We’re not talking about protecting a building here, or protecting a school.”
Flynn proposed turning the par-5 14th hole into a shorter, par-4 to avoid butting up against the eroding shoreline.
But Cervenka defended the preservation of the golf course in its original 1960 state, as designed by architect Geoffrey Cornish. The rock wall built two-and-a-half years ago was vital to protecting “imminent harm to property and persons,” she declared.
Michael Reuter, the newest appointee to the CRMC who was confirmed in March 2025, shrugged off Cervenka’s plea.
“If it was so vital, you should have come to us first,” he said. “Why not get an emergency permit?”
The council’s vote Tuesday does not specify how its legal counsel will seek to enforce its existing order requiring removal of the rock wall and restoration of the shoreline. And negotiations over plan details can still continue if Quidnessett is willing to work toward resolution, Anthony DeSisto, the council’s attorney, said. 
The council’s June 10 order gave the country club three months — until Oct. 8 — to remove the wall and restore its shoreline.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment in an emailed response Wednesday. 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said it’s still unclear how the case is going to play out in an interview Wednesday. 
Thorp outlined various scenarios that could follow. One: a court order setting a deadline for Quidnessett to take the wall down and/or details of a restoration plan, a prospect he expected the country club would appeal. Or, a judge could side with Quidnessett in its initial lawsuit arguing that the CRMC should have referred the case to its hearing officer. That would force a redo of the entire review process before the agency’s designated lawyer for disputed cases. Finally, there remains the possibility of settlement outside court.
“What matters to us at the end of the day is when is this wall going to get taken down and when is the site going to get restored,” Thorp said. “Whatever option gets us to that quickest is what we’re going to want to see.”
The council ended its meeting with a scheduled, closed-door discussion about the lawsuits filed by Quidnessett. Members returned to open session after 10 minutes, voting unanimously to authorize its legal counsel to act on its behalf. The CRMC has not yet submitted responses to either of the Quidnessett lawsuits, according to public court dockets.

(Photo of Blue Ridge mountains by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As we remember Hurricane Helene’s devastation, too many people and communities are just beginning to rebuild. Yet one year after this historic storm, decisions at both the state and federal levels are undermining efforts to protect lives and property from future disasters.
To safeguard people and communities we must protect existing natural flood control features, like wetlands, fully fund pre-disaster programs, and ensure federal and state agencies coordinate with local needs. Today, our wetlands are at risk, disaster preparedness programs are defunded, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is hobbled.
Wetland Flood Protections Undermined
In 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Sackett v. EPA decision severely limiting wetland protections. Experts warned the outcomes could range from bad to catastrophic. New federal guidance now points toward the catastrophic end of that spectrum.
Research by Environmental Defense Fund scientist Dr. Adam Gold shows that 500,000 to 3.6 million acres of wetlands in North Carolina may no longer be protected depending on federal and state rules. With the EPA proposing an extreme interpretation of the Sackett decision, more than 3 million acres of wetlands across North Carolina could now be destroyed, putting more people and communities at-risk of flooding.
Disaster Preparedness Programs Defunded
Hurricane Helene was only the latest in a string of costly disasters to hit North Carolina. Communities need proactive investments to break the cycle of repeated losses. FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program offered exactly that.
Created in 2018 with bipartisan support during the previous Trump Administration, BRIC funded projects to build flood protection and ensure resilient infrastructure and communities.The program’s value was clear: one dollar invested in resilience saves $13 in avoided damages. Yet earlier this year, the Trump Administration defunded BRIC entirely.
For North Carolina, this means halting at least $164 million in projects already selected across the state. That’s money that would have protected families, businesses and tax dollars from future storms. Instead, communities remain exposed, and recovery costs will only rise. The math is simple: the cost of doing something now is far less than the cost of doing nothing or trying to do it later.
Coordination and Capacity Diminished
Local communities and individual residents should not be expected to prepare for and recover from Helene-sized storms by themselves. Yet FEMA is being hollowed out and weakened. The ability to train, coordinate, and support local communities is diminished.
FEMA has also ended its door-to-door outreach in disaster areas, a change that makes it harder for vulnerable residents, like the elderly or those without transportation, to access aid. It also places undue burden on our rural residents who have to drive even greater distances.
Local and state governments often must front recovery costs while waiting for FEMA reimbursements. Delays and freezes now leave counties struggling to repair infrastructure and maintain services. For small towns already operating on tight budgets, this is an impossible burden.
Taken together, these federal rollbacks leave North Carolina communities more vulnerable to both storms and slow recoveries.
State and Federal Action Urgently Needed
In a bipartisan effort, a US House of Representatives committee advanced the FEMA Act by a vote of 60-3 earlier this month. The legislation establishes FEMA as a cabinet agency and makes changes to pre- and post-disaster policies, programs, and processes in an effort to simplify disaster assistance for victims, incentivize disaster preparedness, improve coordination amongst federal agencies, and increase transparency and accountability.
North Carolina Representatives Rouzer, McDowell, and Foushee all voted in favor of moving the bill through committee. Representative Edwards, while not on the committee, is a co-sponsor of the legislation.
In North Carolina, the General Assembly should recognize the bipartisan need to reduce flood risks and future disaster risks by prioritizing wetlands conservation to safeguard natural flood defenses and supporting nature-based solutions like restoration opportunities and green infrastructure, which are affordable, rapidly deployable and provide multiple benefits for clean water and wildlife.
North Carolina has endured storm after storm. We know what’s at stake. It’s time for our leaders to act – before the next hurricane reminds us, yet again, of the cost of doing nothing.

Lee Rupp wore many hats during his lifetime — Marine, lawmaker, conservationist, lobbyist, volunteer firefighter and faithful member of a Columbus coffee club.
But his friends, including Gov. Jim Pillen, say he would want to be remembered for his service to others.
“He was just one of those guys who gave back. I don’t know where he got that, but he gave and gave and gave,” said long-time friend Jerry Engdahl of Columbus.
Rupp, who served seven years in the Nebraska Legislature, died Sunday. He was 87.
Rupp was born near Monroe, Nebraska, and worked as a fisheries biologist for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission until 1982, when he won a seat in the state Legislature. In 1989, he resigned to become the director of legislative affairs for the University of Nebraska, a post he held for 11 years.
As a state senator, he supported legislation that involved wildlife and agriculture. Rupp won support for opening a hunting season for elk in Nebraska — a hunt he joked he never got to enjoy because he never was able to draw a permit, Engdahl said.
An avid hunter, Rupp’s dedication to the outdoors led the Nebraska Wildlife Federation to name him “Conservationist of the Year” in 1978 and the Game and Parks Commission, in 2021, to rename a wildlife area south of Monroe the “Lee Rupp Wildlife Management Area.”
He also was a faithful member of the Picket Fence Coffee Club, which meets six days a week at a downtown Columbus cafe, and the OFC, or “Old Farts Club,” a group that holds regular dinner meetings.
Pillen, a life-long friend who grew up near the Rupp farm, posted a statement this week saying that Rupp had a significant influence on his life and his decision to run for governor.
“Lee had a passion for Nebraska. He enjoyed the outdoors, understood agriculture and was deeply committed to preserving our state’s natural resources,” the governor said. “I appreciated Lee’s counsel throughout the years and will greatly miss his friendship.”
Kay Rupp, the senator’s widow, said by text message that Lee would want to be remembered for “his love and pride for his family, his state and his country.”
“And he tried to reflect that by serving others throughout his life,” she wrote.
Former Nebraska Lt. Gov. Kim Robak, who grew up in Columbus, said Rupp was a steady advocate for the University of Nebraska, who never put the institution in a bad light.
Besides his wife, Rupp is survived by two daughters, Lori Hodtwalker and Lisa Brestel, a son, Mark, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
A funeral service is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday at Peace Lutheran Church in Columbus.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)  With the November election just six weeks away, experts for and against the statewide referendum question proposing a red flag law participated in a televised town hall Tuesday night. 
Proponents were represented by psychiatrist David Moltz and former Public Safety Commissioner Anne Jordan, while David Trahan, the head of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, and Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) spoke for the opposition. 
The four presented their reasons why Maine voters should support or reject Question 2 on the November ballot. It will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
Maine already has what’s known as a yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. 
Though law enforcement has reported that the law is cumbersome, there has been increased use since the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston in which 18 people were killed. In late August, the state Department of Public Safety announced that more than 1,000 orders to seize dangerous weapons have been issued since the law took effect in 2019.
The shooting in Lewiston reinvigorated the conversation around extreme risk protection orders after an independent commission found that local law enforcement had sufficient probable cause to both take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody under Maine’s yellow flag law and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. 
“Our yellow flag law, as you’ve discussed, was an experiment — the only one like it in the nation — and it failed,” said Jordan, who also served as executive director of the independent commission that gathered facts about the Lewiston shooting.
She went on to say that a red flag law would provide another “effective tool” to allow families and household members to petition the court when they have concerns about someone’s potential for danger to themself or others. 
If the referendum passes, it would not replace Maine’s current law, but would be an additional tool police or the general public can use to temporarily confiscate weapons. 
However, Trahan pointed out that Maine State Police argued in a public hearing before the Legislature that having both laws on the books would be confusing. 
“That is the very agency that we depend on,” he said, “that is supposed to keep the public safe. When they stand up there and say, ‘This is going to make it less safe and more dangerous for everyone involved,’ then we should listen to them. Vote ‘no’ on 2.”
What is a red flag law?
Red flag laws are active in twenty-one states, including four states in New England. Maine is the only state with a yellow flag law. 
The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
A court would be required to schedule a hearing within 14 days of when the petition is filed. If the court finds the individual does pose a significant risk of causing physical injury, the court must issue an order prohibiting them from purchasing, possessing or receiving a dangerous weapon for up to one year. The person would need to immediately surrender any dangerous weapons in their possession to law enforcement.
A person could request to have the order terminated if they can show evidence that they no longer pose a risk of physical harm. Conversely, an order can also be renewed for up to one additional year.

In March 2023, former Elgin City Clerk Rhonda Dales was named in a state audit report that identified $131,213 in improper disbursements by the city and an additional $7,532 in disbursements for which there was no supporting documentation.
The questionable spending cited by the auditor included:
— Excess payroll payments to Dales: $60,726.
— Unauthorized comp time for Dales: $27,451
— Unauthorized paid time off for Dales: $9,863
— Improper reimbursement payments to Dales: $19,204
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report noted that much of the questionable spending was tied to pay and benefits collected by Dales in violation of city policies. However, the report also noted that regardless of the policy, city council members did not agree as to whether Dales, as a part-time employee, was entitled to such payments.
According to the auditor’s office, its investigation stemmed from a May 2021 Elgin City Council meeting at which Dales was informed she was being fired due to concerns with her job performance. Because of the concerns, city officials asked state auditors to review the city’s financial records from 2017 through June 2021.
Within days of the auditor’s report being released in 2023, Fayette County officials criminally charged Dales with felony first-degree theft. Dales pleaded not guilty, and the case was initially scheduled for trial in July 2023.
Court records show that over the next two-and-a-half years, judges granted 14 continuances in the case, and on Aug. 22, 2025, Fayette County prosecutor Jason Dunn reduced the charge from felony first-degree theft to misdemeanor fourth-degree theft, alleging Dales stole no more than $750 worth of property from the city.
Dales pleaded guilty to the charge and on Sept. 3, 2025, was fined $430 and placed on informal probation for one year. There was no restitution ordered in the case.










This is very disappointing ... I feel bad because I'm also a taxpayer with the City of Elgin.


– Elgin Mayor Jim Knobloch


“This is very disappointing,” Elgin Mayor Jim Knobloch said Tuesday, adding that he was surprised by the outcome of the matter given the $37,000 in expenses the city incurred just for commissioning the state audit.
“The courts of the land have spoken and are saying this is worth a $430 fine,” Knobloch said. “It is what it is. I feel bad because I’m also a taxpayer with the City of Elgin.”
Knobloch said that at one point, he met with a county prosecutor about the case but “I just felt, like, ‘I’m wasting my time here.'”
Dunn and Fayette County Attorney Nathan Lein did not respond to calls Tuesday from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
In an interview Tuesday, Dales said Dunn had indicated to her earlier this year that he wasn’t sure how to prosecute the case “since no money was missing,” and that the state attorney general’s office had declined to take over the case.
Dales said the criminal case stemmed from local officials’ desire for “revenge” against after she reported that Knobloch appeared to be sexually harassing her. Knobloch said all of the allegations of harassment against him were “debunked” by the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.
“That was all thrown out,” he said. “That was false.”
Dales said that’s not the case and provided the Iowa Capital Dispatch with a copy of the right-to-sue letter the commission granted her on Dec. 12, 2024. While the letter doesn’t amount to a ruling on the merits of Dales’ civil rights complaint, a right-to-sue letter is issued only in cases where there’s a finding of probable cause, allowing a complainant to pursue litigation.
As for the findings of Iowa Auditor of State Rob Sand, Dales said Sand wanted to make a name for himself by claiming to have ferreted out wrongdoing by local officials. “He used this as a platform to get his face out in public,” Dales said of Sand. “He went around the state telling people how many clerks he had charged with embezzlement.”
“Elgin city officials asked for this investigation, and we’re glad they did,” Sand said in a written response to Dales’ claims. “We stand by our report, which showed over $130,000 of improper self-dealings. Any prosecutor in the state of Iowa who has questions about how to do justice for taxpayers knows how to get a hold of the Attorney General’s Office or me.”
Dales pointed out that many of the auditor’s findings were tied to her receipt of insurance coverage, comp time and other benefits as a part-time employee of the city. “My harasser was saying I wasn’t entitled to it because I was only working 30 hours per week, and so I broke the law by collecting those insurance benefits,” she said. “There is no such law, but Sand went along with it.”
According to the auditor’s report, the findings of wrongdoing were based on the benefits being contrary to city policy. The report highlighted several deficiencies in financial oversight by the council, noting that the city didn’t follow its own personnel policies and, as a result, Dales “periodically paid herself” for more hours worked than the council had ever authorized.
“The lack of appropriate oversight and the failure to ensure implementation of adequate internal controls permitted an employee to exercise too much control over the financial operations of the city,” the report concluded.

(Courtesy photo/Innovation Law Lab)A wildland firefighter who was arrested by immigration agents while fighting a wildfire in Washington state has been released from detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, his attorneys said Wednesday.
Rigoberto Hernandez Hernandez was freed Tuesday after nearly four weeks in detention at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. Hernandez is now back home in Oregon with his family, said Matt Adams, legal director with the Northwest Immigration Rights Project, which is representing him.
The group, along with attorneys at Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab, said that the arrest of Hernandez was illegal and violated due process. The groups’ petition for habeas corpus is still pending.
Firefighters question leaders’ role in Washington immigration raid

Adams said the government has dismissed its proceedings to remove Hernandez from the country.
“They’re acknowledging that there’s no justification for this arrest or this type of enforcement action targeting people who are on the front lines working to keep our community safe,” Adams said in an interview.
Attorneys for Hernandez filed the habeas corpus petition on Friday, and the government’s response was due at noon on Tuesday, Adams said. Rather than refuting the claims of due process violations, ICE released Hernandez around midday on Tuesday.
“I am glad that I am home, and I am excited to see my family,” Hernandez said in the statement issued by the legal groups. “I want to give my thanks to everyone — for their prayers, for the rallies, for sharing about what happened to me and the other firefighter. So many people stepped up to help, and now I want to help others just like they helped me.”
The immigration raid last month at the Bear Gulch fire in Washington state sent shockwaves through the wildland fire community. Wildfire veterans say it was a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Hernandez and another firefighter were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which claimed they were in the country illegally. Federal immigration officials have also falsely claimed that the crews were not firefighters. 
According to Innovation Law Lab, Hernandez has lived on the West Coast since he was 4 years old and worked as a firefighter for the past three years. He applied for a U-visa in 2018, an application that is still pending due to government backlogs. 
“This story just highlights how far astray this whole immigration enforcement regime has gone,” Adams said. “They’re out there in the middle of a disaster zone randomly targeting firefighters. This has nothing to do with community safety, it’s just this message of this war on immigrants.”

Tim Taylor, fifth from right, listen to testimony at a hearing Wednesday, Aug. 27 in Macon. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)
Members of a special House committee talked Tuesday through a multitude of potential solutions to relieve the tax burden facing Missourians.


“The committee’s goal is to find common sense reforms and solutions that will protect homeowners, promote economic stability and share capability,” said Rep. Tim Taylor, R-Bunceton, chair of the Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform.


The committee conducted six hearings in five separate cities across the state this past summer. In the 25 hours of testimony, they heard complaints from residents and local officials related to property tax evaluation and assessment.

Republican members of the committee agreed that there is no “one size fits all” option when it comes to deciding the allocation of taxation at the county level. Taylor noted that 72% of property taxes fund public schools.


In response, Rep. Del Taylor, D-St. Louis, said he wants the state to get involved because it is the buffer when local districts fall short on funding for schools in particular.


Multiple potential solutions were mentioned at the meeting.


Among the proposals was the committee chair’s idea of expanding the ability of districts to institute a sales tax instead of a property tax to fund public schools. Others raised concerns of possible double dipping under that model.

“I would be opposed to anything that allowed any level of governance to double collect taxes,” said Rep. Darin Chappell, R-Rogersville. “I would be absolutely opposed for the opportunity to exist for both methodologies to be active at the same time.”


The committee is faced with navigating 40-year-old bill language to deal with modern assessment and taxation issues. Rep. Rodger Reedy, R-Windsor, laid out the term plainly: “We as legislators have failed to keep up with the times.”


Further complicating the potential for solutions is the Hancock Amendment, enacted in 1980 to limit the amount of money that can be extracted through taxation. A provision in the amendment states that property tax rates have to be adjusted to avoid windfall revenue increases as a result of rapid increases in values.


The amendment is one of the many challenges the committee faces. Members agreed that they had no appetite for attempting to change the Missouri Constitution by seeking to adjust the Hancock Amendment.

“The more I’ve been in this committee, the more I’ve felt that we have got a large sandbox we can play in when it comes to statute. Can we try to play in that sandbox and stay away from the constitution for now?” said Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, D-Columbia.


Both Steinhoff, and Rep. Dean Van Schoiack, R-Savannah, said they felt that the discussion went well and that progress towards a potential bill was made. Both said they anticipate further meetings and discussions that could continue into the start of the legislative session in January.

Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, launched his campaign Wednesday for the U.S. Senate, setting up a high-stakes 2026 challenge to three-term Democratic Sen. Mark Warner.
Reeves made his announcement on social media, leaning heavily on his background in the military, law enforcement and the General Assembly.
“I’ll never back down when it comes to protecting Virginia,” Reeves wrote. “From the Army to walking the streets as a cop to the State Senate, I have always put our families first. Now I am running for U.S. Senate to protect our way of life and secure a stronger future.”
Reeves could not immediately be reached by phone Wednesday.
Democrats quickly moved to cast him as out of step with the state. Chris Bolling, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Reeves’ campaign is proof Republicans are already looking past this fall’s elections.
“In yet another sign that Republicans have given up on this year’s governor’s race, candidates are starting to announce for elections over a year away,” Bolling said. He dismissed Reeves as “a perennial candidate who is best known for running and losing elections” and argued that his record would weigh him down.
“Now he’s gearing up to lose another by tying himself to (President Donald) Trump’s deeply unpopular agenda of cutting taxes for the richest while attacking Virginians’ health care,” Bolling said. 
He pointed out that Reeves opposed Medicaid expansion in Virginia, which he noted has provided coverage to hundreds of thousands across the commonwealth. “Virginians know Mark Warner delivers results and they won’t trade that for another Trump loyalist looking for a promotion,” Bolling added.
According to his campaign website, Reeves, 58, grew up in modest circumstances, often citing his mother’s advice that education was about service and leadership. He and his brother were the first in their family to attend college, with Reeves earning recognition as a Distinguished Military Graduate from Texas A&M before serving as an Army Ranger and infantry officer.
After leaving the military, Reeves worked as a narcotics detective in Prince William County. He later entered politics, winning a seat in the Virginia Senate in 2011.
Following redistricting, Reeves was elected in 2023 to represent the newly drawn 28th District, which covers Culpeper, Greene, Madison, Orange and Rappahannock counties, as well as portions of Fauquier and Spotsylvania counties.
In the Senate, he serves on the Commerce and Labor, Finance and Appropriations, General Laws and Technology, and Rehabilitation and Social Services committees. He also co-chairs the General Assembly Military and Veterans Caucus and the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Military and Veterans Affairs Task Force.
In recent years, Reeves has pursued legislation on issues ranging from hate crimes to fentanyl trafficking. 
In 2024, he carried a bill to update Virginia’s hate crime statutes to better address rising antisemitism and other forms of ethnic animosity. He also sponsored legislation that classified non-medical fentanyl as a “weapon of terrorism” and pushed for the establishment of a Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee.
Reeves backed economic ties with Taiwan, sponsoring a bill that ultimately led Gov. Glenn Youngkin to order a cost-benefit analysis of opening a Virginia trade office there.
Outside the Capitol, Reeves has cultivated an image as a community volunteer and conservative family man. He lives in Orange County with his two dogs, Ozzy and Gator, and has served as a youth football and lacrosse coach, a Christian deacon and missionary and a mentor.
Reeves says that experience fuels his bid to represent Virginia in Washington. His website portrays him as a fighter who “will lead the fight against the radical left, defend our conservative values, and work with President Trump to deliver real results.”
Warner, a former governor first elected to the Senate in 2008, has not formally announced his reelection bid but is widely expected to run. Seen as a centrist Democrat, Warner — who  served as Virginia’s governor from 2002 to 2006 — has won three consecutive terms, though Republicans view the seat as a potential pickup if national trends break their way.
Reeves is the second Republican to officially declare for the race, after Fairfax County resident Kim Farington announced her bid.

The site for research work that’s relevant to state policy will become a showcase for research from organizations across California starting in 2026.


The Knowledge Hub, a new CalMatters feature that will be the home for meaningful research that informs California policy, is now live, with the UC Berkeley Possibility Lab as the exclusive launch partner. 
“Policymaking for a strong democracy requires high-quality research and accurate information,” said CalMatters CEO Neil Chase. “We’re proud that the Knowledge Hub will help everyone, from legislators to the Californians who elect them and guide their decisions, to be smarter about the most crucial issues we face.”
The hub launched with original research from the Possibility Lab, which describes itself as “a team of policy researchers and practitioners who partner with government and community to design and scale data-driven innovations for the public good.”
“Too often, groundbreaking research gets published, placed on a shelf, and forgotten, rarely reaching the policy staff and decision-makers who might benefit from it the most,” said Amy E. Lerman, professor of political science and public policy at UC Berkeley and executive director of the Possibility Lab. The Knowledge Hub will include research reports, data, tools and explainers that meet CalMatters’ standards for quality and accuracy. 
In the first installment of its series, the research team at the UC Berkeley Possibility Lab explores the trade-offs, perspectives, partnerships, and policies that can help California build fast while also building fair, to ensure access to essential goods and services for all state residents, called “People-Centered Policymaking.”
The exclusive launch partnership will enable the Possibility Lab to spotlight new reports from its Abundance Policy Research Consortium, as part of its Abundance Accelerator. The Lab will also release reports related to its partnerships with state departments and agencies focused on its IMPACT Model for civic engagement. The Lab is providing financial support for the launch of the Hub. Researchers from around the state will be invited to share materials through the Hub beginning in Winter 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01_Home_Main-graphic.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 12:57:57.061825

By their 18th birthday, about 3 in 4 children nationwide relied on Medicaid, CHIP (which subsidizes health care for children and pregnant women in families that earn too much for Medicaid), or the subsidized insurance marketplaces established through the 2010 Affordable Care Act — or experienced a period during their childhood without health insurance, the study found.
Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted estimates based on analyses of national data from 2015 to 2019, looking at cumulative coverage rates over the course of childhood.

The study comes as states grapple with federal Medicaid cuts under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tax and spending law will reduce Medicaid funding by $1 trillion and cut enrollment by 10 million to 15 million people over the next decade, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office.
About 42% of children suffered a period of losing health coverage at any point in time by their 18th birthday, the Harvard researchers found, and 61% had at some point enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. About 78.5% were at some point enrolled in employment-based insurance.
Rates of children who lost insurance coverage were higher in states that hadn’t expanded Medicaid income eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare. Roughly 59% of children in non-expansion states had periods without any insurance coverage — compared with 36% in expansion states. Overall, about 2 in 5 children experienced periods without health insurance, the study found.
And states with the strictest income thresholds saw the highest share of kids losing coverage who previously were covered by Medicaid or CHIP at birth.
“Upcoming changes to Medicaid could affect a significant portion of children and worsen already substantial insurance gaps,” senior author Nicolas Menzies,an  associate professor of global health and faculty member in the school’s Center for Health Decision Science, said in a statement. 
“We’re particularly worried about explicit loss of public insurance eligibility for noncitizen children; spillover effects through parental Medicaid coverage losses due to work requirements and more eligibility checks; and state-level cuts to Medicaid.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday joined a private prison company in its legal fight with Leavenworth, Kansas, city officials, accusing the city of “aggressive and unlawful” interference with immigration enforcement.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the case in U.S. District Court, signed by the assistant U.S. attorney general’s office.
“The United States has a strong interest in countering state and local efforts to harass federal contractors, in the proper application of the Constitution and its Supremacy Clause, and in the foundational principles that protect the Federal Government from unconstitutional state and local interference,” the filing said.
A statement of interest authorizes the U.S. attorney general to become a non-party in a suit pending in any court in the country, the filing said.
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been fighting in court for months over the city’s requirement that CoreCivic go through its development process to receive a special use permit before reopening its prison facility at 100 Highway Terrace.
Nashville-based CoreCivic announced in March that it would reopen the prison facility, which closed in 2021, to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
CoreCivic and the city have a hearing scheduled Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Topeka as part of an appeal of a Kansas court’s decision barring CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees while the case about the development permit is being heard.
CoreCivic has alleged in multiple filings that Leavenworth officials are violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and interfering with the operations of the federal government. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
The U.S. government’s statement Tuesday pushed that argument forward, saying that it is “especially true” in relationship to immigration.
“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the federal filing said, citing multiple cases to support its arguments that federal contractors are free from state control.
“This well-settled principle has been consistently applied to invalidate state and local laws that impose requirements on federal contractors,” the filing said.
The city’s efforts to prevent CoreCivic from housing immigration detainees at its prison, recently renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center, is an attempt to regulate the federal government’s efforts to house detainees at that facility and violates the supremacy clause, the filing said.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers on Tuesday had their first chance to press the state Ethics Commission chair about its recent lawsuit alleging state probation officers referred immigrants under their supervision to federal immigration law enforcement.
The lawsuit’s allegations, if true, could violate a law the Legislature passed with a wide margin earlier this year that prohibits state employees from sharing private personal information, including immigration status, with non-state actors, including ICE. The law went into effect July 1.
Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque), a sponsor of the Nondisclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Act, applauded the commission for moving so quickly to enforce a bill she championed. 
“I was outraged that so soon after it was passed, that these probation officials would [allegedly] violate it so blatantly,” she said during the Legislature’s interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee meeting in Albuquerque, adding that she hopes other law enforcement agencies step up and start investigating similar violations of law that “really put our people in New Mexico at risk of danger.”
The commission alleges probation officers lured at least three immigrants with long ties to New Mexico to their offices under false pretenses for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainment. The three people have either been deported or remain in ICE custody.

The suit also alleges that probation officers initially began contacting ICE agents to remove “problem probationers” — ones convicted of serious crimes or difficult to supervise — but that recently the practice has extended to “any individual who certain probation officers suspected of having an unlawful presence in the United States,” according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment from a judge that the commission can move forward with a lawsuit against the Corrections Department for its employees’ alleged conduct. The commission writes that a potential conflict may exist with federal laws and is asking the judge to weigh in.
The suit names Corrections Secretary Alisha Tafoya, who has not yet been served with the lawsuit, according to court filings. A spokesperson for her agency previously declined to comment on Source New Mexico’s questions about the lawsuit for that reason. 
Tafoya also declined the committee’s invitation to appear during the hearing Tuesday, according to Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces).
Jeremy Farris, the commission’s executive director, did appear before the committee, but he said he was largely limited in what he could say, given the ongoing lawsuit. Still, he explained some of the context surrounding the suit, including why the relatively new Ethics Commission is taking the lead.
The commission, first created in 2018 to look into governmental misconduct and election code violations, is also empowered under the NSPI Act to investigate alleged violations, along with local district attorneys or the New Mexico Department of Justice, Farris said. 
So when the commission received a “complaint” recently containing the allegations, commission staff quickly interviewed witnesses, pored over court documents and prepared for an executive session meeting with the bi-partisan commission board to approve the lawsuit.

Farris did not say who filed the complaint or when. 
The commission’s lawsuit prompted Rep. John Block (R-Alamogordo) to suggest the agency  was prioritizing the investigation of deportation of criminals over his and other ethics complaints.
“I’ve filed complaints before, and usually it’s a very lengthy process,” he said. “Usually it goes to some retired judge who looks at it, takes 1,000 years, and then finally will make a determination if it has standing.”
Farris responded that the authority the NSPI Act gave the commission to investigate violations invokes a different process, more akin to the authority that prosecutors have, than the one individuals undertake when asking the commission to rule on potential ethics violations. 
Shortly after the hearing, Block posted on social media, criticizing the commission for using its authority “to fast-track this case because they are apparently angry that three law-breaking criminal aliens are being deferred to federal law enforcement agencies.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 11:59:38.091438

Here in Vermont, we know access to nature is more than a nicety. We have a responsibility to speak out and make progress from the ground up.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shelby Semmes and Drew McConville: How Vermonters can lead as Washington backslides on conservation.","This commentary is by Shelby Semmes, of Warren, and Drew McConville, of Montpelier. Semmes is the vice president for the New England Region at the Trust for Public Land. McConville is a senior fellow for conservative policy at the Center for American Progress.


In the shade of towering pines, a dozen Vermonters laughed, chatted and occasionally stood in silent awe as they toured the newest public lands expansion in the Green Mountains in the spring. 
Some came as interested neighbors, some as committed supporters and others — like the two of us — attended as hosts, interpreters and advocates for the important work of protecting America’s parks and forests. Surrounded by people immersed in the wonders of ancient trees and boosted by the adrenaline of a speedy hike, conservation work can feel effortless. 
But in the face of strong headwinds from the White House and Congress, there’s little easy about it today. 
The longstanding reality is that Americans love their public lands. Yet, right now, these treasured places are under threat. Drastic policy proposals and budget cuts mark a troubling departure from our nation’s bipartisan commitment to protecting the lands we share. This comes at a time when climate change impacts are accelerating, biodiversity is declining and too many children lack safe, easy access to nature. 
Here in Vermont, we know access to nature is more than a nicety. We have a responsibility to speak out and make progress from the ground up.
Earlier this summer, Congress nearly sold off millions of acres of national forests and other public lands through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”. The Senate version of the bill made more than 250 million acres of public lands eligible for mandated land sales — including popular trails, cultural sites and vital wildlife habitat. Only massive public outcry forced lawmakers to back down.
In the meantime, the Trump administration has fired thousands of park staff, foresters, rangers and land managers while proposing a budget that would cut $4 billion from public lands and hand off smaller national park units for states to manage.
They have also proposed cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which would be especially damaging to Vermont. This successful bipartisan program has helped protect significant sections of the Green Mountain National Forest, the Green River Reservoir State Park, and countless local parks and trails like those at the Catamount Community Forest.
These actions are clearly out of step with Americans’ overwhelming support for conservation. A national survey this year found that the vast majority of Americans — Republicans and Democrats alike — oppose selling or shuttering public lands. In fact, they vote consistently to fund conservation initiatives when given the chance, like in 2024, when ballot measures passed in 11 states, generating more than $16 billion in land conservation funds.
This is especially true in Vermont and across the New England region. From the northern tip of Lake Champlain to Long Island Sound, our natural lands are the backbone of our regional identity and economy. These lands filter our drinking water, clean our air and buffer our towns from increasingly dangerous storms and floods. They fuel an outdoor recreation economy that generates $30 billion annually across New England while also supporting our physical and mental well-being.
But these benefits are not guaranteed. If current trends continue, New England could lose 1.2 million acres of forests and farmland over the next four decades. While many enjoy easy access to nature, those benefits are not equitably distributed — particularly across racial and economic lines.
Meeting this moment means speaking out against the bad ideas flowing from Washington. But it also requires proactive steps from states, communities and individuals working together to build on the strong ideas and leadership already emerging across our region.
In Vermont, state leaders have committed to conserve 30% of the state’s lands by 2030, and communities are leaning toward the goal. Recent expansions to the Green Mountain National Forest — like the 500-acre woods we walked near Wallingford in spring — are raising the tally. 
So are new community forests, like the 735-acre shared backyard of the Wolcott Community Forest, which strengthens the town’s natural defenses against floods, delivers outdoor access near the town center and offers destination-worthy trails for economic development. But to meet our conservation targets on schedule, Vermont will need creative funding and financing streams, and an approach that improves daily living for Vermonters while meeting ecological and climate goals.
Across New England, similar momentum is building — but it also needs support. 
Stretching across state lines, the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership is bringing together governmental and non-governmental partners to protect a landscape that delivers drinking water for nearly 5 million people. Meanwhile, our neighbors in Massachusetts are exploring a Nature for All Fund, which could dedicate a portion of an existing tax on sporting goods to parks and conservation — a funding approach at work in both Texas and Georgia.
As the first leaves of autumn turn, people will return to the forests, trails and mountaintops they treasure. These natural havens support public health and happiness, boost businesses, and strengthen climate defenses for communities large and small. 
Whether it’s a town forest in the Northeast Kingdom or a remote stretch of woods in southern Vermont, these places share something in common. They’re available to everyone because, at some point, people worked to protect them. 
Now, in this challenging moment, it’s up to us all to carry that legacy forward with our voices and actions.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers approved draft legislation Tuesday that aims to clarify how legislators respond when a governor vetoes bills after a legislative session concludes.
The move comes after confusion involving a line-item veto from Gov. Kelly Armstrong that prompted legislators to consider a potential special session.
The draft bill, approved by the interim Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee, would set the third Wednesday of June as the date for reconvening the Legislature to reconsider a vetoed bill. The decision to reconvene would be made by Legislative Management.
Emily Thompson, director of the legal division of Legislative Council, said lawmakers would not be limited to discussing the vetoes. Legislative Management could still recall the assembly to Bismarck at any time, she said. 
Lawmakers are limited to meeting 80 days every two years. The governor has 15 business days to act on bills after lawmakers adjourn.
The proposed bill also would allow the secretary of the Senate or the chief clerk of the House to request and receive the vetoed bills from the Secretary of State’s Office for reconsideration.
Thompson said the draft legislation addresses a 1991 attorney general’s opinion that stated the Legislature could not act on a governor’s veto after lawmakers adjourn because the Legislature was no longer in possession of the bill. 
North Dakota lawmakers weigh new legislation after governor veto confusion

The committee approved the bill draft unanimously. 
In August, the committee advanced a different bill draft that lawmakers say will prevent conflicts over interpreting a governor’s veto.
The issue arose last May after Armstrong indicated in a veto message he was vetoing $150,000 for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in the bill markup. 
That led to a disagreement involving the state’s legislative and executive branches over how to interpret the line-item veto.
The draft legislation indicates that when a governor’s line-item veto message and bill markup conflict, the markup would take precedence over the governor’s message. That’s in contrast to Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s recent opinion that said bill markups are visual images and should not change the substance of a veto.
Both bills drafts will be considered for advancement to the 2027 legislative session by Legislative Management.
The state dollars that were the subject of the veto confusion, $34.85 million, were dispersed to the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency on July 1.

“Students are choosing NDSU because they see a future in North Dakota,” NDSU President David Cook said in a statement. 
Minot State University President Steve Shirley, in a Tuesday presentation to the State Board of Higher Education, said that while headcount at the school is flat, there is a 3% increase in full-time equivalent students that he said reflects a “nice little bump” in freshman enrollment — about a 15% increase.
“We’re excited about that,” he said.
Dickinson State University was the only school to show an enrollment decline, down 3%. 
Dakota College at Bottineau had 3% enrollment growth. Lake Region State College and Valley City State University each reported 1% increases. 
Enrollment trends are expected to be discussed Wednesday during a legislative committee meeting.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)WURTLAND  — Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie says he will soon have the 218 signatures needed to force a U.S. House vote on releasing federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein.
Massie, who has led the crusade to release the files much to the ire of Republican President Donald Trump, spoke about his discharge petition during a community forum in rural northeastern Kentucky. He said the results of the special House election in Arizona Tuesday night ensure the petition will receive support from the required number of U.S. House members.
“Both of the candidates on the ballot promised to sign my discharge petition,” Massie said. “And one of them won, obviously, and so now we’re going to have 218 signatures, and we’re going to force a vote on releasing those files.”
The winner of the special election was Democratic candidate Adelita Grijalva.
Earlier this month, Massie appeared with victims of Epstein who supported the release of the files. 
House Republican leaders oppose Massie’s efforts and are backing an investigation by the House Oversight Committee, which is chaired by another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. James Comer.
Massie told reporters after the forum that D.C. leaders are “in full panic” following the election. He also added that they politically “threatened” Republican co-signers of the petition.

If Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson tries to use “some special parliamentary procedure” to stall the petition, Massie said it also would require 218 votes. 
“And if you participate in that vote to sideline the discharge petition, now you’re part of the coverup. So, they’re going to have a vote. I think they’re coming to terms with that,” Massie said.
He added: “And I’m going to bet the speaker is probably going to hand out hall passes to some congressmen, because this is an 80-20 issue. He may be advising some of the members of the Republican Party to vote for my discharge petition.”
Epstein’s death in federal custody in 2019 was ruled a suicide, although many Trump supporters have speculated that he was murdered to keep him from revealing embarrassing information about prominent people. Trump fueled speculation about Epstein’s death during his 2020 campaign. In 2024, Trump said he would declassify the Epstein records if returned to the presidency.
Trump has previously vowed to find a candidate to oust Massie in the Republican primary for Kentucky 4th Congressional District. The area has become a stronghold for Republicans who back Massie, but has also voted for Trump in presidential elections. 
Massie appeared at the Greenup County stop with Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. The two are traveling the district Wednesday and Thursday for a mix of official and campaign events. 
Paul told reporters that some members of Congress may vote to object to changing the rules, not just on the petition. 
“So, I think you actually might get even more of a groundswell if he tries to turn off the discharge petition,” Paul said of possible efforts by House Speaker Johnson.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5239-1024x811.jpg,,,2025-09-24 10:58:25.078250

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine filed a class action lawsuit on Monday challenging the denial of bond hearings to people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
This lawsuit comes after a federal judge ruled on Sept. 19 in favor of a man unlawfully detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Maine. The ACLU of Maine had filed a habeas petition on behalf of the man, who is the organization’s client.  
Now, the ACLU of Maine is seeking relief for others in similar situations.
“Indefinitely detaining people and separating them from their families, communities, and jobs is not only cruel – it’s against the law,” Max Brooks, an immigration attorney with the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement Tuesday. “Millions of people who have been waiting for their day in court are now at risk of being jailed indefinitely over civil violations.”
The recent ruling 
While a preliminary victory, the federal court for the District of Maine ruling in Petitioner v. Stamper et. al. on Sept. 19 indicates that this man’s, and perhaps others’, claims could eventually prevail in court. 
The court granted the ACLU of Maine’s request for emergency relief, therefore blocking the federal government from transferring the man out of Maine. But the judge also concluded that he is likely to prevail on his claims that his due process rights were violated.
According to the ACLU, the man was transported over 200 miles and detained in Fort Fairfield after local police arrested him near Waterville and transferred him into CBP custody. He was denied contact with his family or legal counsel for nine days, according to the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit alleges CBP violated his due process rights by denying him the opportunity for a bond hearing, as required under federal law.
The new case
The class action lawsuit, Orellana v. Moriz, similarly alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice has misclassified people arrested by ICE and denied those people of their right to a bond hearing.
Attorneys blocked from routine ICE check-ins in Maine, Pingree says

Along with the ACLU of Maine, the ACLU of Massachusetts, ACLU of New Hampshire, law firm Araujo and Fisher, law firm Foley Hoag and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 
These groups argue the federal government’s recent actions have upended decades of settled law and established practice in immigration proceedings. District courts in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York have already concluded such violations in similar cases. 
The lawsuit cites federal statute that stipulates people arrested inside the U.S. while their immigration cases proceed are entitled to bond hearings before an immigration judge unless they are deemed a threat to public safety or a flight risk. 
In 2022, however, the immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, began misclassifying people in that scenario as “mandatory detainees” under another statute, which covers people stopped at the border or ports of entry who can be held without bond hearings.
In April, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled that this practice was likely illegal and ordered a bond hearing for a wrongfully detained litigant. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started asking immigration judges to deny bond hearings in July 2025. Earlier this month, the Board of Immigration Appeals, a Justice Department body that reviews immigration court decisions, issued a precedential decision that made that new policy binding on all immigration decisions.  
“This statute has never been applied to people arrested in the interior of the United States and placed in removal proceedings, and this practice blatantly goes against its plain language,” Brooks said in a statement. “However, CBP and ICE have begun indefinitely jailing people who are undergoing civil immigration proceedings that can take months or years. This is a clear violation of the due process rights of immigrants as outlined by federal law.”

The two teams play again Saturday at Oxford. Both are undefeated. Both have looked like FBS playoff teams. LSU is ranked No. 4, and Ole Miss is ranked No. 13. Surprisingly, at least to this column, Ole Miss is favored, albeit by the slimmest of margins.

I have covered probably 30 Ole Miss-LSU games in person, but my introduction to the rivalry was not in person or even on TV. No, it came on Halloween night, 66 years ago. LSU was ranked No. 1, Ole Miss No. 3. My father and I listened to the radio at our kitchen table with a yellow formica top on 26th Avenue in Hattiesburg. Our beige Philco radio was tuned to 870 AM, WWL in New Orleans. As was usually was the case at night, WWL came in loud and clear. LSU broadcaster J.C. Politz was on the call.
Ole Miss led 3-0 when Jake Gibbs punted late in the fourth quarter. We heard Politz say Billy Cannon gathered in the punt on a bounce at his own 11-yard line. We heard Politz say Cannon stumbled momentarily at the 20. And then, we couldn’t hear anything Politz said. All we could hear was the roar of the crowd. But, even at age 7, I knew what was happening.
The rest is college football lore. Cannon broke several tackles en route to an 89-yard touchdown. It won the game for LSU and the Heisman Trophy for Cannon. It cost the greatest football team in Mississippi history the outright national championship. Ole Miss absolutely dominated the game, except on the scoreboard. The Rebels gained 19 first downs and 363 yards to six first downs and 74 yards total for LSU. In a Sugar Bowl rematch, Ole Miss hammered LSU 21-0. If not for Cannon’s punt return, that Ole Miss team probably would be remembered as the greatest college football team of all time. Those Rebels outscored 11 opponents, including mighty LSU twice, 349-21
Fifty-four years later, in 2013, Cannon and his LSU coach, Paul Dietzel, attended a meeting of the Jackson Touchdown Club. Also in attendance were several of the ’59 Ole Miss Rebels. Beforehand, Cannon and Dietzel posed for a Clarion Ledger photographer while the former Ole Miss players stood off to the side and watched. And then Marvin Terrell, the biggest and strongest of all the ’59 Rebels, brought down the house when he bellowed, “Hey Billy, come try to run through us now.”
Wisely, Cannon declined.

The LSU-Ole Miss series has provided so many more poignant memories, though few with the national ramifications of that ’59 game. The last three Ole Miss-LSU games have ended with the home crowd storming the field The last two meetings have been especially memorable.
Two years ago at Oxford, Ole Miss overcame a 42-34 fourth quarter deficit to win 55-49 in a duel of fantastic quarterbacks Jayden Daniels and Jaxson Dart. As of today, both Daniels and Dart are starting NFL quarterbacks. Last year, at Baton Rouge, Garrett Nussmeier rallied No. 13 LSU to a 29-26 overtime victory over Dart and the No. 9 Rebels. My guess: Nussmeier, as well, will one day start at quarterback in the NFL.
My most memorable in-person Ole Miss-LSU game? There have been so many, but I’d have to go with the 1997 meeting when unranked Ole Miss stunned No. 8 LSU 36-21 behind a heroic performance from previously unsung quarterback Stewart Patridge. Remember?
If you were there at Tiger Stadium that sunny, breezy afternoon, you haven’t forgotten. A week earlier, LSU had knocked No. 1 and undefeated Florida, coached by Steve Spurrier. Ole Miss had lost two of its first five games by double digits. There was nothing to suggest heavily favored LSU wouldn’t wipe the field with Tommy Tuberville’s Rebels, still reeling from NCAA probation and with only 68 players on scholarship.
Patridge, who would win the Conerly Trophy that season, had transferred to Ole Miss from Mississippi Delta Junior College and had not become the Rebels’ starter until late in his junior season. But that October afternoon in Baton Rouge, Patridge was remarkable. Checking off about every other play against the constantly blitzing LSU defense, Patridge, both resourceful and accurate, threw for 346 yards and two touchdowns. He picked LSU apart is what he did. Time and time again, he hit key third down passes to extend drives and keep the Tigers’ offense off the field.
By game’s end, much of the LSU crowd had exited. In the southeast corner of the Tiger Stadium end zone, about 3,000 Ole Miss had-to-be-hoarse fans stayed and Hotty Toddied long, long after the final horn sounded.

As we boost supply, how can we ensure it reaches everyone?","Too many Californians are struggling: in a recent survey we conducted at UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab, 71% of voters say it’s difficult to find housing within their price range, while nearly half struggle to find good local jobs (45%), low-cost healthy food (47%), or affordable eldercare (59%).
Despite the tremendous resources available, and California’s standing as the fourth largest economy in the world, our state has a scarcity problem. Whether we’re talking about housing, well-paying jobs, childcare or eldercare, it feels to many like there just isn’t enough to go around. 

Read the Brief: Californians’ Experiences Accessing Basic Resources
One potential solution generating considerable buzz is the Abundance Agenda, with the core belief that if we can just increase the overall supply of everything – housing, clean energy, education – then everyone is automatically going to be better off. And not just building more, but building faster by removing the bureaucratic barriers and red tape that slow projects down. It’s a “rising tide lifts all boats” approach.
Abundance cannot only be about producing more; it must be about producing better, together.
While this emphasis on speed and efficiency sounds appealing, our research suggests that implementation reveals a crucial blindspot. The real challenge isn’t whether to build more—it’s ensuring that the increased supply of essential goods and services actually improves life for the maximum number of Californians. To achieve these goals, we need a new model of people-centered policymaking.


Read the Report: People-Centered Abundance Framework
Through this research series, we’ll explore the critical yet missing component in this vision of abundance: the people who will make it possible.

Working with communities to design solutions that work for them, in the places they live 
Working with labor, including streamlining opportunities and creating incentives for essential job training
And working with the people in government who will help deliver goods and services that benefit us all.

While Californians urgently need a future with access to the essentials for a quality life, we cannot ignore the questions of who builds this future and who benefits from it. Sustainable abundance requires not only removing barriers to building, but actively creating pathways for communities to participate in, and benefit from, that growth.
We believe building fast can be coupled with building fair, and our research explores how to make this possible.
In this research series, we’ll describe data that explores the tradeoffs inherent in balancing ‘building fast’ with ‘building fair’ across the care economy, labor and workforce, and the built infrastructure. We’ll offer new research on how communities can provide input while keeping processes moving forward, and shifting influence away from special interests towards the social good. We’ll consider the types of partnerships, policies, and perspectives that can advance these goals. And, finally, we’ll offer a starting point for evidence-based and community-informed policy reforms that enable us to ‘build more’ in ways that allow all Californians to share in the state’s abundant resources.
The stakes are high. Housing costs continue to outpace wages across the state, and one in five Californians can’t afford to put food on their table. 
Without intentional action, new policies could simply reproduce existing inequalities at a larger scale. But done well, California’s push for reforms could become a model for how we can meet people’s basic needs while expanding opportunity for everyone. 
The path forward requires acknowledging that true abundance isn’t just about quantity; it’s about creating systems that work for all Californians: across rural and urban communities, across economic sectors, across private and public entities. Only then will the rising tide truly lift all boats.

Mike Dunleavy discusses his new proposed omnibus education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Monday vetoed Senate Bill 54, a bill that sought to extend and expand the duties of the State Board of Registration for Architects, Engineers and Land Surveyors, including licensing interior designers.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage and the bill’s sponsor, said he learned of the veto Tuesday and said it could come up for a possible override vote in January, when lawmakers convene for the regular session.
As written, SB 54 would have allowed interior designers to register with the board, enabling their work on large, public-use projects to be submitted to permitting agencies without an engineering review. 
In his veto message, the governor said the bill does not define “interior design,” and said “there is no public safety rationale for creating a new title and bureaucracy. The expansion increases cost and confusion without a demonstrated benefit.”
Claman said the bill deliberately left the definition of “interior design” to the board as part of a legislative compromise.
The governor also offered two other reasons for his veto, saying that one section could eliminate the state’s ability to select contractors on price, and that another section could require residential wastewater work to be done by licensed professional engineers, increasing costs for housing.
Claman said the governor’s reasoning appears to be based on different legal interpretations than ones he relied upon when drafting the bill.
“Obviously, I was very disappointed,” he said of the governor’s veto. “I can’t say I was expecting it, but I just wasn’t sure where the governor was.”
The governor’s veto of SB 54 is his eighth veto of a policy bill so far this year. Two of those vetoes have been overridden. While the number of vetoes is low in absolute terms, it represents a record-high percentage of vetoed bills. 
Lawmakers passed 33 bills through both House and Senate this year, meaning the governor has vetoed almost a quarter of all passed bills. No other governor has come close to that veto rate.
One bill remains pending on the governor’s desk. That’s Senate Bill 113, which would boost vocational-technical education and student reading programs with proceeds from a revised state corporate income tax. 
The governor has previously expressed skepticism of the bill, and at a news conference in May, he implied he would veto it. That was before lawmakers overrode his veto of a separate bill that allocates funding from SB 113 to education projects. 
Dunleavy has until Oct. 1 to decide whether to veto it, sign it, or allow it to become law without signature.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents approved a proposal from Kansas State University to work with Cowley County Community College to offer an associate degree in milling science after opposition from community and technical colleges threatened to derail the initiative.
Kansas State administrators sought permission to make use of its extensive milling science infrastructure and faculty to develop their own 60 credit-hour degree in the subject. The idea of an online alternative to K-State’s 120-credit program — the only bachelor’s degree in milling science in the United States — was endorsed by Cargill, Seaboard Foods, Hill’s Pet Nutrition and several trade associations.
“The proposal reflects our land-grant mission,” said Jesse Perez Mendez, the provost at K-State. “The demand for skilled professionals in supervisory, operational and technical roles in milling, baking, feed and pet food is significant.”
However, Kansas’ two-year community and technical colleges raised objections to the original proposal by K-State to invade their academic domain by single-handedly launching an associate degree.
“The community and technical college’s mission is squarely in the area that K-State is trying to stray,” said Heather Morgan, executive director of the Kansas Association of Community Colleges. “This situation will impact the trust between the colleges and K-State in future potential partnerships.”
Samantha Christy-Dangermond, chair of the Kansas Postsecondary Technical Education Board, likewise challenged K-State’s proposal for its associate degree in milling. She pointed to Board of Regents policy discouraging state universities from offering associate degrees in academic or technical programs where a baccalaureate existed. K-State offers four bachelor’s degrees in grain science and industry, she said.
Subsequently, K-State put together a cooperative agreement with Cowley County Community College to jointly offer the associate degree. Under the arrangement, Cowley County students would be able to apply certificate credits toward the associate degree at K-State.
It was enough to convince the Board of Regents last week to endorse the academic program.
“I think the collaboration is very important,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents. “It strengthens your program and certainly strengthens the ability of students to be able to have a seamless path, and also helps business and industry.”
The curriculum would accommodate industry professionals seeking to earn a degree online while maintaining their job and would serve traditional students aiming to complete a two-year technical degree before entering the food manufacturing or grain processing workforce.
A collection of agriculture companies and lobbying organizations offered support for K-State’s campaign to create the associate degree in Kansas.
“By offering this targeted training, current and future employees will be able to bring expertise to mills throughout Kansas, reflective of the state’s position as a grain production leader,” said Nicholas Rozzi, vice president of product development at Hill’s Pet Nutrition in Topeka.
Not every supervisory or management position at food and feed production facilities required the traditional four-year college degree, said Scott Eilert, a vice president at Cargill Protein and Salt.
He said an online associate degree would better fit the life circumstance of milling employees unable to devote themselves to a degree program that could take four years or more to finish.
Jane DeMarchi, president of the North American Millers’ Association, said the organization supported the existing four-year milling degree at K-State but was convinced the secondary credential would add to the employee pipeline for companies processing wheat, corn, oats or rye into flour.
“Our hope is that current working employees will be able to advance their careers by earning an AAS degree while working full-time,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mullinville-elevator-on-us54-copy-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-24 09:58:04.122682

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California homeowners who fireproof their homes would get guaranteed insurance coverage under a ballot measure filed this week by Consumer Watchdog.
The consumer advocacy group filed the initiative in response to a competing measure that seeks to repeal Proposition 103, which Watchdog’s founder wrote in the late 1980s and now governs property insurance in the state. If the repeal effort filed by an independent insurance agent in August moves forward, Consumer Watchdog will charge ahead as well.

Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog president: “If she goes, we go. If we get flooded with donations, we may go anyway.”

Any initiative for the 2026 ballot needs more than 500,000 signatures, which can be costly to collect.
Under the measure, insurers that refuse to sell policies to property owners who meet fire mitigation guidelines would be barred from the home and auto insurance market in California for five years — which could affect availability. It would also require insurers to tell homeowners why their policies aren’t getting renewed, and give them time to make improvements. 
Court said his group may push for the policyholder “bill of rights” anyway, depending on timing and funding.
More on insurance: Levi also reports on new rules California’s insurance chief Ricardo Lara is proposing for reviewing insurance rates. Some of the rules include imposing new timelines and guidelines for intervenors (a member of the public, including Consumer Watchdog, who can challenge an insurer’s rate request), and stricter requirements for intervenors to get compensated for their work.
Lara says his proposals aim to make the rate-review process more efficient. But Consumer Watchdog argues the rules are in retaliation against the group — making it harder for it and other consumer advocacy organizations to be compensated when they challenge rates. It could also result in premium rates rising at a faster pace.

Newsom helps cannabis industry

After more than two months since an excise tax on legal cannabis increased, Gov. Gavin Newsom handed the cannabis industry a win Monday, signing into law a measure to roll back that tax, writes CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan.
The excise tax is paid by marijuana companies and imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied. The new law suspends a 19% increase that was initially instituted in July, and temporarily reverts the excise tax to 15% until 2028. The move aims to help the beleaguered cannabis industry, which proponents say are operating under slim margins and slumping sales.

Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat and bill author, in a statement: “California’s cannabis economy can bring enormous benefits to our state, but only if our legal industry is given a fair chance to compete against the untaxed and unregulated illegal market.”

Nonprofits that receive grants through the tax, however, argued that the bill would threaten services for low-income children, substance abuse programs and more.

CA makes progress on homelessness, but faces funding cuts

Homelessness rates are decreasing in some California counties, but cuts in funding could soon undo this progress, say experts and advocates.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, of the 29 places in California that conducted a point-in-time count at the start of the year, more than half reported a decrease in their homelessness populations compared to 2024. 
Keeping in mind that point-in-time counts are imperfect, rough estimates of homelessness populations, Contra Costa and Sonoma counties reported a drop in their populations by a quarter; and San Diego and Los Angeles counties each saw a decrease of less than 10%.
But in a tough budget year, organizations are bracing for cuts to homelessness funding from the state and some local jurisdictions. President Donald Trump’s administration this month also imposed new criteria that block some organizations, including those in California, from accessing $75 million in federal homeless housing funds.
Organizations are already feeling the cuts: L.A. County’s Union Station Homeless Services denied more than 700 families who needed housing from December through July. Downtown Streets Team, which has helped unhoused people in California for more than two decades, also plans to close next month.

Minneapolis parents spent nearly $700 on back-to-school shopping this year, which is well above the national average. For many families, that number represents a real strain. 
And yet, even those sacrifices don’t guarantee that students return to well-equipped classrooms.
I recently shared a video on social media of an empty classroom waiting for a brand-new teacher. The image was stark: upside-down desks and chairs in a blank white room — nothing to suggest young children would soon be asked to learn, grow and thrive there. The video went viral. Thousands of parents, educators and even a few celebrities weighed in. 
The conversation brought into focus a hard truth: In Minneapolis, especially on the Northside, new teachers are disproportionately concentrated in schools already facing the steepest challenges, and those schools are also lacking critical resources.
Every August, I count myself lucky to join educators as they prepare classrooms for the year ahead. Together, we hang colorful posters, create cozy reading corners, and transform bare rooms into welcoming spaces. 
But I also see the toll. Teachers pour enormous time, energy and money into creating these environments, often from their own pockets. Most spend years curating libraries, scouring thrift shops, or asking friends and family to chip in.
So what happens when a school hosts multiple brand-new educators year after year? 
Who equips classrooms that start the year without an assigned teacher? 
Who provides resources at schools without PTAs that routinely give teachers hundreds of dollars to spend however they see fit?
Some argue this is the responsibility of parents, not schools or teachers. But that argument falls apart in practice. Families in under-resourced schools are already stretched thin. Expecting parents to fund classrooms out of pocket simply entrenches inequity. 
In wealthier neighborhoods, families may be able to provide that support, but tying the quality of a child’s education to their zip code or household income is the very definition of injustice.
And let’s be clear: This is not accidental. It is a pattern that has persisted for far too long. Year after year, families at schools made up of predominately Black, Indigenous, and other students of color send their children to classrooms with the newest educators in the district, the most staff vacancies, and the fewest resources. 
Veteran teachers remain clustered elsewhere. 
Ask most Minneapolis Public School teachers where they started their careers, and they’re likely to name a Northside school.
The consequences are predictable. Students who already face opportunity gaps are less likely to benefit from seasoned educators who know how to differentiate instruction. Meanwhile, wealthier, whiter neighborhoods begin each year with stability and continuity.
New teachers are not the problem. They bring energy, creativity and commitment. Every educator is new at some point. But they deserve the chance to grow alongside veteran colleagues, not to shoulder entire classrooms on their own. And no set of schools or students should serve as de facto training grounds for early-career educators.
Every child deserves access to the highest-quality education our district can offer, led by teachers who are supported to stay and thrive. School districts that listen to students and parents know this. 
We have no shortage of solutions to incentivize stability in high-turnover schools. Bonuses, loan forgiveness, housing stipends and robust mentorship programs could make Northside schools destinations for talented teachers rather than revolving doors.
Back-to-school should be a season of hope and possibility for every student. Until we tackle this inequity head-on, too many Northside families will face the same painful cycle: new year, new teachers, bare classrooms, same systemic injustice. 
When educators prepare their classrooms each fall, they should be drawing from deep reservoirs of support and experience, not starting over from scratch.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1429749252-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

California colleges hope so,Mercy Sosa,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/09/california-propositions-higher-education-bond/,Lawmakers are considering putting a bond measure before voters in 2026 to fund billions of dollars in building repairs and student housing projects for California’s colleges and universities.,"In summary
Lawmakers are considering putting a bond measure before voters in 2026 to fund billions of dollars in building repairs and student housing projects for California’s colleges and universities.


Aging buildings, failing infrastructure, earthquake safety issues, and a severe lack of campus housing are straining California’s public higher education systems. As they face high-cost fixes, lawmakers have introduced a bond bill that ambitiously intends to fund both the modernization of academic facilities and the addition of affordable student housing throughout the state. 
The College Health and Safety Bond Act of 2026, AB 48, would start to address a growing $17 billion maintenance backlog within California’s university systems and the need for more affordable student housing in the state. The bill’s lead author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Democrat from San Diego, said it likely won’t include a dollar amount for the bond until it goes to the Senate next year to give the three public higher education systems in California time to report how much they need and a plan for spending it. If passed by the state Legislature, the bond would be placed on the November 2026 ballot for voters to decide. 
If an education bond measure sounds familiar, here is why: In the November 2024 general election, Californians passed Proposition 2, which authorized $8.5 million in bonds for public K-12 schools and $1.5 billion for community colleges. Although lawmakers originally included the University of California and Cal State systems in the measure, they were later excluded to cap the total bond amount at $10 billion.
System leaders at the UC and Cal State were disappointed that they were removed from Proposition 2, according to previous reporting by CalMatters. The last time Cal State and UC benefited from a bond measure was in 2006, when both systems shared $3.1 billion for facility repairs and upgrades. Those funds were exhausted by 2012. 
University buildings are in bad shape
A 2025 report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office shows that public higher education facilities are aging, campuses have growing maintenance needs, and their conditions are generally poor. 
The backlog of repairs needed for the system’s facilities, known as deferred maintenance, has led to such issues as extreme indoor heat, outdated roofs and electrical problems. Since 2015, the state has provided deferred maintenance funding of just $689 million for UC, $784 million for Cal State, and an estimated $904 million for community colleges, according to the report. 
However, CalMatters’ reporting found the UC and Cal State systems would need around $9 billion each to address their deferred maintenance needs. Community colleges have nearly $2.2 billion in maintenance needs in their current five-year plan, according to Chris Ferguson, the executive vice chancellor overseeing the finance and facilities division.
Some of the bond bill’s objectives are to prioritize safety issues and seismic deficiencies. Roughly 30% of UC and Cal State buildings and 20% of community college buildings were constructed before 1970.  
According to the Cal State system’s current five-year plan, priority projects include replacing Peterson Hall 1 at Cal State Long Beach, which currently houses health sciences and is on the priority list for not meeting California’s building codes for earthquake safety. The building would consolidate other programs and replace two faculty office buildings from the 1950s, according to Paul Gannoe, an assistant vice chancellor in Cal State’s business and finance division.
Cal State also plans to replace Sacramento State’s engineering building, Santa Clara Hall. The infrastructure of the building, built in the 1960s, has exceeded its useful life, according to Cal State’s previous five-year plan.

UC Berkeley, which opened in 1868, reports its highest priority for new funding is to add an academic building to house mathematics, economics, and other departments, moving them out of seismically unfit spaces. The campus also has plans for three future student housing projects.
At UC Davis, a $68 million improvement plan for the 86-year-old Hickey Gymnasium Building is on the unfunded priority list. One faculty member there, Carolynn Patten, has had to halt her stroke research due to rats chewing on cables and the extreme indoor heat compromising her equipment, she previously told CalMatters.
Although community colleges already are receiving funding for facilities from Proposition 2, Assemblymember Alvarez said they are included in this new bill because their needs are still significant and they are important to the entire ecosystem of higher education.
“In order to maintain our competitiveness as a state, we need to make sure we’re always investing in education, and we need to have the right facilities to do so,” Alvarez said. “A very large percentage of our buildings and our universities and colleges are outdated, and technology has advanced, and so we make sure we have the right types of learning environments.”
Student housing needs are also on the rise
Despite California’s generous financial aid programs, Kevin Cook from the Public Policy Institute of California said that due to the high cost of living in the state, trying to house students is an increasingly expensive task.
The average housing cost for independent students ranges from $1,400 to $1,520 per month, according to the California Student Aid Commission’s 2023 Food and Housing Survey, which surveyed students who applied for financial aid for the 2022-23 academic year. The same survey found that 53% of student respondents experienced housing insecurity.
A separate 2020 study by the Center for the Transformation of Schools at UCLA found that about 1 in 5 community college students, 1 in 10 Cal State students, and 1 in 20 UC students experience homelessness. Although the Legislative Analyst’s Office warns of limitations on both of these surveys, it does point out the noteworthiness of the number of students experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness.
The location of a campus can greatly impact student housing costs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the average off-campus rent for two-bedroom apartments near UC Merced was $1,465 per month in 2024, while for UC Santa Cruz it was $4,297 per month.

For Cal State students, the average rent per month for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,807 near Cal State Bakersfield, while the average is $3,014 per month near San Francisco State.
Aditi Hariharan, president of the UC Student Association, said the bond bill aligns with the association’s priorities, though they have not yet taken an official vote on whether to support the bill.
“Students are constantly struggling to stay in university and be enrolled, find housing, and that’s a significant cost of living barrier,” Hariharan said.
Chris Chandler, vice president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, said his association supports the bill because they understand how important housing is for their student body. Chandler is studying business administration at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, where students struggle to find affordable housing. 
“You might hear students say, ‘Well, you know, I’m couch surfing with a friend’, or, ‘I’m about that van life’ and things like that,” Chandler said. “But you know, if we’re being really fair, those are homeless students, and they’re just looking for alternatives, to find a place where they can lay their head at night.” 
Southwestern College does not offer on-campus housing to its students. However, 14 out of 116 California Community Colleges do. The proposed bond funding would help community colleges continue to develop affordable housing for students. 
Facilities funding has evolved for universities
Traditionally, funding for university facilities has come from two sources: The state budget, for funding academic buildings such as classrooms, labs and faculty offices, and fees charged by the universities for self-supported facilities, such as housing, parking and campus dining.
In 2013 and 2014, in an effort to reduce state debt, then-Gov. Jerry Brown gave the UC and Cal State systems the authority to issue their own bonds. The university systems began selling revenue bonds to fund facility projects. 
For revenue-generating projects such as student housing, universities use the proceeds from the bond as well as fees and rent paid by students to repay the bond and interest, said Robert Eaton, an assistant vice chancellor in Cal State’s business and finance division.
Academic facilities, such as a science building, do not generate revenue and have to be repaid through the system’s central budget. While Cal State trustees have the ability to set aside funds to service debt, they haven’t done so since 2018 due to an inadequate budget, Eaton said.

About five years ago, as housing and construction costs were sharply increasing, the state decided to start putting money toward affordable student housing. In 2021, the state Legislature approved allocating $2 billion over three years to public colleges and universities for the construction and renovation of student housing through the Higher Education Student Housing Grant. Gov. Gavin Newsom then took back that funding in 2023 to help close a state budget deficit, with the state instead agreeing to pay the principal and interest on bonds the colleges and universities issued themselves. That saved projects already in the works, but the state’s community colleges and public university systems still have many more student housing plans in need of funding.
A statewide bond that would fund both academic facilities and affordable student housing would address both deficits troubling California’s public higher education systems. However, the inclusion of student housing in the bond bill is “a big departure from historic state practice, and it’s raising a new tension with how to deal with academic facilities and improving the condition of those facilities, while also addressing student and faculty housing needs,” said Jennifer Pacella of the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
Would a bond have a chance with California voters?
According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office report, voters approve most state bonds for higher education facilities. From 1986 to 2016, voters approved 10 out of 12 state bond measures that benefited higher education. The only higher education bond measure to fail in the past 30 years was in 2020, when voters rejected Proposition 13, a $15 billion bond measure for K-12 schools, community colleges and universities. 
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association opposed that bond, and now opposes the new bill’s proposal. Susan Shelley, a spokesperson for the association, says that she looks at it from the perspective of the taxpayers who will be paying for the interest rate of the bond.
“Every couple of years, there’s a request for another bond to be added on top of that,” Shelley said. “We want to make sure that bonds are always funding something that will still be giving value to the people who are paying for it 30 years from now, and that it’s not just being used for current expenses or maintenance expenses or anything that won’t give value to the people who have to pay for it.”
Darien Shanske, professor of law at UC Davis, argues that the state subsidizing the cost of public education is a good investment. Although a state bond initiative would need public polling to determine its ability to pass, “there seems to be a fair amount of support for public higher education,” Shanske said. 
An August 2025 poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies shows that out of 6,474 registered California voters who responded, 58% believe state funding should be increased for the UC system.

Stanford Chatfield
Stanford Chatfield is an historical interpreter at Alcatraz for the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. He was incarcerated 35 years.


At 69 years old, I wake up every morning excited to go to work as an historical interpreter at Alcatraz. I leave home each day with a huge smile on my face, knowing I’ll meet people from around the world and share the complex history of this island. 
It’s meaningful work that values my perspective — including the 35 years I spent behind bars in a state penitentiary.
Though I’ve made progress since my release last year from the Correctional Training Facility in Monterey County, I’ve fallen far behind others my age. My peers have built retirement savings and Social Security credits during their prime earning years, while I was working in prison making 28 cents an hour.
While I served time, I worked as a college enrollment clerk, coordinating and organizing course materials for incarcerated students and staff. I loved the work. The pay? Not so much. When I was released, I was broke and bewildered.
California’s reentry system, like its incarceration system, is broken. The state invests too little in inmates — paying them pennies for their work — and not enough in effective programs that help them reenter society. 
In one year the state spends a staggering $133,000 to incarcerate one person — more than twice the University of Southern California’s tuition. Though about 40,000 people come home from prison each year, nearly half end up back behind bars within three years. 
This endless cycle drains taxpayer resources without improving public safety.
While incarcerated, I was one of the top earners; many guys there were making just 8 cents an hour. They should be paid at least minimum wage and be given opportunities for advancement. 
When I got out, I could have easily fallen through the cracks. For the longest time I didn’t know what my purpose was, but I made a commitment to honesty and integrity in all my affairs.
I’m starting over with a decades-old criminal record. The odds weren’t in my favor — until Creating Restorative Opportunities and Programs, or CROP, accepted me into Ready 4 Life, a year-long fellowship. It offered me job training and dignity. I developed technical skills and a positive mindset. 
About 95% of CROP participants don’t reoffend. Yet CROP’s future is uncertain. Given the ups and downs of the state budget, programs like CROP don’t always get steady investment.
I chose to train in UX (user experience) design for developing websites and computer apps, because technology had passed me by during my incarcerated years. Just learning those digital foundations opened doors I never imagined, even for my Alcatraz job.

The program’s real value came from the connections I made, including some formerly incarcerated individuals who had succeeded and some business leaders. 
When CROP’s employment specialist found a job posting for an assistant tour guide at Alcatraz, I took a leap of faith. In my cover letter, I wrote: “I’m a formerly incarcerated individual, and I believe I can bring a unique and valuable perspective to this position.”
It worked. During my interview on a rainy day, they told me to explore the island while they decided. My phone rang an hour later. “Are you still here? We want you,” they said.
I knew my life had truly changed. What started as seasonal work became permanent. Now I interpret Alcatraz’s history and support myself on about $25 an hour, and my experience gives me credibility that can’t be taught.
Thanks to CROP and employers willing to see beyond my record, I’m doing meaningful work that values my whole story. That’s what the dignity of work should look like for everyone coming home.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/072623_San-Quentin_SN_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

California’s insurance commissioner has sparred with Consumer Watchdog, which says his proposed rule is retaliatory.


California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is proposing more new insurance rules that critics are calling “vindictive,” and which they say will only make it easier for insurers to raise rates.
Home insurance costs in California are certain to rise in the near future because of Lara’s recent changes to the state’s insurance rules. Those changes are meant to encourage insurance companies to keep writing new policies and discourage them from canceling policies, especially in areas of high wildfire risk. 
Last week, Lara proposed altering the insurance rate-review process in what he said is an effort to make it more efficient. But others say the changes Lara wants to make amount to retaliation against one of his biggest and toughest critics, Consumer Watchdog.
“This is Trumpian,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, the nonprofit organization that wrote the state’s Proposition 103 insurance law. Consumer Watchdog is California’s most prolific intervenor; an intervenor is a member of the public who can challenge an insurer’s rate request. 
The organization has repeatedly questioned Lara’s ties to the insurance industry, from which he has received and returned campaign contributions. Consumer Watchdog has sued the insurance department over several different issues, including its rule allowing the FAIR Plan — the fire insurance provider of last resort — to recoup some of its claims payouts from policyholders in the state. 
Lara’s proposed changes would do the following: 

Impose new timelines and guidelines for intervenors and administrative law judges.
Tighten requirements for what’s considered a “substantial contribution” for intervenors to get compensated for their work.
Limit administrative law judges’ authority in rate reviews.

Consumer Watchdog and other consumer advocacy organizations say those changes would make it harder for intervenors — who need to pay experts to challenge the rate requests — to be compensated. That could result in fewer intervenors, not more, as Lara’s proposal intends. They also say the changes could lead to unjustified premium increases more quickly.
Lara’s term expires next year and “he’s exacting his revenge,” Court told CalMatters, adding that his group is considering suing over the matter. 
Michael Soller, a spokesperson for the insurance department, would not respond to Court’s comments but said Consumer Watchdog “will have a chance to say what they have to say” during the public comment period on Lara’s proposal, which starts Oct. 3. A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Nov. 20. 
An insurance industry representative, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, supports Lara’s proposal to fix the “broken intervenor process.”
“The only one of its kind in the nation, this process has contributed to the insurance crisis by delaying rate approvals, duplicating the (insurance department’s) work, and ultimately driving up costs for consumers,” said Denni Ritter, the association’s vice president for state government relations, in a statement.
Both Lara and the insurance industry have questioned Consumer Watchdog’s commitment to consumers over the years, and have accused the group of using the insurance law it wrote to enrich its leaders.
But Consumer Watchdog says it has saved Californians more than $6 billion in home and auto insurance premiums from 2002 to 2024. Under the intervenor system, the group says it has received $14.2 million in compensation over that period, or 25 cents for every $100 saved. Court said that compensation goes toward paying attorneys and actuaries — experts who try to hold their own against the powerful insurance industry.
California, whose housing costs are the highest in the nation, is about in the middle when it comes to average annual homeowners’ insurance rates, according to analyses by Realtor.com and comparison website Bankrate.com. Like many other states around the country, though, it is dealing with climate change-related risks that have raised concerns about an uninsurable future.
Robert Herrell is executive director of Consumer Federation of California, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that mostly focuses on legislative work but which has also intervened in rate reviews. He said he doesn’t agree with Consumer Watchdog on everything, but that intervenors’ work in the state has been important in keeping insurance premiums from rising too much. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind that the work Consumer Watchdog has done has saved consumers money,” said Herrell, who was deputy insurance commissioner under former Commissioner Dave Jones.
Both groups sued Lara in July, alleging he denied them compensation for their participation in the department’s rulemaking last year. 
Herrell said stricter requirements for intervenors will only serve to discourage them from challenging rate requests and lead to higher insurance premiums, and that Lara’s proposal “feels punitive” against Consumer Watchdog.
“We (intervenors) may be collateral damage, but real people are going to get hurt,” he added.
Soller, the insurance department spokesperson, disagrees. He said the commissioner’s proposal actually seeks to increase transparency and the number of intervenors, and addresses a key problem: availability of insurance. 
Insurance companies that have pulled back on writing new policies in California have complained, among other things, that the department takes too long to approve their rate requests. 
“What consumers aren’t getting is availability and the coverage they need,” Soller said. 
Consumer Watchdog is pushing back on the accusation that it’s to blame for delays in rate approvals. “The time until rates were approved in cases with intervenors and without intervenors’ public participation is nearly identical,” the group said in a statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091924-Ricardo-Lara-FG-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

But funding cuts could derail that progress,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/09/ca-homelessness-funding-population/,"Experts worry liberal California will be blacklisted from federal homelessness dollars, effectively counteracting recent progress.","In summary
Experts worry liberal California will be blacklisted from federal homelessness dollars, effectively counteracting recent progress. 


California counties are reporting decreases in homelessness, suggesting the state is finally making progress in solving one of its most difficult and persistent problems.
But even as Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials are celebrating, the money that made those wins possible is at risk of evaporating. 
President Donald Trump’s administration this month tried to block organizations that don’t support its social agenda from accessing federal homeless housing funds — causing experts in the field to worry that politically liberal California could find itself blacklisted from crucial dollars.
Cuts to state homelessness funding are also on the horizon, and some local jurisdictions are pulling back funds as they struggle with their own budget deficits. That has counties, nonprofits and industry experts worried California’s homeless counts will soon go right back up.
“I do think that we’re doing something right,” Sharon Rapport, director of California state policy for the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said of the recent decreases. “That all may come to a crashing end with a lot of concerns with what’s happening at the federal level, federal policy changing and funding cuts happening.”
Of the 29 places in California that reported an official homeless census this year, more than half saw a decrease compared to 2024, according to an analysis of point-in-time counts by the Hub for Urban Initiatives. That includes drops of about a quarter in Contra Costa and Sonoma counties, 20% in Santa Cruz County, 16% in Ventura County and 14% in Merced County. 
San Diego and Los Angeles counties each saw a decrease of less than 10%. For LA County, this marks the second year in a row that homelessness is down.
But funding worries loom like a black cloud over those promising results. As purse strings tighten, service providers will have to cut staff, programs and bed capacity, meaning they can help fewer homeless people. For years, California cities, counties and nonprofits have been pushing the Newsom administration to provide an ongoing source of homeless funding, so service providers can plan ahead without worrying each year about how much money they’ll get.
Some organizations already are feeling the squeeze. 
From December through July, Union Station Homeless Services in Los Angeles County turned away 700 families who needed housing, said CEO Katie Hill. 
“We just don’t have anything available for them,” Hill said.
The county cut housing vouchers as the city and county struggled with financial fallout from recent wildfires, falling property tax revenues and increasing legal payouts.
Other organizations are closing their doors for good. Downtown Streets Team, which helps unhoused residents in 16 California cities find housing while earning money cleaning up local streets, plans to close next month after two decades of service. 
“The financial and political environment we operate in has shifted dramatically in recent months,” CEO Julie Gardner said in an emailed statement. “During this time, (Downtown Streets Team) lost several significant contracts and grants, creating a multi-million-dollar loss in overall funding. When combined with other factors, including rapidly rising operational costs, these losses made it impossible to continue running the organization in a financially sustainable way.”
‘I just don’t think we’re going to see that funding’
Congress in 2023 appropriated $75 million for something called the Continuum of Care Builds grant, which was supposed to help support the construction of new homeless housing. Former President Joe Biden’s administration started the application process for those grants in 2024. When Trump took the helm in 2025, his administration re-started the process with new criteria, making applicants apply again.
Then, at the start of September, the Trump administration made everyone apply a third time — with a very different set of criteria seeming to disqualify organizations that support trans clients, use “harm reduction” strategies to prevent drug overdose deaths or operate in a “sanctuary city.”
Applicants had to attest that they don’t deny the “sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic.” They had to promise not to distribute drug paraphernalia or allow the use of drugs on their property. 
“I do think that we’re doing something right. That all may come to a crashing end.”Sharon Rapport, director, California state policy for the Corporation for Supportive Housing
Applicants also had to attest that they operate in a city, county or state that cooperates with federal immigration enforcement. Newsom has resisted Trump’s immigration crackdown at a state level, and recently signed a set of bills intended to further check ICE.
And applicants were required to operate in a city, county or state that prohibits public camping and enforces that rule. That one could be an easier lift: Arrests and citations for camping-related activities have soared in some California cities over the past year, after the U.S. Supreme Court gave cities more leeway to crack down, and Newsom encouraged cities to ban camping. But two recent statewide attempts to ban homeless camps from near schools and other areas fell flat.
The new funding rules were a major blow to Contra Costa County-based Hope Solutions, which was initially selected to receive $5.5 million to build 15 tiny homes for homeless 18-24-year-olds in Pittsburg. After staff spent at least 100 hours completing the project proposal, they learned this month that they’d no longer qualify because of the new criteria. The Pittsburg Police Department says it does not participate in immigration enforcement. In addition, the new program rules specify the money must go to buildings that serve elderly residents — an about-face that takes Hope Solutions’ youth project out of the running.
“It felt like a gut punch,” said CEO Deanne Pearn, “and really disheartening to know that we had spent so much time and asked so much of our county partners and others, and that that time could have been spent elsewhere.”

Hope Solutions is still moving forward with the project, which Pearn hopes the organization can fund with its own financial reserves. But that means the nonprofit won’t have that money for its next project.
The National Alliance to End Homelessness recently sued the Trump administration over the new grant conditions, claiming that all projects in California and three dozen other states would be ineligible for funds. Earlier this month, a federal judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. 
Now, that $75 million is frozen as the case moves forward.
While the new conditions at issue in the lawsuit apply only to one specific federal homelessness grant, experts worry it’s an ominous sign for California. Service providers expect applications to open this fall for the main source of federal homelessness funding — the Continuum of Care Program — which funneled about $600 million to California counties in 2023. 
If that application poses similar requirements, California could be in trouble.
“Personally, I just don’t think we’re going to see that funding,” said Hill, of Union Station Homeless Services in Los Angeles County. 
In a separate lawsuit, San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties sued the Trump administration over contracts that prevented recipients of federal homeless funds from using the money to promote “gender ideology,” “elective abortions” and “illegal immigration.” The counties won an early victory last month, when a judge temporarily blocked the administration from imposing those conditions. 
Other federal cuts are looming, too. The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, which launched during the COVID-19 pandemic and now helps more than 15,000 Californians pay their rent, is expected to run out of money next year. 
That’s not even counting the cuts to housing vouchers and other federal housing and homelessness programs Trump proposed in May, which are still being negotiated in Congress. 
California turning a corner on homelessness
California appears to be decreasing its homeless population, according to the Hub for Urban Initiatives, a California organization that helps local communities shape their homelessness policy, apply for grants and survey their homeless populations.
The 29 California communities that counted and reported their homeless populations this year tallied a total of 131,209 people — a 4% decrease from what those same communities reported last year. That’s a significant step for a state where the homeless population has been stubbornly rising for years.
That data comes from the federally mandated homeless point-in-time count, where teams of volunteers count the unhoused people they see on the street on one night in January. The counts are imperfect, as volunteers can overlook people sleeping in out-of-the-way places, and different counties use different methods — while some places count every year, others count every other. Of the 44 “continuums of care” required to count in California (some small, rural communities combine multiple counties into one continuum of care), 14 didn’t count this year.
The federal housing department will release an official total for the state later this year.
Newsom trumpeted the initial decreases, taking credit for pouring money into homeless housing and other services. He’s not wrong. 
Contra Costa County, which saw the state’s biggest drop in homelessness this year, attributes its success largely to the recent boost in state funding, said Christy Saxton, director of Health, Housing and Homeless Services for Contra Costa County. Over the past two years, the county increased its homeless shelter and housing capacity by more than a third.
A big piece of that was the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, which Newsom launched in the 2019-20 budget year to fill what until then had been a void of state homelessness funds. For the past few years, that program gave cities and counties $1 billion each year. 
Those funds support programs such as Contra Costa County’s Delta Landing temporary housing site in Pittsburg, which opened 172 units in 2021. Until then, that part of the county had about 20 beds for its unhoused residents, Saxton said.
But instead of making that state funding ongoing, Newsom’s administration opted to dole it out in one-time grants each year, leaving cities and counties continually guessing what next year’s budget will bring. 
This year, that state program will get no new funding (because of the glacial pace at which the state distributes these funds, cities and counties have yet to receive money from the last round). Next year, the amount is set to shrink to $500 million.
“We are significantly concerned about the cuts that are coming,” Saxton said, “because it has taken an influx of money in order to see those decreases, and we need that to continue on now more than ever.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081524_Migrant-Encampment_AH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford doula training targets gaps in care for Spanish speakers,Mariana Navarrete Villegas and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/doula-training-hartford-spanish-hispanic-health-council/,The Hispanic Health Council's doula program is conducted entirely in Spanish and aims to address a maternal health gap in Hartford.,"On a Friday morning in early September, a group of women sit cross-legged facing small candles and flowers in a softly-lit birth training room in Hartford. Six of the women form a circle around a pregnant woman, who is just a month away from giving birth.
The group is there for a ceremony meant to transmit feelings of peace and safety to the mother-to-be. Zaza Robles, a 35-year-old Hartford resident who is originally from Peru, leads the meditation. She asks the other participants to take deep, slow breaths and repeat affirmations for the guest of honor.
Robles, who was an obstetrician in Peru for eight years, and the other five women forming the circle are doulas-in-training at the community doula program, run by the Hispanic Health Council, or HHC, and funded by the Connecticut Health Foundation and Hartford HealthCare. 
The training is conducted entirely in Spanish, and aims to address a major maternal health gap in a city where over half of residents who give birth are Hispanic, according to the latest report from the state Department of Public Health.

A doula’s work consists of educating, informing and guiding the person who is or will get pregnant. They do not provide medical services. As a doula, one can specialize in prenatal care, labor and postpartum care, or all three.
“The doulas coming out of this program can be the ones advocating for the Spanish-speaking pregnant women, connecting them with resources and in the hospital. Imagine waiting nine months to give birth and you end up being ignored, and not being told things because, ‘Oh, she won’t understand.’ Discrimination is evident at the moment of care,” Robles said.
During the ceremony, the doulas warned the future mother not to be surprised if her nipples darken, as this happens so the baby, born with blurred vision, can find them and feed himself. They also taught her what types of massages her partner can perform to ease the pain of contractions, and they practiced breathing exercises together to prepare for when it’s time to push during a natural birth.
The event marked the end of two months of theory classes, which covered topics ranging from pregnancy physiology, nutrition, breastfeeding, and racism in the health care system for women of color.
Next, the doulas will complete in-person practices at Hartford Hospital. After getting certified, the women will be able to start their own businesses and provide services to the Hispanic community.
Bianca Noroñas, director of the maternal and child health center at HHC, runs the training and teaches the theory classes. She said the program aims to train people from the community to fill the gaps in maternal health needs. 
“We’re creating this workforce of people from our community so they can pursue additional careers, if they’re already professionals, or begin pursuing one if they haven’t had any education. We’re also building a workforce that allows them to learn about and explore public health,” Noroñas said. She herself has worked as a doula — first in Puerto Rico, where she grew up, and then in Connecticut.

The women in the program represent different parts of Latin America. Robles, Ximena Chavez, Gloria Gavidia, and Angela Rivadeneyra are from Peru, while Yisenia Martinez is from Puerto Rico and Deicin Garcia is from Mexico. All of them are mothers themselves. Some have been in Connecticut for many years, others just migrated two years ago. They are united by the opportunity to accompany Hispanic women in Hartford to have a dignified birth.
In the United States, there are studies and research that explore and quantify the benefits of having a doula during pregnancy. One of the most recent, which analyzed data from women with Medicaid doula services between 2014 and 2023, showed that these women had a 47% lower risk of cesarean delivery, a 29% lower risk of premature birth and 46% attended postpartum checkups.
Over the course of these two months of classes, the doulas formed a clear sorority bond among themselves, along with Noroñas. Being mothers, there were days when they would bring their daughters or sons to class and take care of them together. While one sat the other’s child on her lap and whispered a song, another opened cookie wrappers for the child to eat. 
Several of the women applied to the doula program because they find that work necessary in Spanish for Hispanic women in Connecticut. Also, during their own pregnancies, there was no one to guide them through giving birth in a foreign country with a different health care system.
There aren’t many studies on pregnancy and childbirth experiences of non-English speaking women in the U.S. One of the few is the September 2018 Listening to Mothers in California survey, which found that of some 2,500 mothers interviewed, 10% of those who spoke Spanish as their first language reported experiencing unfair treatment because of their language.
“I know many pregnant women who were not treated well, they didn’t give them proper explanations, they left with many doubts, and unpleasant experiences,” Robles said.

When Robles moved to Connecticut in 2022, she had a daughter and was pregnant with her second child. She worried about the costs of giving birth, as she was unfamiliar with Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut. Now, in addition to participating in the community doula program, she works with the Comadrona program of the HHC, which provides support services to pregnant women, and three years ago helped her secure health insurance and find a place to give birth.
“I would have loved to have a doula, because I practically gave birth alone. My husband was there for the C-section, but had to go to work right after,” Robles recalls. “My sister-in-law was caring for my baby and had to take time off from work to stay with my little one.”
Noroñas said it has been quite complex to educate the Hispanic community in Hartford about what a doula is and how they support new mothers. Sometimes, doula work is confused with the emotional care that people in a traditional family — such as a grandmother, sister, or aunt — provide without pay. But when these women immigrate to the U.S., they are often single or with a partner and lose the family unit that usually supports them during pregnancy in their countries.
“Many mothers here are alone in the postpartum period, during labor and even during prenatal care,” Noroñas said. “A doula could be the support that the mother needs during such an important time.”
Gavidia, who is part of Noroñas’ program, gave birth with a doula in the U.S. Many of the doulas-in-training like her come from families where women were involved in reproductive health in their countries. Her grandmother was a midwife and clandestinely distributed condoms in Peru to mothers who no longer wanted to have more children.

When Gavidia learned she was pregnant, she started researching and decided to find a doula due to the lack of a support network she had. Now a nursing student, Gavidia saw the doula program as an opportunity to offer support to women and complement both her clinical and emotional expertise.
“I’m going to be a doula because I know that many women in my community aren’t properly informed. They aren’t told about the power of doulas and the control they can have during birth, in hospitals, and even during medical appointments,” Gavidia said. “I also want to include fathers so they can be more present throughout the entire process.”
The next cohort of the doula program at HHC is expected to begin in October. Anyone with a high school diploma and over the age of 18 can apply.

En una mañana de viernes a principios de septiembre, un grupo de seis mujeres se sentaron frente a una velas pequeñas y flores en la sala de entrenamiento de parto ligeramente iluminada, en Hartford. Seis de las participantes forman un circulo alrededor de una mujer embarazada a casi un mes de parir. 
El grupo se reunió para una ceremonia destinada a transmitir paz y seguridad a la futura madre. Zaza Robles, una residente de Hartford de 35 años, originaria de Perú, guiaba la meditación en la que les pedía hacer respiraciones hondas y pausadas, y repetir afirmaciones para la invitada de honor.
Robles, quien por ocho años ejerció como obstetra en Perú, es parte de las seis doulas en entrenamiento del programa de doulas comunitarias del Consejo Hispano de Salud, o HHC, facilitado por la Fundación de Salud de Connecticut y Hartford HealthCare.
La capacitación se lleva a cabo completamente en español y tiene como objetivo abordar una importante brecha en la salud materna en una ciudad donde más de la mitad de los residentes que dan a luz son hispanos, según el último informe del Departamento de Salud Pública del estado.

El trabajo de doula consiste en educar, informar y guiar a la persona que esté gestando. No brindan servicios médicos. Como doula, una persona se puede especializar para acompañar el prenatal, asistir durante el parto y el post parto, o todo a la vez.
“Las doulas que salgan de este programa pueden ser quienes aboguen por las mujeres embarazadas que hablan español, con recursos y acompañandolas en el hospital. Te imaginas que te ignoren, te obvien, no te digan cosas porque ‘ah, ella no lo va a entender’. La discriminación se nota al momento de la atención”, sostiene Robles.
Durante la ceremonia espiritual, las doulas advirtieron a la embarazada participante que no se sorprendiera si sus pezones se oscurecen, ya que sucede para que el bebé, al nacer con la vista borrosa, pueda encontrarlos y alimentarse. Entre otras cosas, también le enseñaron qué tipo de masajes le puede hacer su acompañante o pareja, para aligerar el dolor de contracciones, y practicaron juntas las respiraciones ideales para pujar en caso de un parto natural. 
El evento fue el cierre de dos meses de capacitación teórica, en el que abordaron desde temas de fisiologia del embarazo, nutrición, lactancia, hasta racismo en el sistema de salud para mujeres de color.
En las siguientes semanas, las doulas deberán realizar prácticas en el Hospital de Hartford. Luego de certificarse, podrán crear sus propias empresas y proporcionar servicios a la comunidad hispana.
Bianca Noroñas, directora puertorriqueña del Centro de Salud Maternal y de Niños del HHC, dirige el entrenamiento de doulas. Explicó que el programa busca formar a personas de la misma comunidad para cubrir las necesidades no atendidas en salud materna.  
“Estamos creando este workforce de personas de nuestra comunidad para que tengan una profesión adicional, si es que ya eran profesionales, o comiencen a tener una profesión si no habían tenido un estudio. También para que conozcan y exploren lo que es la salud pública”, dijo Noroñas, quien fue también doula primero en Puerto Rico y ahora en Connecticut.

Las mujeres del programa son de diferentes partes de Latinoamérica. Robles, Ximena Chavez, Gloria Gavidia y Angela Rivadeneyra son de Perú, mientras que Yisenia Martinez es de Puerto Rico y la futura entrenadora de las próximas generaciones de doulas, Deicin García, de México. Todas son madres. Algunas llevan muchos años en Connecticut, otras recién migraron hace dos años. Las une la oportunidad de acompañar a mujeres hispanas en Hartford a tener un parto digno.
En Estados Unidos, hay estudios e investigaciones que exploran y cuantifican los beneficios de tener una doula durante el embarazo. Uno de los más recientes, que analizó datos de mujeres con servicios de doula en Medicaid entre el 2014 y 2023, demuestra que estas mujeres tuvieron un 47% de menos riesgo de cesárea, un 29% de menos riesgo de partos prematuros, y un 46% asistieron a chequeos médicos post-parto. 
A lo largo de estos dos meses de clases, las doulas crearon un evidente lazo de sororidad entre ellas, junto con Noroñas. Al ser madres, había días en que llevaban a sus hijas o hijos a las clases y les cuidaban entre todas. Mientras una sentaba al hijo de la otra en sus piernas y le susurraba una canción, la otra abría envolturas de unas galletas para que comiera. 
Varias de las mujeres aplicaron al programa porque vieron la importancia de ejercer el oficio de doulas en español para mujeres hispanas en Connecticut. También, porque durante sus propios embarazos no hubo nadie que las guiara a parir en un país ajeno al suyo con un sistema de salud diferente.
No existen muchos estudios sobre las experiencias durante el embarazo y parto de mujeres que no hablan inglés en EE.UU. Uno de los pocos es la encuesta Escuchando a las madres en California, de septiembre de 2018, que revela que de unas 2,500 madres entrevistadas, el 10% de las que hablaban español como primer idioma aseguraron haber experimentado un trato injusto a causa del idioma que dominaban. 
“Yo conozco a muchas mujeres embarazadas que no les atendieron bien, no les explicaron bien, salieron con muchas dudas, salieron con experiencias poco agradables”, recuerda Robles.

Robles se mudó a Connecticut en el 2022, embarazada y con una hija. Le preocupaban los costos de dar a luz, ya que le era desconocido el seguro de salud Medicaid, conocido como Husky en Connecticut. Ahora, aparte de estar en el programa de doulas comunitarias, trabaja con las Comadronas del HHC, que brindan apoyo y recursos para mujeres embarazadas y hace tres años le ayudaron a conseguir seguro médico y encontrar dónde parir.
“A mí me hubiera gustado mucho tener una doula, porque yo di a luz prácticamente sola, mi esposo entró a la cesárea, estuvo conmigo, pero se tuvo que ir a trabajar”, recuerda Robles. “Mi cuñada estaba a cargo de mi nena y tuvo que pedir permiso en su trabajo para quedarse con mi chiquita”.
Noroñas cuenta que ha sido un arduo trabajo educar a la comunidad hispana en Hartford sobre qué es una doula y cómo apoyar a las mamás. En ocasiones, el trabajo de las doulas se confunde con el de cuidados emocionales que las personas en una familia tradicional — como la abuela, la hermana o la tía — ejercen sin remuneraciones. Pero al emigrar a EE.UU, muchas veces las mujeres están solas o en pareja y pierden ese núcleo familiar que en sus países las apoya usualmente en el embarazo.
“Aquí muchas mamás están solas en el post parto, en el parto, están solas hasta en el prenatal”, dijo Noroñas. “La doula pudiera ser ese elemento que apoye a esa mamá en un momento tan importante”.
Gavidia, parte del programa de Noroñas, parió acompañada de una doula en EE.UU. Muchas de las futuras doulas como ella, vienen de familias en las cuales había mujeres involucradas en la salud reproductiva de sus países. Su abuela era partera y repartía clandestinamente condones en Perú a mamás que ya no querían tener más hijos.

Cuando Gavidia supo que estaba embarazada, empezó a informarse y decidió buscar una doula por la falta de red de apoyo en su nuevo país. Ahora, que estudia enfermería, vio la oportunidad del programa de doulas para acompañar a mujeres y complementar ambos conocimientos clínicos y emocionales.
“Voy a ser doula porque sé que a muchas mujeres de mi comunidad no se les informa debidamente, no les dicen del poder de las doulas y del control que ellas sí pueden tener en el parto, en los hospitales y hasta en las citas médicas”, dijo Gavidia. “También quiero incluir a los papás para que estén más presentes en todo el proceso”.
La próxima cohorte del programa de doulas en el HHC se espera que empiece en Octubre. Cualquier persona que haya cursado el bachillerato y sea mayor de 18 años puede aplicar. Las personas que estén interesadas en aplicar y ser seleccionadas, pueden enviar un correo electrónico a Noroñas a la dirección biancan@hispanichealthcouncil.org.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0905_SR_DoulaGraduation_102-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 10:58:25.078250
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 12:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,US DOJ official questions retired FBI agent’s role in $1.4B Sandy Hook lawsuit,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/doj-inquiry-william-aldenberg-sandy-hook-families-alex-jones/,DOJ's 'weaponization working group' asked retired agent William Aldenberg whether he benefited financially from helping with the families' lawsuit against Alex Jones.,"A senior U.S. Justice Department official sent a letter to a lawyer for relatives of victims killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, asking pointed questions about a retired FBI agent’s involvement in a defamation lawsuit that led to a $1.4 billion judgment against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Ed Martin Jr., who leads the Justice Department’s “weaponization working group,” asked in the letter whether retired agent William Aldenberg received any financial benefits from helping to organize the lawsuit, in which he was a plaintiff along with victims’ family members.
Aldenberg, like the parents and other relatives of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, has been the subject of false conspiracy theories spread by Jones on his “Infowars” broadcasts.
Aldenberg was among the law enforcement officers who responded to the school and found the dead children. That then led to years of abuse from people who believed the shooting was a hoax, he has said. His share of the judgment totaled around $120 million.
Martin sends lawyer letter asking about retired agent
In a Sept. 15 letter to Christopher Mattei, a lawyer who represents Sandy Hook families, Martin suggested he was scrutinizing Aldenberg’s role in the lawsuit.
“As you may know, there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit,” Martin wrote.
Mattei responded to the letter in a text message to The Associated Press.
“Thanks to the courage of the Sandy Hook families, Infowars will soon be finished,” he said, referring to the families’ efforts in court to liquidate Jones’ assets to help pay the judgment. “In his last gasps, Jones is once again harassing them, only now with the corrupt complicity of at least one DOJ official. It’s as disgusting as it is pathetic, and we will not stand for it.”
The Justice Department said it had no immediate comment Tuesday.
Martin, who has been examining President Donald Trump’s claims of anti-conservative bias inside the Justice Department, has sent letters to a host of targets in other, unrelated matters, seeking information or making appeals, but it’s unclear whether such requests have amounted to anything.
Jones posted a copy of the letter on his X account Tuesday, saying “Breaking! The DOJ’s Task Force On Government Weaponization Against The American People Has Launched An Investigation Into The Democrat Party / FBI Directing Illegal Law-fare Against Alex Jones And Infowars.”
Retired agent testified at the trial
Aldenberg joined the relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims in suing Jones, alleging defamation and infliction of emotional distress.
Aldenberg was one of the first witnesses to testify at the trial in 2022. He broke down on the witness stand as he described entering the two classrooms where children and educators were shot.
He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim.
Messages were left at a phone listing and email addresses listed for Aldenberg in public records.
Relatives of the shooting victims testified that they were subjected to violent threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media because of Jones.
Martin has been serving as head of the Justice Department’s “weaponization working group” since his nomination for top federal prosecutor in Washington was pulled amid bipartisan concerns about his modest legal experience and his advocacy for Jan. 6 rioters.
Attorney General Pam Bondi created the group to scrutinize matters in which conservatives have claimed they were unfairly targeted or treated.
Martin was also recently named a special prosecutor to help conduct the separate mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James and U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff.
In his letter to Mattei, he asked for several pieces of information and requested that the lawyer respond by Sept. 29.
In the letter, Martin asks Mattei to keep the correspondence confidential because “I do not wish to litigate this in the media.” On Sept. 14, Jones posted a photo on his X account of him and Martin together, saying the two met in Washington, D.C.
Jones recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his appeal of the $1.4 billion judgment. He also is appealing a $49 million judgment in similar lawsuit in Texas filed by two other parents of children killed in Newtown. He has cited free speech rights, but he has acknowledged that the shooting was “100% real.”
Jones claims Democrats have been targeting him for his speech.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Washoe County Commission failed to address “serious threats” to public safety and wildfire evacuation when it approved development amendments adopted in 2023 by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, says a Petition for Judicial Review filed Tuesday by the Tahoe Sierra Clean Air Coalition. 
The amendments, approved by the Washoe County Commission by a 3 to 1 vote in August, adopt TRPA standards that allow greater density, higher buildings, and reduced parking in town centers and multifamily areas. 
Tahoe Sierra Clean Air Coalition is headed by former firefighter Doug Flaherty, who last year commissioned a simulation that indicates evacuating 13,151 vehicles from Incline Village, a popular tourist destination with numerous hotels and more than 1,000 vacation rentals, would take seven hours and 20 minutes, if all roads were accessible. 
Evacuating Tahoe could take twice as long as projected, simulations indicate

“These are not minor changes. They intensify development in areas already vulnerable to wildfire and traffic congestion,” Flaherty, an Incline Village resident, told the commission in August. He and others opposed to higher-density development say they’ve exhausted their administrative remedies and are asking the Second Judicial District to revoke the commission’s vote. 
Commissioners, Flaherty said in a news release, “turned their back on the life safety concerns of Washoe Tahoe residents. They ignored clear, compelling substantial evidence and new information that these amendments, if implemented, will further place Washoe Tahoe residents and visitors’ lives at risk during a fast-moving, no-notice wildfire event.”
The petition notes Washoe County’s “own calculation” estimates that evacuating the Incline Village/Crystal Bay area would take six hours, and cites the Nevada Current’s reporting, in which a county spokesperson said the estimate focused on evacuating residents “is now outdated and we don’t have an updated estimate because we do not have the funding for a study,”  
In an interview earlier this month, Washoe County Chairwoman Alexis Hill said the county received a $170,000 donation in February from an undisclosed source to conduct an evacuation study. 
The petition asserts the county has yet to issue requests for proposals for the study. Hill, however, says “the RFP is out, and we’re going to be choosing someone.” She said the county intends to work with the Desert Research Institute on the study. Time constraints placed on Washoe County by the TRPA prevented the county from holding off on adopting the amendments until the evacuation study was completed, Hill said. 
The commission, the petition notes, was advised that the evacuation study would not affect the amendments, “as the proposed changes did not require consideration of criteria relating to evacuations and emergency management.” 
“If something comes out of a study that we need to look at something new, I’m always open to new data,” Hill said. “I don’t want to operate in a vacuum, so I’m very open to seeing what the results are.”
Hill, who announced this month she’s running in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, is a member of the TRPA board, supports higher density, and says it will ultimately be best for everyone.
She disputes the allegations of critics who contend she failed to engage with residents opposed to the plan. 
“I’ve had numerous emails. I’ve certainly chatted with people on the phone,” she said. “I’ve heard folks’ concerns. I don’t always listen to the loudest voices in the room. I actually listen to our diverse community, and there are many workers who would love to stay and live and serve Incline Village and Crystal Bay. This will help ensure that we have a workforce in the community.”
The county commission, the petition says, “took guidance from its counsel” who asserted the TRPA amendments preempted local authority, and would go into effect even if rejected.  
“Counsel indicated that the Board did not really have a choice” but to approve the TRPA’s amendments, the petition says, and would consider the residents’ concerns “at some unspecified future time in some unspecified proceeding.” 
Hill agrees the commission had no choice. “If a developer went to TRPA, they would override the county. The TRPA is approved by a federal compact dictated by both states, so they have more authority than the county does.” 
Hill and Washoe County Chief Deputy District Attorney for the Civil Division Michael Large declined to comment on the legal action.
TRPA spokesman Jeff Cowen says local governments can incorporate the incentives for development “as-is or modify them to fit their local vision.” 
Proposed modifications are evaluated to determine if they create “the same level of cost savings” to developers as the amendments adopted by TRPA in 2023, such as greater height and density, a larger building footprint, and lower parking requirements.  
Cowen notes no applications have been received for development under the new standards, which require a commitment to “100 percent deed-restricted workforce housing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1337303982-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

Read this story in English.
Más de siete docenas de leyes de Connecticut, relativas a diversos temas, desde regulaciones sobre bicicletas eléctricas y cascos hasta la caza en domingo, entrarán en vigor total o parcialmente el 1 de octubre.
Las leyes de Connecticut son aprobadas por la Asamblea General durante la sesión legislativa de cada año (la de este año se extendió del 8 de enero al 4 de junio) o en una sesión especial. Suelen entrar en vigor el 1 de enero, el 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre.
A continuación, un vistazo a algunas de las leyes que se implementarán el próximo mes.
Reforma de las leyes de remolque
Una reforma de las leyes de remolque de Connecticut, con un siglo de antigüedad, incluye varias medidas para dificultar el remolque de vehículos desde propiedades privadas y facilitar a los conductores la recuperación de sus vehículos después de un remolque.
La ley estatal permite a las empresas de remolque iniciar el proceso de venta de un vehículo remolcado con un valor de $1,500 o menos después de 15 días, uno de los plazos más cortos del país. La nueva ley aún permite a las compañías de remolque iniciar el proceso de venta después de 15 días, pero ahora deberán tomar medidas adicionales para que el propietario tenga la oportunidad de reclamar el vehículo, y la venta real no podrá concretarse hasta 30 días después del remolque.
También exige que las compañías de remolque acepten tarjetas de crédito y no les permite remolcar vehículos inmediatamente, solo por tener un permiso de estacionamiento o registro vencido. Los vehículos no pueden ser remolcados de una propiedad privada sin previo aviso, a menos que obstruyan el tráfico o las bocas de incendio, o estén estacionados en un lugar accesible para personas con discapacidad.
El proyecto de ley se aprobó tras una investigación de CT Mirror y ProPublica que demostró cómo las leyes estatales de remolque han llegado a favorecer a las compañías de remolque en detrimento de los propietarios de vehículos.
Un grupo de trabajo del Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados de Connecticut se dispone a examinar partes de la ley estatal de remolque que van mucho más allá de su mandato original, lo que podría conducir a reformas más amplias.
Caza en domingo
A partir del 1 de octubre, Connecticut permitirá la caza los domingos, con algunas limitaciones.
La nueva ley permite la caza en domingo, pero la limita a propiedades privadas y prohíbe cualquier caza a menos de 40 yardas de una ruta de senderismo marcada con bandera azul o designada por el gobierno federal. El proyecto de ley también prohíbe la caza de aves migratorias los domingos.
Los cazadores lucharon sin éxito durante décadas para revocar la prohibición estatal de la caza en domingo, que han descrito como la última de las históricas “leyes azules” de Connecticut. En 2015, los legisladores derogaron parcialmente la prohibición para los cazadores con arco.
Cascos
Una nueva ley eleva la edad mínima para que los conductores y pasajeros de motocicletas usen casco de 18 a 21 años, con una multa mínima de $90 por infracciones.
Esta ley también exige que los menores de 18 años usen casco al conducir vehículos como bicicletas, patinetas y monopatines. Anteriormente, solo los menores de 16 años debían usar casco.
Bicicletas eléctricas
Otra nueva ley clasifica algunas bicicletas eléctricas, que anteriormente carecían de regulación en materia de licencias y registro, como ciclos o vehículos motorizados.
La ley clasifica las bicicletas eléctricas sin pedales y con baterías de más de 750 vatios como vehículos motorizados, que requieren licencia de conducir para operar, pero no están obligadas a estar registradas en el estado.
Las bicicletas eléctricas con baterías de más de 3,500 vatios se clasificarán como vehículos motorizados. Es esencialmente la misma clasificación que las motocicletas y requiere que los vehículos estén registrados y asegurados.
Además, dado que las bicicletas eléctricas se pueden modificar fácilmente para alcanzar velocidades superiores a 96 km/h, la nueva ley, generalmente exige que quienes modifiquen la velocidad de una bicicleta eléctrica, etiqueten el vehículo con la modificación correspondiente.
Esposas para niños
Los agentes de policía tendrán prohibido en gran medida esposar a menores de 14 años, excepto en casos en que sea necesario para la seguridad pública o cuando el menor utilice o amenace con usar fuerza física contra un agente.
La ley vigente establece que se deben retirar las restricciones, como las esposas, a un menor antes y durante una comparecencia ante el tribunal. Esta ley no se modificó.
Matrimonios entre primos hermanos
La ley de Connecticut prohibirá ahora que los primos hermanos se casen a sabiendas. Los hijos de primos hermanos tienen un mayor riesgo de padecer trastornos genéticos y defectos de nacimiento.
La ley vigente de Connecticut, que sigue vigente, prohíbe que una persona se case con su padre, madre, hijo, abuelo, nieto, hermano, hermano del padre, padrastro o hijastro.

(Photo by Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)Now that Congress has reauthorized and expanded the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to cover all of Utah for people who developed serious illnesses from nuclear weapons testing, a St. George clinic is touring different cities in the state to inform the public about the program.
With new areas eligible under RECA and an increased compensation amount, Intermountain Health is inviting downwinders to attend public informational meetings in the Provo-Orem area and Salt Lake City — in addition to Idaho Falls — this week. Applications will be available on site.
Intermountain Health’s Downwinders Clinic, located in St. George Regional Hospital’s Cancer Center, has offered free programs for downwinders, including education, health care assistance and help with RECA payment applications  — even during the federal program’s 13-month hiatus, when Congress failed to reauthorize it. 
Utah health clinic to resume screening and helping downwinders apply for compensation

After Congress in July approved its massive spending bill, which included the reauthorization of RECA, patients in the expansion areas, who have recently been diagnosed with cancer, or who didn’t know about the program are eligible for compensation. 
However, those who have already been compensated by the program aren’t able to apply for additional funds. 
In the past RECA allowed for payments of $50,000 and only 10 counties in the state were covered by the program. But now, payments will be $100,000 for new applicants and all of Utah is considered an affected area. So, those who lived in the state for at least 12 months between 1951 and 1962 and contracted a certain type of cancer may be entitled for compensation. 
According to Intermountain Health, eligible cancers haven’t changed. They include leukemia — but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia — multiple myeloma, lymphomas (other than Hodgkin’s), and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.

Voters will choose between Greg Barnes and Dustin Beaty. There are no Democrats in the race, so the winner will serve as the new representative. A third candidate, Mike Elliott, qualified for the election but was taken off the certification of candidates last week. The Daily Mountain Eagle, a local Jasper newspaper, reported that Elliott did not comply with an Alabama Ethics Commission form.
The Alabama GOP sent a new certification of candidates, without Elliott, on Sept. 15 to the Secretary of State.

Messages seeking comment from Elliott and the Alabama Ethics Commission were left Monday. 
The seat was left vacant when former Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to represent Senate District 5 this summer in a special election. The district is solidly Republican. It has not had a Democratic representative since Rep. Tommy Sherer was defeated by Republican Bill Roberts in 2010, according to election results. 
Messages seeking comment from Barnes were left Monday and Tuesday.

The candidates

Beaty, 52, is a pharmacist and owns several businesses in Jasper. He said in a phone interview he wants to make Walker County a place where people want to stay for generations.
“We want to create an environment where our kids have jobs and they can stay in Walker County. Families can stay together, so grandparents can stay with their grandkids, because their grandkids can find jobs here in Walker County,” Beaty said. 
Beaty’s tasks to achieve that goal are increasing economic and workforce development, lowering taxes and securing funding for roads. 
Barnes, 67, said in a previous interview that he is prioritizing mental health, veterans support and parental rights in education. Barnes also ran for the seat in 2022 against Woods and received 11.4% of votes, according to election results.
“We desperately need consistent financial support for the mental health institutions in Alabama and to assist the mentally ill in our society,” Barnes said in July. “Placing them in prison or in jail doesn’t help them or society in the long term. This needs to be addressed before they become too mentally ill to be helped.”

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Barnes funded his campaign entirely with $20,000 and has not reported any other contributions. He  spent $18,677 through Sept. 23. He said in a previous interview that he would fund his campaign on his own.
Beaty raised $131,614 as of Tuesday and spent $126,843, according to campaign finance records. About 22% of his funds have come from political action committees (PACs), the rest from individuals and businesses.
Before Elliott was removed from the ballot, he raised $51,450 and spent $49,527.58, according to campaign finance records. About 46% of Elliott’s funds came from PACs, the rest from individuals and businesses.  

How to vote

District 13 voters can choose between Barnes and Beaty on Tuesday. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here.

The University of Nevada Las Vegas ranked 95th out of 257 colleges for its free speech climate, while the University of Nevada Reno came in a few spots lower at 100th.
Both UNLV and UNR received an “F” grade, earning 59 out of 100. Nationally, the average overall score was 58.6.
Only 11 schools nationwide received a speech climate grade of “C” or higher.
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression described a “mixed picture” at UNLV.
The university ranked in the top 50 when it came to students feeling comfortable expressing controversial ideas, “indicating that open discussion may occur at a higher rate than other schools,” but in the bottom 25 for self-censorship, meaning students may be more likely to stay silent during discussions with peers or professors for fear of backlash.
UNLV was docked two points for having one “speech controversy.”
In February 2024, an open lecture by visiting Israeli physics professor Asaf Peer on black holes was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protestors. Peer told the Nevada Current that campus police informed him they could not remove the protesters and instead ended the lecture and escorted him off campus. He disagreed with the handling of the event.
FIRE listed no speech controversies at UNR.
But UNR ranked in the bottom 25 for “openness,” described as students feeling like many topics are off limits in class or social settings.
The surveys also found that, among the UNLV and UNR students:

68% said shouting down a speaker to prevent them from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases;
41% said they have self-censored on campus at least once or twice a month; and
32% said using violence to stop someone from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases.

FIRE estimates that across the universities there are nearly three liberal students for one conservative student.
The two universities were the only two Nevada institutions included in the analysis by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which six years ago began surveying college students on their perceptions of free speech at their campuses. This year, approximately 68,500 students across the country were surveyed by the organization, which used the responses, as well as institution policies and public controversies, to assign free speech scores and grades.
Brookings Mountain West, in a fact sheet summarizing the FIRE report, noted that all 16 colleges and universities across the Mountain West region received ‘’F” grades for political tolerance.
Nevada overall ranked worse than Arizona and Colorado, which received “D+” and “D-” grades, respectively. Nevada had the same average score as Utah.
FIRE’s findings were released earlier this month, one day before the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university on Sept. 10.
Among the takeaways highlighted by the report: “The percentage of students saying it is acceptable to shout down a speaker, block entry to a campus speech, or use violence to stop a campus speech all increased since last year and are at record highs.”
In a statement released after Kirk’s shooting, UNLV Interim President Chris Heavey said college campuses have “long stood as special places in American society where people of different viewpoints can meet, question, and challenge one another without fear.”
He continued, “To see violence enter those spaces is to see the very foundation of higher learning threatened.”
Heavey noted that Kirk visited UNLV in October 2024 without incident.

The changes to Ordinance 1533 were postponed for a second reading and possible adoption to the Oct. 21 council meeting. The commission, which was established in July 2021, is responsible for police accountability.
Councilmembers Dana Watson and Mark Meadows requested the delay, and the motion passed unanimously, with the city attorney confirming there was no legal concern with deferring the vote.
Although the adoption was delayed, the council also considered whether to release a cross-reference document that details the proposed changes. Councilmember Erik Altmann, who voted no, mentioned that the Labor Council advised against publication, citing complicated legal implications. However, the council voted 4–1 in favor of releasing the document to the public and to the commission.

Following a report from East Lansing Info on September 9, the council met in a closed special session with labor attorney Gouri Sashital to review a legal opinion from labor counsel. Oversight Commissioner Chris Root requested that the council share a confidential document explaining how changes to the ordinance are mandated by the new police contract. Root noted the council could waive confidentiality with a majority vote.
These new changes were a result of a new contract between the city and the East Lansing Police Department patrol officers’ union, which also led the commission to hire outside attorneys due to concerns about transparency and accountability.
The contract introduces significant changes to the ordinance governing the commission, limiting its ability to review complaints before final decisions are made, withholding the names of officers in use-of-force and crisis-related reports, and prohibiting the commission or its members from commenting on pending complaints, internal investigations, personnel matters, or ongoing police operations.
Changes to the ordinance and its potential effects have been discussed at several previous meetings. Those opposing the proposed changes have argued that they represent an attack on the community, as they remove their ability to independently oversee the police, which could lead to unchecked abuses of power.
“In a democratic society, the powerful must be subject to scrutiny by the people, and there is no greater power than that of life and death, which the police hold over others,” Karen Hoene from the city’s Human Rights Commission said. “People will not be sure whether they will be treated fairly, as there will be no easily accessible, impartial authority with any real power to investigate abuses. At this critical time in our nation’s history, we’re at another page.”
Additionally, Root emphasized the positive importance of releasing the cross-referencing document, which clarifies the source of changes to the ordinance, adding that this was an action they had been expecting since August 12.
On the other hand, in contrast of several recent violent incidents downtown, Ali Haider, a downtown business owner, mentioned that East Lansing police “did an amazing job” in apprehending the attackers who had been harassing his business and employees during late-night hours.
“So, when somebody’s making an arrest, it’s not about the race. When somebody’s filing a complaint, it’s not about the race,” Haider said. “People are doing their job. If anyone is going to come to the downtown and they’re going to create a disturbance, cops are supposed to arrest them.”
In addition to concerns about downtown safety and the recent changes to the oversight commission, Councilmember Watson stated that it is essential that no one be subjected to more rigorous scrutiny based on their race or stereotypes, and that all residents must be treated equally under the police actions.
“The cops have to be held accountable to the community as well. And so, especially if people might be noticing or thinking that it’s driven by Black and brown people, then it’s important that we have a balance and we have someone else with eyes on it. Because I don’t deserve to just get looked at hard because of the color of my skin when I go out places, harder than my white counterparts,” Watson said.

Mike Kehoe speaks briefly at a Sept. 9 meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force in the Missouri Special Olympics office building in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Education and business leaders shaping Missouri’s public school funding formula are hoping to rework the way the state funds students with higher needs.
The Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force’s four working groups held their initial meetings Tuesday and last Wednesday, and there were some common themes in their discussions..
During Tuesday’s meetings of the student counts and funding target work groups, both leaned toward ideas to remove funding cliffs in the state’s funding of students with higher needs.
The funding target group is looking into a metric currently called the State Adequacy Target. The number is calculated by looking at the per-pupil expenses of the state’s high-performing districts and becomes the base for calculation of state aid.
This model has its benefits, with more stability over time than figures based on property value, said Don Thalhuber, policy director for the Senate Minority Caucus and drafter of the state’s current formula.
“This kind of convoluted structure was put in place to make sure that our formula did not spiral upward too quickly,” he said.
One of the major changes in 2005 was to move away from a formula that encouraged higher local tax rates to one based on spending. But drafters might have overcorrected, he said, since that target has remained largely stagnant since its inception, increasing just 17% compared to a 65% rise in inflation.
Kari Monsees, the state education department’s former finance chief, told the group that a target focused on high performers doesn’t work well for schools with “dramatically different” needs.
“Sometimes it is hard to make that translation, even if you try to do it with student weightings and things of that sort,” he said. “Trying to balance those scales is important.”
Student weightings are in the current formula as a multiplier that increases funding to districts with high-needs students. But there is a threshold, meaning that the state assumes a certain level of students qualify as low-income, special education or English language learners. Those with a higher portion of students in those groups receive the additional funding.
“I think the thresholds should just be eliminated,” said state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican appointed to the task force. “A student is a student… If we are going to have categories and they fall into that category, the school should get that funding.”
All three studies of the formula the task force is reviewing have recommended that the state remove the thresholds, including a 2023 study by University of Miami teaching chair Bruce Baker.
“The threshold approach theoretically overfunds districts with need shares lower than the thresholds, which makes little sense, when that funding could instead be targeted to those  districts with much greater needs. That is, for the same total cost, larger weights could be applied, but across the full range of need, on a lower base,” Baker wrote in the study.
Thalhuber made a similar point Tuesday, anticipating that the group will have to “wrestle with” funding at a stronger base level with weaker multipliers or having a weaker base with stronger weights for need-based funding.
Monsees kicked off the second meeting of the day explaining that reality to the student counts working group.
“If you wanted to raise the weighting factors significantly, and let’s say there’s a very limited amount of additional money that could support that, you’d have to come up with a lower funding target or a lower state adequacy target to make the math work,” he said.
The thresholds are a result of the adequacy target calculation, Monsees said.
“The idea is the high-performing districts that were established in the state adequacy target were already serving that percentage of students on average,” he said, adding that it is possible to remove the thresholds.
The groups are scheduled to meet an additional five times before presenting their recommendations to the broader task force.

,California,2025-09-24 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Department of Justice lawsuit claims Inland Empire Health Plan committed Medi-Cal fraud,Aidan McGloin,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/medi-cal-fraud-ie-health-plan/,The Department of Justice claims Inland Empire Health Plan committed fraud by using funds meant to expand the program for non-medical expenses.,"In summary
The Department of Justice claims Inland Empire Health Plan committed fraud by using funds meant to expand the program for non-medical expenses. 


The Inland Empire Health Plan kept $320 million that it should have given back to the federal government, a federal lawsuit claims.
IEHP is responsible for providing Medi-Cal to 1.6 million people throughout the Inland Empire—35% of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties’ combined population.
The complaint claims that IEHP committed fraud by putting money for the medical care of new Medi-Cal patients towards non-medical expenses or the care of existing patients.
The suit also alleges that IEHP created bonus programs for regional health systems using the Medi-Cal expansion money, and used the federal money as a bargaining chip to negotiate better care rates for people with IEHP insurance. 
The agency ended up giving the federal government $30 million back. The complaint charges the final sum of falling $320 million short.
“Today’s lawsuit against IEHP shows our steadfast commitment to hold accountable insurers that brazenly compromise the Medicaid system,” said Acting United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “We will take every measure to restore integrity and accountability to the Medicaid system and ensure that patient care – not financial gain – is the primary focus of our health care system.”
The agency’s attorney, Winston Chan of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, wrote in an emailed statement that the benefits paid through the program were already approved by regulators.
“The allegations are a brazen attempt at revisionist history that is not only wrong as to the facts and law, but also particularly galling in light of the federal government’s wider attacks on state Medicaid funding,” he wrote.
The federal government gave IEHP funds to expand Medi-Cal from Jan. 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016, according to the suit. At least 85% of the funding was intended to pay for the initially high costs of providing healthcare to the newly insured. Any funding from the program not used for those medical costs would have to be paid back to the federal government, the suit says. The complaint claims that IEHP committed fraud by putting the money towards non-medical expenses or the care of people already covered by Medi-Cal. 
“Every MCE dollar that IEHP improperly spent on ineligible expenses—such as other patient populations, consultants, or lawyers—was effectively an extra dollar in IEHP’s pocket because IEHP did not have to spend money from its general budget,” the suit says.
The agency spent $50 million of the funds to attempt to create a health record system for the geographic area served by the IEHP, the suit said. Instead of paying the company, Huron Consulting Group, directly with the funds, IEHP administrators paid providers, who then paid Huron, the complaint said. 
The complaint cited an email from former IEHP’s Chief Executive Officer Bradley Gilbert:
“The funds have to flow through the two county hospitals from IEHP so I can get credit for them as medical costs or the dollars go back to the state. So we will have to set it up so that IEHP pays the hospitals and then the money is used for the data integration effort,” the email said.
A June 3, 2015, email from Gilbert, included in the complaint, discussed the difficulty of spending all the money from the government.
“I will have to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars beyond actual medical costs,” the complaint quotes Gilbert.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825-Doctor-Patient-Medical-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010
,California,2025-09-24 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s insurance commissioner targets Consumer Watchdog fees,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-insurance-commissioner-consumer-watchdog/,"The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog collects ""intervenor fees"" for participating in premium setting in the Department of Insurance. It says it saves consumers millions of dollars more than it collects.","The horrific string of wildfires that has plagued California in recent years, taking dozens of lives and destroying many billions of dollars in property, also created a crisis in property insurance.
Some insurers have abandoned California altogether, some have refused to take more clients, many have sought premium increases and the state’s insurer-of-last-resort, the FAIR plan, has seen so much new business that its long-term solvency is in doubt. Meanwhile, fire victims often complain that insurers and their adjusters are low-balling settlement offers.
Obviously California’s property insurance market needs reform of some kind to improve its viability, but it’s an infinitely complex mélange of financial risks and rewards, truly understood by only a few experts.
Ricardo Lara, a former state legislator, happened to be California’s elected insurance commissioner when the crisis hit home, so by default he had to develop a response while simultaneously fielding complaints from victims and dealing with insurers’ demand for premium increases to cover mounting losses.
Lara has proposed a major overhaul in how insurers calculate their potential losses, seeking premium adjustments and a shift from using only past experience to projecting future losses, which is called “catastrophe modeling.” It is necessary, he said, to persuade insurers to keep writing policies in California and stave off a collapse of the market.
The proposal has heightened Lara’s feud with Consumer Watchdog which began even before his 2018 election.
The organization had sponsored the 1988 ballot measure that converted the insurance commissioner’s position from an appointed job to an elected post and laid down a new set of rules for regulating premiums.
Thereafter, Consumer Watchdog enjoyed close relationships with elected commissioners and was awarded many millions of dollars in “intervenor fees” for participating in premium-setting cases in the Department of Insurance. The nonprofit organization contends that its participation has saved consumers many more dollars than it has collected in fees.
From the onset of Lara’s bid for the office, Consumer Watchdog was critical of him, alleging he was too friendly with insurers. When Lara unveiled his overhaul of the premium setting process, adopting an approach insurers supported, the feud escalated.
Nevertheless, throughout Lara’s tenure, Consumer Watchdog has continued to receive large intervenor fees paid by insurers. However, that may not be true in the future.
Last week Lara proposed another procedural overhaul, this time changing how intervenor fees are calculated and awarded, saying “these reforms will, for the first time, protect consumers from hidden fees, establish clear guidelines for intervenor participation and strengthen oversight of the administrative hearing system to prevent unnecessary delays.”
Lara’s proposal includes redefining the “substantial contribution” standard for awarding intervenor fees, requiring more public reportage of intervenor activities and compensation, requiring officials who preside over rate cases to file regular reports on pending cases and requiring the Department of Insurance to post rate case documents online.
The proposal’s “substantial contribution” element is the one that could affect Consumer Watchdog’s finances.  Lara left no doubt it is aimed at the organization.
Lara described the current process, created by the first elected commissioner, John Garamendi, in the early 1990s as lacking transparency and “dominated by a small number of recurring participants.”
To punctuate that characterization, Lara released a list of 28 rate cases this year, 26 of which resulted in nearly $1.4 million in intervenor fees for Consumer Watchdog.
Consumer Watchdog, not surprisingly, opposes Lara’s new rules.
“If the goal of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s new intervenor compensation regulations is to bring in new intervenors into the process, his regulations will do the opposite,” Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. “By making it harder for intervenors to be paid, he will discourage intervenors from participating.”
Thus the feud, already 6 years old, will continue, at least until term limits end Lara’s tenure and another commissioner is elected next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091924-Ricardo-Lara-FG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) has been receiving a large volume of phone calls regarding an alleged Ponzi scheme involving a prominent Georgia man, ASC Director Amanda Senn said Tuesday.
“We were inundated with phone calls about that scheme. We wanted to make sure the public knew that if we had investors that were harmed, we were monitoring and we would evolve or get engaged if necessary,” Senn said to commissioners during a regular meeting. .
She told the commission the ASC was working with Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen to ensure the money was returned.
“We’re in contact with authorities regularly, so we’re on top of that there and working with the Secretary of State for assistance we can provide there and vice versa,” Senn said.
Senn said in an interview Tuesday ASC is following the case for any updates that interest Alabama.
“We’re still continuing to monitor the information that comes out of the investigation and if there is an Alabama interest that is not protected or addressed by the Georgia investigation, we will certainly enter the fold,” she said.
Edwin Brant Frost IV was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme that made contributions to at least three Alabama Republicans.
Allen called for all politicians and political action committees (PACs) to return any contributions that were involved with the alleged scheme.
Then Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, who is now the Alabama State Auditor; Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont and Alabama State Board of Education Member Allen Long are among Republican officials who received contributions from Frost.
The SEC alleged Frost misappropriated over $5 million of investor funds for himself and his family and used $570,000 of the misappropriated funds for political donations. According to campaign financial records, Frost, his family members or his businesses contributed at least $132,000 to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs)
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family. Sorrell’s PAC also made a loan of $29,000 to Frost’s company First Liberty Building and Loan.
Harrison received over $21,000 in donations from Brant Frost V in 2022 and State Board of Education member Allen Long received $40,000 from First National Investments, one of Frost’s companies, in December 2023.
Sorrell and Harrison have since  returned the donations to the court-appointed receiver.

And without a more permanent fix to funding the state’s self-insurance fund, the Department of Enterprise Services warns its gap could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027. By mid-2029, the deficit could be anywhere from $2 billion to $3.2 billion. 
The department is also asking the governor to propose adjusting the insurance fund’s ongoing funding to minimize this shortfall. This would mean hundreds of millions more dollars per year to offset the state’s payouts.
The request is among those state agencies have submitted in recent days to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office as he prepares a budget proposal ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Premiums paid by state agencies finance the liability account, but those premiums haven’t kept pace with surging costs associated with legal claims against the state. In the 2023-25 biennium, the state paid nearly $800 million in settlements and court judgments. Another $110 million went toward legal fees. 
In the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, the liability fund brought in just under $230 million, mostly from premiums, while spending $595 million, mostly for payouts and legal costs, according to state data.
This predicament has left the account financially underwater, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The state previously poured more than $200 million into it in fiscal year 2022. But the problem has grown worse since then, and the account is now being allowed to operate in a temporary deficit up to about $1 billion with authorization from the budget office, Office of Financial Management spokesperson Hayden Mackley said.
The shortfall represents the extent to which the state is being held to account for decades of alleged misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases. For example, a Spokane County jury recently ordered the state to pay a woman $42 million for failing to protect her from years of childhood sexual abuse.
So far this year, Washington has paid out about $89 million in these cases, not including that recent $42 million verdict, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The deluge of lawsuits over the past few years shows no signs of slowing down. Last June, an actuary estimated the state faced $2.5 billion in liability from pending claims, straining an already-reeling state budget.
This year, lawmakers skirted the issue of the state’s ballooning payouts as they dealt with a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
By not spending to shore up the liability account, lawmakers punted the issue into next year’s legislative session, which begins in January. 
Legislators next year will pass a supplemental budget, making adjustments to the two-year spending plan approved earlier this year.
Setting the issue aside for this year, “gives us time to work with state agencies to solve this problem over a longer horizon,” said Mackley, with the Office of Financial Management. 
“Before the next legislative session, DES must work with its actuarial services provider, OFM, legislative staff, and other appropriate agencies to review the rates, funding structure, and other potential solutions to address this fund’s insolvency,” Ferguson’s budget director, K.D. Chapman-See, wrote in July to the acting director of the Department of Enterprise Services.
Mackley said the Office of Financial Management will review the budget request. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The issue has lawmakers’ attention.
Senate Republicans’ budget lead called the liability payouts “one of the fastest-growing line items in the state’s budget.”
“If there’s bad conduct at state agencies and we’re losing lawsuits because of it, we need to hold folks accountable and the Legislature needs to step in and do its rightful job in that,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, said during a panel hosted last week by the Association of Washington Business.
Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, responded that she hopes to see “some good bipartisan legislation that addresses some of our tort liability.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

(Getty Images)For decades, one of the most consistent findings in religion research has been that women tend to be more religious than men. This holds true across dozens of countries and on nearly every measure of religiosity, from how often someone prays to how important faith is in their lives.

Social scientists have struggled to pinpoint a universal cause for this pattern. Theories run the gamut – from the claim that it has something to do with women being more risk averse to the argument that religion offers women support for social responsibilities around birth, death and raising children.
In the past few years, however, survey data in the U.S. has started to tell a different story. Today, there is less empirical evidence that women are more religious than men – a debate I’ve tracked closely as a quantitative scholar of American religion. Looking at Generation Z, in particular, a number of results have raised some eyebrows, pointing toward other divides throughout the country.
Shrinking gap
In 2023, the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life found that 39% of Gen Z women say they do not have a religious affiliation, compared to 34% of men from the same generation. The past several waves of data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey, have found that men born after 1990 – a mix of younger millennials and Gen Z – are slightly more likely to attend religious services weekly than women of the same age.
When I give a lecture or presentation, often the first question I’m asked is about this surprising result.
I warn people to take it with a grain of salt. According to data from the 2022 General Social Survey, one of the most well-respected national polls, the opposite is true: among Americans ages 18-45, women are still more likely to attend a house of worship nearly every week. And the Pew Religious Landscape Study, which was released in February 2025, concludes, “While the gender gap in American religion appears to be narrowing, there are still no birth cohorts in which men are significantly more religious than women.”
All together, a growing body of survey evidence suggests that the overall religiosity of young American adults does not vary significantly by gender.
Anecdotal reports about scores of young men flocking to church or joining religious communities like Eastern Orthodoxy seem to grab headlines. However, the idea of a reversal in the gender gap is not supported by evidence – only that it is narrowing.
Drifting apart
If America’s gender gap around religion is changing, perhaps politics can help explain why.
A growing body of survey data suggests that overall, young men are moving further to the right on political matters, while young women are becoming increasingly progressive.
An NBC News poll in April 2025 found that among people ages 30-44, men were about 9 percentage points more likely to approve of Donald Trump’s job performance than women of the same age. Among those ages 18-29, the gap widened to a staggering 21 points.



				This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.			


A few months later, NBC polled nearly 3,000 young Americans about how they define success, asking them to select the top three factors from a list of 13. Overall, men between 18-29 rated “being married” and “having children” slightly higher than women their age. Among Gen Z men who voted for Trump, having children was the most important. Women who voted for Kamala Harris, meanwhile, ranked children near the bottom.
The largest religious traditions in America today are evangelical Protestant Christianity and the Catholic Church. Both groups’ teachings emphasize “traditional” gender roles, marriage and having children. For a growing wave of young progressive women, such teachings are at odds with their desire to make advances in the workplace and society. Some analysts argue that those tensions, as well as views on LGBTQ+ rights, are driving women away from institutional religion.
Opposite directions
As a result, Generation Z may be the most visible manifestation of the growing “God gap” in American politics.
In short, the religious compositions of the two major political parties have gone in opposite directions. In the 1990s, 67% of Republicans said they believed in God without a doubt, and 63% of Democrats said the same, according to my analysis of General Social Survey data. By 2022, certain belief in God had dropped to 39% among Democrats, while holding fairly steady among Republicans, at 63%. Twenty-eight percent of Democrats regularly attend a house of worship, compared to 42% of Republicans; in the 1970s, the gap was only 4 percentage points.
This all points to a broader, potentially more polarized future for the American public. Already, there is evidence that a growing number of people choose their house of worship based on political tribe, not just theological beliefs, making congregations less diverse. Women’s and men’s competing interests and preferences may make it harder to find a suitable partner. Common ground may be harder to find when there are fewer chances for interaction and conversation.
Ultimately, these trends suggest a future where polarization extends beyond politics and into the very fabric of American life – shaping where people worship, who they marry, and how communities form.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After meeting for just over three cumulative hours this year, the interim courts committee came to a close Tuesday without making any recommendations on its assigned topic. 
The panel of lawmakers and outside appointees — which includes Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush — previously heard two hours of testimony on medical debt. But Sen. Liz Brown, the committee’s chair, said they were still waiting on additional information from hospitals and couldn’t finalize suggestions ahead of the 2026 legislative session.
“I think some of us are still waiting,” Brown said. “The (Indiana) Hospital Association, for example, was asked to get us information on their charity care and their payment systems and how they interface or share that with patients. I have gotten a very small snippet; they’re still surveying their members.”
Consumer groups, debt collectors clash in medical debt hearing

Most of Tuesday’s meeting was spent analyzing how the state will move forward on its weighted caseload management system — in other words, ensuring that judicial duties are spread out evenly across the state’s hundreds of courts. A last-minute addition to House Enrolled Act 1144 eliminated courts and magistrate positions in four counties, reviving the discussion about long-term rebalancing. 
“We need an approach to assess when a reallocation of resources should occur in light of population shifts … where populations are moving towards more urban areas and away from rural areas,” said Grant County Circuit Court Judge Mark Spitzer. 
Spitzer is a committee member and also the president of the Indiana Judges Association. He discussed the considerations needed to support overutilized and underutilized county-level courts and methods of measuring demand across various case types. 
A report annually submitted to the Indiana Supreme Court, for example, found that the average Level 6 felony — the lowest level — took 98 minutes of a judge’s time from start to finish. Spitzer shared that judges, especially those in smaller counties, may also need time to manage offices, probation or community corrections.
“When I first became a judge, I sort of thought that I’d kind of sit in my ivory tower to make decisions. But the administrative tasks that you undergo … there’s a lot,” Spitzer said.
For example, an HVAC outage in his courthouse or a conversation with someone interested in opening a sober living home. 
“None of that’s case-related time, but it’s really important for us to do as judges,” Spitzer said.

With Governor Rick Snyder and then-State Superintendent Brian Whiston, we built a broad coalition of more than 300 leaders across business, labor, education, and economic development. Together, we helped students gain the skills needed to pursue successful careers while providing employers with the talent they needed to grow.
That comprehensive, statewide approach worked. But today, Michigan’s skills gap is once again widening, and the stakes are higher than ever.
Labor force participation stands at just 61.6%, below the national average of 62.3%. Thousands of our high school graduates leave each year for opportunities in other states. Without coordinated, long-term action, Michigan risks losing not only our future workforce but also the vitality and competitiveness of our economy.
This is why the recent Michigan House budget is so concerning. By eliminating funding for critical apprenticeship programs, the Going PRO Talent Fund, and $5.7 million in funding for Youth Solutions and its Jobs for Michigan’s Graduates (JMG) program, lawmakers are jeopardizing proven strategies that connect individuals to opportunity and employers to talent. What’s more concerning is that these are the exact programs lawmakers should be doubling down on because they prioritize training Michigan residents and investing in small businesses instead of chasing large out-of-state projects that rarely come to fruition.
Youth Solutions is a statewide nonprofit that impacts more than 14,000 young people in 98 communities each year through our three service lines: Jobs for Michigan’s Graduates (JMG), Youth Solutions Foundations, and Connecting Careers to the Core. JMG, our flagship program, directly serves 5,370 youth annually, equipping them with the tools, confidence, and skills they need to succeed after high school.
And these programs work. Over 16 years, JMG has consistently delivered outcomes well above the state average:

99% high school graduation rate
94% of youth engaged in postsecondary education, employment, or the military after high school
64% pursuing further education leading to degrees, certifications, or apprenticeships

In partner schools implementing our Foundations model since 2022, career awareness and planning have increased by double digits — up to 49% in some areas.
These results are not only strong, but they are also efficient. For every $1 Michigan invests in JMG, Youth Solutions leverages at least another $1 from federal, private, and local sources — doubling the impact of taxpayer dollars.
And the long-term return on investment is immeasurable: fewer young people relying on social services or unemployment benefits, fewer entering the corrections system, and more contributing to a stronger economy.
But behind every number is a story. Take Nolan Henson, for example. Nolan first connected with JMG as a freshman in high school, unsure of what direction his life would take. With the guidance of his JMG Specialist, Matt Campbell, Nolan discovered more than a program — he found a community. Through JMG, he built his résumé, explored career aspirations, and engaged in volunteer opportunities. Most importantly, he found a network of mentors and peers that continued to support him well beyond high school.
Nolan quickly grew from participant to leader. He helped launch Youth Solutions’ Youth Advisory Council, giving young people a voice in shaping the very services designed to support them. Inspired by the quote, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree 100 years ago,” Nolan came to see JMG as that tree — a foundation planted by mentors who believed in the power of youth. After high school, he pursued degrees in public and nonprofit administration and sociology, with a minor in leadership. Today, Nolan is Grants Manager at the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Flint, continuing his passion for youth development and community impact. He also serves on Youth Solutions’ board of directors, guiding the very organization that once guided him.
Eliminating funding for these programs means eliminating opportunities for youth like Nolan. It weakens the talent pipeline that employers rely on, and it undermines Michigan’s ability to compete for business investment and growth. As Michigan’s elected officials work to pass a bipartisan state budget ahead of the October 1st deadline, I hope they prioritize those programs that help train Michigan residents for good-paying careers, fund programs that help mainstreet over Wall Street, and pay special attention to our small businesses who are in desperate need of a skilled workforce to be able to compete in the global economy.
Michigan has a choice: we can divest from proven solutions and watch our talent gap widen, or we can recommit to smart, coordinated investments in career-focused education and workforce development. The answer should be clear and bipartisan: Let’s build a future where every Michigander is prepared for good-paying jobs, where small businesses have the skilled workforce they need to grow, compete, and succeed and where young people can stay and thrive in Michigan.

Angie Craig speaks at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party booth at the Minnesota State Fair on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Weaving through the crowded thoroughfare of the Minnesota State Fair, U.S. Rep. Angie Craig spotted her potential Republican opponent in the 2026 race for U.S. Senate, Royce White, who towered over the crowd in an “Alligator Alcatraz” hat and “Jesus is King” tee shirt. 
Craig darted over to White with staff, security and media in tow. She reached out for a handshake. White declined. 
“We’re done with the nice politics,” White said, launching into a rant about the security of voting machines.
“This isn’t who we are as Minnesotans,” Craig interrupted. 
But what if it is?
Craig, who has represented the south metro in the U.S. House since 2019, is balancing her party’s fight against President Donald Trump with a desire to find common ground with her Republican colleagues. She’s banking on the idea that Minnesotans want a senator who will be a counterforce to the political polarization that has defined Congress in recent decades. 
Her primary opponent is Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is running to Craig’s left and promising to take a no-compromise approach to governing and especially opposing Trump.
Craig handed out Sweet Martha’s cookies at the Republicans’ State Fair booth, held town halls in Republican districts and touted her bipartisan work on agriculture, immigration and public safety at Farmfest; simultaneously, she ramped up her anti-Trump messaging and criticized the GOP’s giant tax bill that will increase health care costs and cut federal spending on food aid.

She explains her approach in a metaphor: one hand open, and the other closed in a fist. 
“We have to have a hand extended and start listening to the voters who’ve left the Democratic Party to better understand why they’ve left. And then we have to have a fist closed, fighting a trillion dollars in Medicaid cuts or fighting $186 billion in SNAP cuts,” Craig said. “We have to be able to do both at the same time.”
From the South to the House
Craig grew up in mobile homes in eastern Arkansas. Her mom and grandmother raised her, and at times the family relied on food assistance to get by, Craig said. 
She attended the University of Memphis, where she studied journalism and was the editor of the student newspaper. After graduation, she spent a few years reporting on schools and local government before transitioning to corporate communications. 
For whatever her bipartisan bona fides, Craig was on the front lines of the nation’s culture war decades ago, and with the highest stakes imaginable.

In 1997, Craig and her former partner were involved in a lawsuit over the custody of a child they planned to adopt. The child’s biological grandparents also wanted custody, and a Tennessee court would decide which couple would get the baby. The infant’s biological mother wanted to give the child to Craig and her partner, but the grandparents argued in court that Craig and her partner were unfit to be parents because of their “lesbian lifestyle.”
An appeals court ruled 2-1 that Craig and her partner should take custody of the child. (Craig and that partner split in 2006 and shared custody; Craig married her wife Cheryl in 2008, and they have four sons and three grandchildren.)
Craig moved to St. Paul in 2005 to take a job with St. Jude Medical, now Abbott Laboratories.
She ran for Congress for the first time in 2016, narrowly losing to Republican then-U.S. Rep. Jason Lewis. Craig beat Lewis in 2018, and grew her margin of victory over the years, winning her most recent re-election by 13 points. 
Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District includes some Twin Cities suburbs — Woodbury, Eagan, Shakopee — and stretches down to Northfield and nearly Mankato. Her district’s demographics largely mirror the racial and educational breakdown of the state as the whole, and it contains urban, suburban and rural areas.
Her approach to legislating has been representative of the purple district she comes from — in 2023, she was among the top 20% of House members in the Lugar Index, a measure of bipartisanship among members of Congress, compiled by Georgetown University and The Lugar Center, a think tank founded by the old-school Indiana Republican Richard Lugar. 
Rep. Angie Craig speaks with supporters at the Minnesota State Fair on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)
Her pitch to voters has three tenets: addressing the affordability crisis, improving public safety and reforming Washington. 
“Everybody’s sick of Washington. Like, I just got there, and I’m trying to change it, and have been since I walked through the door,” Craig said. 
She supports banning members of Congress from trading stocks, flying first class and becoming lobbyists when they leave Congress. She also wants to ban gerrymandering, establish an independent redistricting commission in every state and reduce the influence of corporate money in politics, she said.
Craig frequently co-sponsors bills with Republicans — this is the basis of the Lugar Index — and has broken with the majority of her caucus on immigration, border security and law enforcement. She was among the 95 House Democrats (out of 213) who voted for a recent resolution in honor of Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on Sept. 10. 
Craig was one of 48 House Democrats, and the only Democratic member of Congress from Minnesota, to vote in favor of the Laken Riley Act, which requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain and deport immigrants arrested or charged with certain crimes. It was the first bill President Donald Trump signed into law during his second term. 
She was also among the first handful of Democrats in Congress to call on former President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.
JoAnn Pasternack, who has volunteered for every one of Craig’s campaigns, including her loss in 2016, said she appreciates the way Craig listens to her constituents, including the farmers around the state she represents as the Democratic ranking member on the House agriculture committee.
“You don’t get things done by being way to the left and fighting with everybody, including your own party,” Pasternack said. “You’ve got to listen, you’ve got to work with people. You’ve got to give and take, because compromise is a good thing.”
‘We are in a war when it comes to winning elections’
Craig was the lone Democrat among crypto executives and Republican lawmakers in Jackson Hole in August, where crypto boosters including Eric Trump gathered to discuss energy infrastructure and regulatory policy.
The House agriculture committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates digital commodities like cryptocurrencies along with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Craig appeared on a panel titled: “Seeking CLARITY: A Bipartisan Discussion on Market Structure.”
She “told the audience that inviting digital assets into the financial system should be apolitical,” the American Prospect reported. “Her presence on the cusp of an expensive campaign suggested otherwise.”
The biggest outside spender in Craig’s 2024 re-election campaign was a crypto-backed PAC called FairShake, which poured nearly $1 million into the race in support of Craig.
Craig has said publicly that “we can no longer wait to regulate digital assets,” and that she opposes the president’s involvement in crypto schemes.
Brookings Institution Fellow Tonantzin Carmona recently warned what may be coming: “When regulation is relaxed and industry gains political influence, risk-taking often escalates, and the public ends up paying the price.”

Craig’s opponent in the Democratic primary, Flanagan, has pledged not to accept donations from corporate political action committees, or PACs. 
Craig isn’t doing that. 
“I’m not going to tie one hand behind my back,” she said. “We are in a war when it comes to winning elections right now. We can’t stop them if we don’t win.”
Dave Wellstone, son of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, has refurbished his father’s iconic green campaign bus and plans to use it to support Craig. He’s friends with Flanagan, he said — Flanagan cites the elder Wellstone as one of her political mentors and inspirations.
So why bring the bus out for Craig? 
“I watched her outperform the rest of the ticket in a district that was tough. I’ve watched how we’ve lost a lot of Democrats in this state — namely the Iron Range in outstate Minnesota — to the Republicans, and they should be ours,” Wellstone said. “I think she can win.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1241668-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

Blackledge says he prides himself on his skill and good patient care, and that critics have harassed him and his staff.","After years of being ridiculed for her prominent nose, Marisa Hankins decided to undergo plastic surgery. 
“My whole entire life, I was made fun of for it,” said the 44-year-old hairstylist from Biloxi.

But the relief she felt after the 2021 rhinoplasty was short-lived. Less than a year later, a stitch inside her body ruptured through the skin’s surface and the area below it caved in, leaving a dimple at the end of her nose. 
Her surgeon, Dr. Adair Blackledge of Blackledge Face Center in Jackson, offered to correct the issue – going as far as volunteering to drive three hours to Biloxi on a weekend to look at it. But Hankins said she decided she didn’t feel comfortable receiving further medical care from him.

Hankins was wary of some aspects of her surgery, she said — how rushed the procedure felt, the oral sedative medications she was given that did not kick in until after surgery was over, and the “excruciating pain” she felt taking out her stitches using the staple remover Blackledge sent home with her. She had already returned to Jackson twice for minor issues.
“It was a very valuable lesson in vanity,” said Hankins, who uses movie special effects makeup to cover the cavity.
“You go there to get something fixed that you don’t like about yourself,” she said. “And then, they make it worse.” 
Hankins is not the only patient who has voiced concerns about the care Blackledge gave. In interviews with Mississippi Today, six others said they experienced prominent scarring or sought medical attention for wounds or complications after surgeries performed by Blackledge. They recounted quick procedures, results that didn’t last and repeated revisions, or procedures to correct or improve past surgeries.

Mississippi Today spoke to other patients with similar concerns who declined to be named because they did not want people to know they had cosmetic surgeries or said they felt embarrassed. 
Blackledge, a well-known facial plastic surgeon who has practiced in the Jackson area for 22 years, told Mississippi Today for months that he could not locate a written transfer agreement he said he had with St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson. Such an agreement is a state requirement for surgeons who sedate their patients in their offices, and an agreement is widely considered a critical patient safety measure for office-based surgery.
The agreements lay out a plan for transportation and treatment of patients at a hospital in case of medical complications or emergencies.
Meredith Bailess, a spokesperson for St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, said on Aug. 20 the hospital did not have a transfer agreement with Blackledge Face Center and was unable to locate an older agreement.
Blackledge provided a written transfer agreement with St. Dominic to Mississippi Today on Tuesday, signed that day, after Mississippi Today inquired about it for the third time in three months.
He has not faced any public disciplinary action by the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure, the state agency that licenses and regulates physicians. 
Over the past year, Blackledge has faced an onslaught of patient complaints on social media. Some patients, including Hankins, said they believed they were uniquely unfortunate until they discovered online that others had similar experiences.
In emails responding to questions from Mississippi Today, Blackledge described the past year as a “social media barrage,” in which he, his family and his staff members have been attacked and threatened by patients.

“I believe that what set all this off was a person who considered herself a social media influencer who was initially positive and then turned negative and began the frenzy against me,” he said. 
Blackledge said he believes the treatment he provided to the patients interviewed for this article met the standard of care expected of a facial plastic surgeon, and emphasized that they represent only a small portion of his patient population.
“The past year has been an extremely frustrating one for me, and I really feel like I am being painted in a false light by patients who had apparently unreasonable expectations of the results that could be achieved,” he said.
Blackledge said his commitment to patient privacy has prevented him from responding publicly to accusations made about his practice, but he does his best to treat every patient the way he would want a physician to treat him or a family member.
“When you contacted our clinic, it was actually a relief to me that I would finally be able to tell a limited version of my side of this story,” he said to Mississippi Today.
Blackledge’s training and credentials
There are few requirements for doctors to practice facial plastic surgery in Mississippi. Across the U.S., licensed physicians are given the leeway to practice any specialty of their choosing.
Some opt to gain additional, elective credentialing to certify their training in a specialty field. About 90% of U.S. physicians opt to become board certified, which requires that doctors complete an accredited residency program, pass an examination and do continuing education throughout their careers to maintain their certification. 
Board certification is not required, but some experts argue it is an important measure to consider when choosing a plastic surgeon or assessing their qualifications.
Blackledge began his career with a residency at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in otolaryngology, a surgical subspecialty focused on the ears, nose and throat. Part of the program was devoted solely to facial plastic and reconstructive training, he said. 
Some otolaryngologists, or ENTs, go on to practice facial plastic surgery, which is itself a subspecialty of otolaryngology. But Blackledge said he chose not to pursue board certification in otolaryngology because he was advised to distance himself from the field when he was starting out as a facial plastic surgeon.

“I simply am not an otolaryngologist and do not think it would be fair to the field of otolaryngology or myself for me to be board certified in that field,” he said, citing the fact that he has not inserted ear tubes, performed a tonsillectomy, removed head and neck cancer or performed sinus surgery since his residency. 
Board certification improves patient safety by showing that a doctor has trained extensively in a field and demonstrated they are capable of performing certain procedures, said Dr. Ben McIntyre, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the director of its plastic surgery residency program. McIntyre is board certified in general surgery and plastic surgery.
“Physicians, we have a great duty to practice good medicine, safe medicine, and not harm patients by not doing things that we’re not approved or credentialed to do or have no training in,” McIntyre said. 
McIntyre, like all of the physicians interviewed for this story, spoke generally about plastic surgery, but did not comment on Blackledge’s practice. 
The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure administrative code states that physicians performing office-based surgery “must be able to document satisfactory completion of surgical training such as Board certification or Board eligibility,” neither of which Blackledge holds. The board did not respond to questions about what other certifications are acceptable.
Blackledge said his residency and fellowship training clearly document extensive training in facial plastic surgery. He advertises himself as a fellowship-trained facial plastic surgeon.
Blackledge spent the year after his residency doing a fellowship in facial plastic surgery with Dr. E. Gaylon McCollough of Gulf Shores, Alabama. 
He said he took and passed the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery examination in 2003 after his fellowship, but he did not gain the credential because applicants must first be certified in otolaryngology or plastic surgery. Both fields are recognized by the primary organization that certifies specialty boards in the U.S., while facial plastic surgery is not.
Physicians must also submit a record of at least two years’ clinical experience and 100 operative reports for peer review in order to become board certified in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.
Blackledge said he also shadowed Dr. Frank Kamer of Beverly Hills, California, for two weeks in 2003. 
He returned to Jackson in 2003 to practice facial plastic surgery with Dr. George J. Smith of Faces PLLC. In the early years of his career, from about 2003 to 2009, the company’s website represented Blackledge as a board-certified facial plastic surgeon, according to web archives of the page.
Blackledge told Mississippi Today he was unaware the website represented him as such and had no part in its development. In 2009, his practice and Smith’s separated. Smith died in 2023. 
There are few regulations guiding what procedures a doctor can or cannot perform in their office or what credentials they must hold, said Dr. Heather Faulkner, a board certified general and plastic surgeon and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine who chairs the American Society of Plastic Surgeons’ patient safety committee. 
Many hospitals and insurance companies require doctors to be board-certified to gain hospital privileges or register as providers. But neither is required for office-based, elective surgeries paid in cash, she said, which places the onus on patients to evaluate doctors’ training and certifications. 
“There’s a hard stop (in hospitals), but in a private office, there’s no hard stop there,” Faulkner said. “And there’s no law that says that you can’t practice a specialty that you’re not trained in.” 
Speedy surgeries, no general anesthesia
From his office on Lakeland Drive, Blackledge performed 719 surgeries in 2024, according to a post on his Instagram page. He told Mississippi Today that he has performed 12,000 facelifts and rhinoplasties – a pace of at least two such procedures per working day – in his 22-year career. 
Courtney Sampson, now 42, traveled from Colorado for a deep plane facelift focused on the lower cheek and neck with Blackledge in 2024. She was surprised by the time it took Blackledge to complete the procedure – about an hour and 15 minutes, according to medical records she shared with Mississippi Today.
The deep plane facelift, a procedure that has risen in popularity in recent years, repositions the layer of fat, muscle and fascia below the skin by releasing it from retaining ligaments. Doctors describe it as an aggressive technique that yields more natural-looking results than traditional skin lifts but carries risks due to proximity to facial nerves.

Patient records show Hankins’ rhinoplasty and a facelift, which were performed in one sitting, took 65 minutes total. Other patient records reviewed by Mississippi Today showed a neck lift completed in 40 minutes and facelift and brow lift in an hour and 20 minutes. Each procedure involved different techniques and parts of the face. 
It takes the average plastic surgeon a little over four hours to perform a facelift, said Dr. Alan Matarasso, a board-certified New York plastic surgeon and president of the Plastic Surgery Foundation, a research and education organization affiliated with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 
Three other plastic surgeons interviewed for this story estimated that the average facelift takes about four to five hours. 
Blackledge said there is no way to compare the amount of time a facelift takes to another because each one involves different techniques and areas of the face. The patient’s weight and age, staff’s skill level, whether general anesthesia is used and whether a surgery is a revision are all factors that influence the amount of time a procedure takes. 
A procedure like Sampson’s, which was focused on the lower cheek and neck, can take less time than a full facelift, he said. 
Blackledge said he was taught that taking more than two hours for a facelift suggests a lack of technical skill and can lead to more complications. He said he believes he is well above the “average plastic surgeon,” both in terms of where he trained and the number of procedures he has performed, adding that ENTs who focus solely on facial plastic surgery may be more efficient than plastic surgeons who perform other procedures. 
“I do not believe that there should be a specific time it takes to perform a facelift,” he said. 
Blackledge performs major surgeries, including facelifts, without general anesthesia. He instructs some patients to remove their staples themselves. For patients who have traveled to Mississippi, he does post-operative visits at their hotel rooms. 
Some surgeons employ these practices, but they aren’t common, said McIntyre, the director of UMMC’s plastic surgery residency program.
Blackledge said he prefers not to completely sedate his patients so they can follow commands and move their mouths during surgery, which allows him to see tissue position and avoid important nerves. He said he administers local anesthetics where he plans to make incisions, and in a minority of cases – about 10% – he inserts an IV, primarily for fluids. 
The medical community is divided on the safety of this method. Some plastic surgeons say this method can be safe, while others caution against it for complex procedures, like facelifts. 
“Most surgeons are going to want to do (facelifts) in an operating room under general anesthesia,” McIntyre said. Operating on the face poses risks of nerve damage and bleeding, he said, and sudden patient movement could lead to injury of the mouth, nose or throat. 
Matarasso said general anesthesia is not always necessary for procedures like facelifts, but recommended monitoring by an anesthesiologist for patient safety and comfort. 
Blackledge said he believes general anesthesia increases the likelihood of risks, complications and dissatisfaction because a plastic surgeon can’t determine if he or she is getting close to nerves or if the surgery is causing asymmetry when a patient is unresponsive. He said it also has a greater risk of injury to the throat. 
Several patients told Mississippi Today they chose Blackledge’s practice specifically because he does not use general anesthesia. 
Blackledge uses a sleeping pill and a sedative, anti-anxiety medication – Ambien and Valium – to sedate most patients before surgery, a drug combination he said he has used his entire career. 
The regimen “provides pain control while allowing the patient to be conscious and responsive as well as relaxed in which could otherwise be a harrowing experience,” he said. 
McIntyre warned that combining sleeping pills with sedatives could dangerously depress the central nervous system. The combination can be difficult to control because the absorption of oral medications varies by patient, and the effects can peak after surgery – when patients are no longer being monitored – potentially making it difficult for them to breathe. 
Dr. Gianfranco Frojo is a board-certified Virginia plastic surgeon currently serving as one of the directors of The Aesthetic Foundation, the research arm of The Aesthetic Society, who has studied the use of oral sedation and local anesthesia for a limited facelift technique. 
He said he does not recommend using oral sedation for complex procedures, like deep plane facelifts, because there is a greater risk of damage to facial nerves. He said he doesn’t currently use the method in any facelift he performs.
He said he has never heard of sleeping pills being used for preoperative sedation and warned that patients could fall asleep, making it more difficult to protect the airway.
“I would be very alarmed if someone was prescribing Ambien for patients prior to procedures that they need to be awake for,” he said. 
Blackledge said he was trained using this regimen and monitors respirations and oxygen levels throughout surgeries, which is documented in medical records. He said he has never had an adverse event related to anesthesia administration.
Blackledge said the medications he administers, which have been shown to cause amnesia, may have led some patients to misremember parts of their surgeries. 
Four patients told Mississippi Today they did not recall changing out of their clothes and into a surgical gown for their surgeries.
It’s typical for patients to change into a surgical gown before complex procedures to minimize the chance of infection, McIntyre said.
Sampson, who received a facelift from Blackledge in 2024, arrived wearing a zip-up sweatshirt. She said she was conscious for most of the surgery but does not remember changing into a gown. 
After the surgery, the hood of her sweatshirt was covered in blood, she recalled. A photograph of Sampson taken 10 minutes after surgery shows her recovering in the sweatshirt. 
Blackledge said his nurse and surgical assistants change patients into surgical gowns after they have been sedated and help them back into their clothes after surgery. 
Frojo said patients typically change into gowns themselves before surgery begins. 
“When the patient is sedated, the surgery should be happening, and nothing else,” he said. 
‘You’ll be shocked’ 
Blackledge’s website casts him as an out-of-the-ordinary doctor who sets himself apart with a personal approach to patient care.
“You’ll be shocked when he responds to your texts, even after-hours,” reads the site. “You’ll be thankful when he visits your home or hotel to change your dressing after your facelift. Call him crazy, call him obsessive, call him the consummate Southern gentleman: Adair Blackledge will transform your expectations of facial aesthetics and patient care.”
Blackledge said he has operated a charity since 2008 providing free removal of tattoos from sex trafficking survivors and free removal of gang-related tattoos from formerly incarcerated men. 
He has over 20,000 followers on Facebook.
Blackledge said his availability to patients before and after surgery and his willingness to accommodate them financially sets him apart from other physicians. 
Kellie James, now 56, traveled from Sugar Land, Texas, for a lower face and neck lift with Blackledge in 2022. The quotes she received for surgery in the Houston area were more than double Blackledge’s. More importantly, she said, she was impressed with the before and after photographs posted on his social media.
She said she appreciated Blackledge’s bedside manner and availability after surgery. She returned to Blackledge for another procedure in 2023 and said she would recommend him to a friend. 
“He literally turned me back about 20 years, in my opinion,” she said. 
Patients also said they were drawn to Blackledge’s charming personality and ability to remember details about them, which made them trust and feel comfortable around him.
But some said they felt they had not asked enough questions or did not understand all the risks. 
Some said they expected to be more sedated than they were, remember crying out in pain, were surprised by the location of incisions or staples, or did not expect Blackledge to use staples, rather than sutures, in certain areas of their face. 
Blackledge said he spends a significant amount of time with patients in consultations, ensuring they are a reasonable candidate for the procedure and they understand the risks and where incisions will be made. He said he recommends surgery to less than two-thirds of the patients he consults with and marks on patients before surgery begins. 
Summer Price, now 47, traveled from Denver in 2023 for a facelift and brow lift with Blackledge after reading good reviews on social media. She said she was initially happy with the result, which made her look much younger, and she recommended Blackledge’s practice to several friends.

But she said she was concerned with the placement of her incisions and staples. 
They did not match the drawing Blackledge provided to her, which showed a few stitches hidden in her hairline and others placed behind her ears but concealed by hair. But the incision behind her ears draped about an inch below her hairline, and there were more staples than she expected.
“So many staples – staples upon staples upon staples,” she said. “There was no rhyme or reason.” 
A year and a half later, pearly white scars trailed along Price’s hairline, wrapped around her ears and extended behind them, with white scars dotting areas where staples were placed, photographs show. Her face initially appeared lifted but had mostly returned to its previous appearance after four months, she said.

Price said the placement of her scars was debilitating, and she has undergone several scar camouflage tattoo sessions. She stopped wearing her hair up, and didn’t go to the gym for a year and a half because of embarrassment. She doesn’t socialize as frequently as she used to and struggles with a crippling anxiety that she might make the wrong decision. 
“I can’t move on from it, because it’s a constant reminder,” she said. 
Blackledge said the pictures he has of Price’s scars show an “extremely reasonable result” and emphasized that she was initially satisfied and recommended his practice to friends.
He said that there is no way to avoid the potential of excessive scar formation in any surgical procedure and said he uses techniques during surgery and post-operatively, like creams, to avoid and address scarring. 
Frojo, the Virginia plastic surgeon who is one of the directors of The Aesthetic Foundation, said facelift scars are planned to be hidden and shouldn’t be identifiable by someone who doesn’t know they are there. Placing incisions at natural transitions in a person’s skin and proper tension can prevent noticeable scarring, he said. 
Most red or sensitive scarring matures within a year, said McIntyre. Abnormal scars, like keloids and hypertrophic scars, may take longer. 
Patients signed consent forms, which are typical for such surgeries, acknowledging they discussed the potential risks and complications with Blackledge, including scarring, infection and numbness, that no results were guaranteed and that in rare instances, a revisionary procedure might be required. 
“These consent forms constitute documentary proof of the consent process, because memories fade with time, especially when a patient has a result that is less than she was hoping for,” Blackledge said.
Exempt from scrutiny
Anna Ford, now 34, of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, was full of excitement the day of her surgery to slim her nose with Blackledge in 2020. Her nose had troubled her for years, and the procedure was financially out of reach for her in nearby St. Louis, where she said cosmetic plastic surgery is costly. 
Her nose was fuller than she had hoped after the procedure with Blackledge, but he offered to revise it at no charge. 
After returning to Mississippi in 2021 for a revision surgery, Ford’s nose became red and swollen in winter months and she said she occasionally caught whiffs of a “foul odor.” She said she felt chronically fatigued and depressed.

Nearly three years after the procedure, her nose darkened and became inflamed for weeks before an abscess in her nose burst, leaving an indentation that remains at the tip of her nose today. She said she then realized that the smell had been coming from inside her nose. 
“It smelled like death,” she said. 
Ford’s revision occurred six days after Hankins’, the rhinoplasty patient who now uses special effects makeup to cover the cavity at the end of her nose. Both women experienced sutures bursting through their skin and have a similar indentation at the tip of the nose.  
A slew of doctors’ appointments revealed that Ford had a chronic infection inside her nose. This spring, she underwent surgery to remove the infection after multiple rounds of antibiotics failed to clear it. When it persisted, an infectious disease specialist recommended inserting a long-term intravenous line to deliver antibiotics over a period of weeks. 
Three days after it was inserted, she said she felt her energy return. “I was like, ‘Is this what normal people feel like?’” she said. “I was so sick for so long and thought it was depression the whole time. But it was an infection.”

Ford said she has had no feeling in her nose since the 2021 surgery. 
Blackledge said Ford removed her bandages sooner than she was instructed to, which resulted in a defect in her skin. He said he could not speak to the subsequent issues Ford has faced, but noted that every surgical procedure carries the risk of infection.
“The fact that an infection occurred post-operatively is not proof of inappropriate care,” he said.
He said Ford sent an intimidating message threatening “karma” to one of his nurses, an example of the “mob mentality” of unhappy patients he has faced. Ford said she sent the message because she is angry and thinks he and his staff are responsible for the infection.
Other patients who spoke to Mississippi Today said they experienced various side effects after surgery, including noticeable scarring, a cheek implant bursting through the skin, a loss of feeling in the neck that has lasted five years, scars that badly itch, and wounds that opened and required further medical attention. 
Every surgery carries the risk of complications, or health problems that arise after a procedure. A recent review of 59 scientific articles studying rates of complications in facelifts indicated that unfavorable scarring is the most common and occurs in about 5% of cases. 
About 3% of rhinoplasties result in complications, including abscesses, infection and adverse esthetic outcomes, and 15% of patients have revisions, according to a recent paper studying complication rates in rhinoplasties.
Blackledge said he believes his complication rate is far below the national average. 
“Given the recognized complication rate in various facial plastic procedures, and the number of procedures I perform each year, I understand there will be patients who are not happy with their result,” Blackledge said. “But that is true for every doctor, regardless of the field.”
He said many problems, like redness and numbness, are not unusual and can be corrected with additional treatments or heal with time. He said he discusses the possibility of undesired scars with each patient and has no recollection of receiving a complaint about an implant bursting through the skin. 
Implants and stitches bursting through the skin occur very rarely, but do happen, McIntyre said. 
Blackledge said he has never been sued in 22 years of medical practice. Mississippi Today searched state and federal court records and could not locate any suits filed against Blackledge pertaining to patient care. 
There is little comprehensive research that clearly demonstrates how frequently cosmetic facial plastic surgery patients are dissatisfied or make complaints after their procedures. One recent article studying a sample of 2,000 patient reviews on social media showed about 8% of reviews were negative, with most citing dissatisfaction with the outcome.
Research shows that high volumes of patient complaints can predict higher rates of medical complications and legal suits, said Dr. Scott Hultman, director of the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery at WakeMed Health and Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina. Hultman has conducted research on unsolicited patient complaints made about surgeons to hospitals. 
Hospitals can use complaint data to intervene and modify surgeons’ behavior, he said. But there are few avenues for patients to make formal complaints in office-based surgery settings, where private practice surgeons are generally exempt from such oversight. 
“That’s one of the loopholes in medicine,” he said. “…They often will escape scrutiny for a while until enough patients complain or there’s a malpractice case.” 
Blackledge said there are several avenues for patients to make complaints, including lawsuits and to government agencies. 
‘You’re just wanting them to fix it and fix it’ 
Vicky Pitts, now 55, underwent a neck lift with Blackledge in 2020. Weeks after the procedure, the Laurel resident said she noticed her face drop. 
“Everything went sour,” said Pitts, who said it appeared her surgery resulted in no change in her appearance. She reached out to Blackledge about her concerns, beginning a string of revisions and touch-up surgeries that occurred for more than two years.

One study estimates that early relapses after facelift surgery occur in about 2% of cases.
Blackledge said his facelifts are conservative and he explains to patients he can always revise them – at no charge – if they are not pleased. He said because adverse outcomes can happen, he makes himself as available as possible to his patients. 
He said he also pays for patients’ flights and accommodations for revisions. 
“I have done this for over ten years and believe patients appreciate it,” Blackledge said.

Pitts said she was grateful that Blackledge provided the revisions free of charge, because she couldn’t afford to go to another surgeon after paying for the original procedure.
But some of her revisions came with their own problems, she said. On several occasions, her stitches popped out, leaving incisions gaping open. Once, she went to urgent care to have a wound sutured again. 
It was difficult for Pitts to explain why she kept returning, even when she kept experiencing difficulties and wasn’t seeing the results she wanted. She said she felt vulnerable. 
“You’re just wanting them to fix it and fix it,” she said.
Social media brushfire
Scores of alleged patients of Blackledge have shared stories and photographs of their surgery experiences in a members-only Facebook group created in 2023. 
The concerned patients began reaching a wider audience early this year after sharing images on a public Instagram page that now has over 12,000 followers. Price, an administrator of the page, said she received dozens of messages from former patients. 
“It was like a brushfire,” she said. “I couldn’t even keep up.”
Blackledge said he faced no issues regarding his practice until the social media attacks from the past year. 
“I didn’t suddenly forget how to do what I was trained to do, and the process and protocols for patient care that I have been using successfully for over 20 years and 12,000 procedures didn’t suddenly become ineffective,” he said. 
He said he located social media posts and pictures from people who have never been his patients and that many made inaccurate and disparaging comments. 
Some patients said the Facebook group helped them feel less alone.
“I was glad that he didn’t just single me out, because that’s how I felt for the longest,” said Jill Hamilton, now 47, from Nashville, who said she endured discomfort in her face for over a year after Blackledge inserted cheek implants during a 2023 facelift revision surgery with Blackledge – her third revision with him. One implant burst through her skin in 2024, she said. 
Blackledge said he was never contacted by Hamilton about the implant bursting through her skin. 
On social media, patients encouraged one another to make formal complaints about their care with Blackledge to the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure.
State medical boards are often one of the only places to lodge complaints against office-based surgeons who are not board-certified, Hultman said, because there is no hospital or credentialing board to which complaints can be reported. It can also be a longer, more cumbersome process.
Price said she was interviewed earlier this year by the board after she submitted a complaint. But five other patients told Mississippi Today their complaints were dismissed by the board or they did not receive a response. 
In an email, board attorney Paul Barnes declined to say whether the board is investigating any of the complaints, citing its policy not to comment on pending investigations. Complaints are not public record while a disciplinary investigation is pending and remain confidential if no action is taken. 
Sampson, who traveled to Mississippi for a facelift last year, said she saw little change in her appearance and has “horrible scars” from her procedure. Her experience has caused her to lose trust in the medical system, which she believes has done too little to protect her and other patients.
She said it feels that rather than being taken seriously for their claims, she and other patients have been deemed vindictive for sharing their stories. 
“That is not the case at all,” she said. “I just don’t want this to continue happening.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22163220/Blackledge-Face-Center-FeatImage-06.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

[…]","Missouri's First Lady Claudia Kehoe looks out at the crowd assembled Jan. 13 for her husband's inauguration as governor (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe’s political team is taking a lead role in the campaign to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion, enlisting key advisors and tapping First Lady Claudia Kehoe as treasurer.
Claudia Kehoe is the only officer listed in organization filings at the Missouri Ethics Commission for Her Health, Her Future PAC, created Sept. 9.
The campaign’s goal is to pass the measure placed on the ballot by lawmakers, which would repeal the amendment passed in November that restored abortion rights. The legislative proposal will appear on a 2026 statewide ballot as Amendment 3, the same name held by the previous abortion rights amendment. 
“The Her Health, Her Future PAC was launched with one clear and unwavering mission,” said Mike Hafner, who was an advisor to Kehoe’s gubernatorial campaign and who is now a campaign advisor for the PAC. “To defend the dignity of human life and ensure Missourians have the knowledge and necessary tools to stand boldly for the unborn.”
In November 2024, Missourians voted by a slim margin to legalize abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The new proposed amendment seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
A spokesperson for the governor’s office referred all comments to the PAC.
The governor and his wife have long opposed abortion. But Claudia Kehoe’s involvement in the campaign is notable nonetheless.
“I don’t recall in my over 40 years as pro-life lobbyist a first lady taking such a prominent role for any ballot measures – let alone a pro-life one,” said Sam Lee, who helped campaign against the 2024 abortion rights amendment.
Claudia Kehoe has the financial knowledge for her new role. She earned a bachelor’s degree in finance and a master’s degree in business administration. She went on to work in banking in the St. Louis area. 
Members of the anti-abortion movement hope that access to the governor’s bully pulpit will help propel early fundraising success. 
“I know that with (Claudia Kehoe’s) fervor, her energy, her strength, her contacts, that things are going to be a lot different than they were the last time,” said Kathy Forck, with 40 Days for Life. 
Last year, the campaign in support of the abortion rights amendment, called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, raised more than $31.5 million, raking in large donations from organizations including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, as well as from liberal groups including the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the Fairness Project and Open Source Action Fund, all based out of Washington D.C. 
Fundraising efforts among the anti-abortion movement last year were split among a handful of campaigns totaling less than $4 million in donations. A bulk of the fundraising was done in the final months before the election.
“Our opposition has proven to be very well-funded and very well-organized,” Hafner said. “This year our PAC is going to be very focused on early fundraising and organizing to make sure that spending disparity doesn’t exist at that level again.” 
Opponents of the abortion ban formed a campaign committee in May. Called Stop The Ban, it has taken over the website used by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and has the same treasurer, Mike Pridmore. No one involved with the campaign offered a comment on Kehoe’s role in the opposing campaign.
Hafner said the Kehoes intend to involve every anti-abortion group in the state that’s interested in collaborating. 
“Our work this cycle is laser-focused on informing, engaging and mobilizing Missourians early,” Hafner said, “to take action on one of the most consequential issues we will ever face in Missouri.”

If the union succeeds, children who rely on scholarships for tuition, learning therapies, or specialized instruction will face the very real possibility of losing access to the educational  lifelines that have helped them thrive. 
This summer, the MNEA chose courtroom power plays over student needs by targeting a $51  million state investment helping economically disadvantaged and special needs children access high-quality education outside their traditional public schools. By suing to block these funds, the union directly threatens over 7,000 new scholarships slated for this school year, nearly tripling  the reach of the program and finally ending years-long waits for children who need help now. 
If funding is blocked, families face painful choices: pay tuition out of pocket, drastically cut household spending, or send children (often with complex learning or physical challenges) back into environments that have failed them before. For working parents, school choice is the  difference between a child in second grade finally reading confidently or a student losing hard won academic progress. The union’s lawsuit ignores those stakes. Maintaining institutional control, in their view, is more important than the needs of Missouri families. 
School choice programs prioritize Missouri’s most vulnerable kids. Families use scholarships not just for private school tuition, but for tutoring, transportation, adaptive technology, and therapies. Blocking those options means denying access to tailored learning environments, sometimes after years of waiting for an opportunity that finally arrived this fall. 
More than a legal battle about taxpayer funding, the union’s lawsuit is a direct attack on  educational freedom for Missouri’s most vulnerable children and the parents who fight daily for  a better life. While union lawyers claim they’re defending constitutional principles, the impact falls squarely on the backs of families: children with reading disabilities or physical needs, single  mothers scraping together resources, and parents desperate for one more shot at helping their  kids succeed outside the standard system.
Recent national data paints a troubling picture for students, especially those already facing challenges. According to the latest release from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), students are struggling at unprecedented levels. The 2024 “Nation’s Report Card”  shows that average scores have declined since 2019 for twelfth graders in mathematics and reading, and for eighth graders in science (these scores were already trending downward even before the COVID shutdowns). 
Among high school seniors, the percentage scoring below the basic achievement level in both math and reading has reached the highest point since the assessments began, with nearly half of twelfth graders performing below basic in math and one in three below basic in reading. 
These results are sobering, as even federal officials admit, with the largest drops hitting lower performing students hardest and widening the gap between the lowest- and highest-achieving  students. Participation in hands-on science learning has also decreased, and absenteeism rates among twelfth graders are up sharply, with nearly a third missing three or more days of school in  the previous month. 
Against this bleak backdrop, school choice programs are more critical than ever for families  failed by the standard system. Fewer than one in four twelfth graders are performing at a  proficient level in math, and rates of college readiness in both reading and math have dropped  since 2019. For the poorest and most vulnerable (those with disabilities, those qualifying for free  lunch), school choice may be the only path to academic growth and confidence. 
Though the union claims to act in students’ interests, its actions tell the real story. 
The union’s  lawsuit would devastate families, removing hope and resources from those who need them most. To block these lifelines now would not just cut off opportunity, but actively worsen the crisis revealed in the Nation’s Report Card. Missouri’s policymakers and courts should heed its dire warnings and do everything in their power to support, not sabotage, direct investments in students most at risk of being left behind. As Missourians, we must unite to secure our kids’ future and shield them from the actions of those who would jeopardize it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/child-care2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831750463620-1.jpg,,,2025-09-24 06:57:07.782085

(StockPlanets/Getty Images)New Jersey school districts should move to limit students’ ability to use cellphones and other devices with internet access during instruction and other parts of the school day to limit classroom distractions, the state Department of Education says in a new report.
The recommendations — which include exceptions for emergencies, students’ individual education plans, and health monitoring, among some others — are likely to bolster a legislative push to limit student access to electronics that already boasts broad bipartisan support despite a monthslong stall.
“I think they are great recommendations, and the first thing I would say is it’s about time,” said Assemblyman Cody Miller (D-Gloucester), a prime sponsor of a bill that would require school districts to adopt some form of policy limiting students’ in-school phone access.
The guidance lays out three example policies. One would require school districts to hold students’ devices for the duration of the school day, a second would leave phones in students’ possession as long as they are unpowered and out of sight until the school day ends, and a third would be some version of the two that allows students to use their devices outside of classroom instruction.
It presents three options for schools to store student devices. Districts could use magnetically locked pouches, school lockers, or in-classroom storage to hold cellphones and other electronics.










Other states are moving at the speed of lightning, and personally, I feel we’re behind on this.


– Assemblyman Cody Miller (D-Gloucester)


Legislators and school officials have increasingly viewed internet-enabled electronics like smartphones and smartwatches as a source of distraction in the classroom and a conduit for cyberbullying.
“I talk to teachers all the time, educators all the time, and of course I’m a parent myself,” said Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris). “It’s the No. 1 distraction.”
School phone bans are not new. More than two dozen states, including neighboring New York, have enacted full or partial bans on cellphones in classrooms, and some New Jersey school districts have created their own prohibitions.
Jersey City’s school district — the third largest in the state by enrollment during the 2024-2025 school year — last week approved a ban that will bar students from using their cellphones in class beginning Oct. 1.
Legislative efforts to ban cellphones in schools have seen less success despite broad bipartisan support in both legislative chambers and support from Gov. Phil Murphy, who endorsed efforts to create phone-free schools in his annual state of the state address. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January after two terms.
Lawmakers earlier this year and in late 2024 unanimously advanced bills that would require school districts to draft their own phone bans that, at a minimum, were at least as strict as those called for by state guidance.
“It’s not necessarily a one-size-fits-all, nor should it be, even if we just talked about different grades and different needs, but the overall message is we need to address this,” said Dunn, a GOP co-sponsor of the bipartisan measure who has introduced her own phone ban bill.
Both bills would permit varying levels of restriction for different grade levels, and the state’s guidance recommends elementary school students be subject to the strictest rules, which would relax for middle schoolers and again for high school students.
Miller, who credited fellow sponsors Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) and Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester) for the bipartisan legislation, said he hopes the legislation advances swiftly.
“This is a priority for all of us. I know that it is. Other states are moving at the speed of lightning, and personally, I feel we’re behind on this,” he said. “We need to get this done and moved because we’re going to be moving into another school year.”
The Senate unanimously approved Miller’s bill in January, but it will need another vote to approve an amended version that came out of an Assembly committee in March.
The bill has yet to come to a floor vote in the lower chamber, and it’s not likely to see one there until after this year’s November elections. All 80 Assembly seats and the governorship are on the ballot.
The bill may see some opposition despite the broad support it enjoys among lawmakers. Students and some parents have raised concerns over how a phone ban might affect parents’ ability to reach students during an emergency.
Sponsors said new technologies mean parents’ ability to directly contact their children at school matters less.
“Districts now have the ability to communicate through text systems, through email systems where they’re able to communicate with the families during school hours if, God forbid,  something were to happen,” Miller said.

(Getty Images)Assembly Republicans proposed a package of bills they say would help increase affordable housing throughout Wisconsin on Tuesday. Rep. Rob Brooks (R-Saukville) said he hopes to build on the success of bills passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers in 2023. Those measures created and expanded state loan programs and were supported with over $500 million in state funds.  
At a news conference in the state Capitol Tuesday morning, Brooks said GOP lawmakers anticipate cooperation from the governor’s office once again. The authors have worked with Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) on many of the bills, he said, and have put the bills on a fast track with hearings to take place soon. 
“We hope to get out more affordable housing throughout the state, and when I refer to affordable housing, I want to be clear, we’re not talking about subsidized housing. We’re talking about affordable housing,” Brooks said. “What I’m talking about is the housing stock that was built just a generation or two ago. We’re talking about small ranch homes, some of those homes built without garages or alleyways or detached garages.” 
Seven bills were drafted as of Tuesday, but Brooks said there could be up to 10 in the final package. “It’s kind of a fluid process right now,” he said. 
According to the National Association of Realtors, in 2024 the average age of a first-time homebuyer in the U.S. reached an all-time high of 38, said Tom Larson, president and CEO of the Wisconsin Realtors Association. He said that the average price of a home in Wisconsin is $340,000, and that over the last 15 years, Wisconsin has built fewer housing units per capita than the national average. 
“Housing prices continue to rise faster than wages, and the longer it takes somebody to purchase a home, the longer it takes for them to build wealth, the longer it takes for them to establish roots in our community, which has a direct impact on our labor force and our economy,” Larson said. “Wisconsin’s [housing] affordability is worse than any of our surrounding neighbors. It’s worse than Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and Iowa.”
He said the Wisconsin real estate industry is “cautiously optimistic that the passage of these bills will help address Wisconsin’s affordability crisis.” 
New WHEDA programs 
One bipartisan bill, coauthored by Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) would create a Workforce Home Loan Program through the WHEDA. The bill has two Democratic coauthors as well: Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) and Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay).
Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), who is also an author on the home loan legislation, said the bill is intended to help Wisconsinites who want to become homeowners. 
“Instead of putting down roots, people have been stuck in renting situations and are unable to build equity or stability, so, how do we do that to help them get into that first step of home ownership?” Knodl asked rhetorically. 
The program would allow first-time home buyers access to second mortgage loans of up to $60,000 at 0% interest. The loans could be used to help with down payments and closing costs. Knodl said the repayment terms would be flexible and tailored to household income, and there would be the option to defer payments for low-income families.
He said that the program would sustain itself through the repayments borrowers make.
“Home ownership is about more than buying a house. It’s about building stronger communities, investing in schools and growing local economies,” Knodl said.
Another bill proposed by Rep. Dave Murphy (D-Greenville) would require the agency to establish a grant program to support developers who want to convert multifamily housing to condominiums. 
WHEDA would be required to direct $10 million from the Main Street Housing Rehabilitation revolving loan fund to the grant program, which would cover up to $50,000 in reasonable attorney fees, state and local permitting fees, and any other costs associated with the conversion. 
Changes to help speed up, support development
A handful of the Republicans’ proposals would change laws to support more development and  standardize the process for a variety of housing developments.
Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) has proposed creating residential tax increment districts, or TIDs. A TID is a financial tool  municipalities can use to designate certain areas for economic development and use the district’s property tax growth to help pay for improvements to the area. 
Armstrong said the TIDs are one of the biggest tools that municipalities have to do something about housing, and his bill would help address the biggest barrier to building more workforce housing — the cost of subdivision infrastructure, including sidewalks, curb and gutter, water, sewer and utilities. 
His bill would establish a “pay-as-you-go” TID, applying a portion of the tax increment from new homes  to offset the cost of subdivision development.
“In my area, a starter home is $400,000,” Armstrong said. “That’s not a starter home. That’s not what my workforce can afford.”
Armstrong also has a second bill that would require communities to align  comprehensive plans and the zoning ordinances. He said it would provide clarity and predictability for municipalities, builders and developers. 
Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) has authored a bill to provide a statewide framework for local regulations of “accessory dwelling units” — secondary housing units located on the same property as a primary residence. 
“Currently, Wisconsin lacks a unified approach, resulting in a confusing, patchwork of regulation that varies across local governments,” Goeben said. She said her bill “addresses that confusion” and gives property owners a pathway to add accessory units. “This legislation strikes a balance, ensuring individual property owners can efficiently add housing while maintaining reasonable community standards,” she said. 
According to the bill draft, local regulations would be allowed to limit the size and height of an accessory unit , require that a unit satisfy current setback and lot coverage requirements, and prohibit units built  after the effective date of the bill from being turned into short-term rentals.
Rep. Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond) is proposing a bill that would set out a process for local governments and developers seeking to build a subdivision, including providing an opportunity for developers to meet informally with local representatives before submitting plans. He said the bill is meant to place local governments and developers on the same page “from the beginning of the process all the way through to the end of the process.” 
“Over the next five years, we’re gonna probably need about 140,000 housing units in the state of Wisconsin. At the current pace, we’re not going to even get close,” Kriebich said. “Delays and miscommunication oftentimes leads to delays or no subdivisions whatsoever, so this will clean up that process and again allow some tweaks in statutes to fast track new home construction in the state of Wisconsin.”
Delay new building codes
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) is seeking to delay the deadline for the implementation of new codes for commercial and multi-family residential buildings. The code changes are the first major updates to the codes in over a decade, and are being implemented following a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that struck down lawmakers’ ability to indefinitely block administrative rules.
“Unfortunately, there was a recent Supreme Court ruling that will mandate that the new building code need to go into effect, and while we’re not here to prevent that, we need to have clarity as to when exactly that’s going to happen,” Penterman said. 
Currently, the Department of Safety and Professional Services has said that all commercial building plans submitted to DSPS for approval must meet the standards set in the upgraded code starting on Oct. 1, though the new code technically went into effect on Sept. 1.
Penterman has proposed a bill that would delay that requirement until April 2026. 
“This gives businesses, commercial buildings, residential housing and municipalities more time to review these plans, make sure everything’s all set to go,” Penterman said.

Columnist Rod Miller took an informal poll of friends across the political spectrum and heard a chorus of ""no.""
The post Would the Bill of Rights be ratified today? appeared first on WyoFile .","Our Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, is our most popular and familiar part of that cherished document. Asked to quote a passage from the Constitution, most folks would reply “right to bear arms” or “freedom of speech” or “due process.” Those rights and more are enshrined in the Bill of Rights.

Opinion

But, if presented to the nation in 2025, would the Bill of Rights have enough support to be ratified?
That’s the question I asked my circle of friends and frenemies in an informal telephone poll the other day. I sat on my sunny porch with Good Dog Henry, drinking PBR and taking the pulse of a passel of folks in both the public and private sectors vis-à-vis that question. I think my universe of friends pretty much covers the waterfront and most hues in the political spectrum, and none of them would try to blow smoke up my fundament. The answers I got didn’t surprise me.
The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and represented James Madison’s compromise with the Anti-Federalists (mostly in the southern states) who demanded a statement of individual rights as a condition of ratifying the new Constitution. Madison’s compromise saved the whole shebang, and we live under its wisdom today.
The Bill of Rights was patterned after the Magna Carta, which King John of England was forced to sign, which limited the “Divine Right of Kings” to have unchecked power over the people. Even though our Constitution instituted a republican form of government, Thomas Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists didn’t fully trust our new government to protect individual rights against federal power.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
So they demanded and got our Bill of Rights. God bless ‘em!
Good Dog Henry and I sat in the sunshine, scratching our noggins and wondering if that same level of statesmanship and citizenship could prevail today. That prompted my impromptu telephone poll to ask folks I respect to weigh in on the matter. What if the Bill of Rights didn’t exist? Would it pass into law today, given the current atmosphere in the United States?
Consider this: in 1791, the population of the United States was 3.9 million, while today our population is nearly a hundred times that. In 2025, there are around 350 million U.S. citizens living in an advanced techno-society and all connected by the internet. Things have changed since Madison’s time.
A constitutional amendment still requires a 2/3 vote in both houses of Congress, and if that succeeds, ratification by 3/4 of the states. In 1791, there were 13 states. Today, there are 50. The sheer numbers argue that the Bill of Rights would have a tougher time getting ratified today than it did back when our elected officials all wore wigs.
Add to that the demonstrable polarization in America today, and the equally demonstrable unwillingness to grant rights to folks we don’t like or agree with, and you have the atmosphere in which my poll was conducted.
Respondents to my porch poll pointed out that red states wouldn’t ratify the First Amendment (free speech and all that hippie stuff) and blue states wouldn’t ratify the Second Amendment (guns). The other eight amendments would be tussled over and pulled apart by the partisan and ideological divides that make it nearly impossible to get anything done in this country, let alone ratifying a Bill of Rights.
I’ll submit that, given recent pronouncements made by the Wyoming congressional delegation, the Bill of Rights as Madison wrote it, probably wouldn’t pass out of Congress to be presented to the people. One respondent to my poll pointed out that “Congress couldn’t even pass gas today.”
As I said, the answers I got didn’t surprise me. Only one person answered “yes.” There was one “maybe” and one “only by an act of God.” There were 30 or so firm “no way Joses.”
Before you make a snarky comment on this column, or discount my results, try it yourself. Call up a bunch of folks in your own circle, and ask them the same question. If your results differ from mine, then we have something to discuss. If not, then we are left with a bleak view of individual rights in today’s America.
But perhaps the more important question is, “Would you, as a citizen, support passage of the Bill of Rights today, knowing that it would grant the same rights to folks you may consider political enemies as you yourself enjoy?”
If not, why not?

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Lucas Garfinkel
Two summers ago, the skies over New Jersey turned a surreal shade of orange. Schools canceled recess, parents debated whether it was safe to let kids play outside, and doctors treated a surge of patients struggling to breathe. The culprit was wildfire smoke drifting from hundreds of miles away.
Not long after, while on my pediatrics rotation at Cooper University Hospital, I met a 10-year-old with asthma whose parents brought him in for a follow-up. His lungs had healed, but emotionally, he was stuck. He refused to play outside, convinced the air would still make him sick. His parents worried less about his lung function tests and more about the fact that their once-active son no longer felt safe riding his bike. The smoke had cleared, but the fear lingered.
From personal to professional
As a medical student planning to pursue psychiatry, I see how climate anxiety shapes the way young people think, cope, and dream. I’ve felt it myself, the sense that the fate of the planet rests on our shoulders, too daunting to fully process and too urgent to ignore. For some, this worry becomes paralyzing. For others, it fuels activism, sometimes at the cost of burnout.
Anxiety itself isn’t the problem. It’s our brain’s way of signaling that something matters. The danger comes when the immensity of the crisis convinces us there’s nothing we can do, and we face it alone. 
The rise of climate anxiety
Climate anxiety isn’t a formal diagnosis, but it is real and growing. A global survey of young people ages 16 to 25 found that 84% are at least moderately worried about climate change, and nearly half say it negatively affects their daily lives. A UNICEF report estimates that 1 billion children will be at “extremely high risk” from climate change. Children and young adults are already particularly vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress. As a result, climate anxiety may affect their risk of developing depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.
In New Jersey, where flooding, hurricanes, and air quality alerts are increasingly common, kids don’t need to imagine what climate change might do — they’ve already lived through it. Unlike past generations, today’s youth are asked to wrestle with existential questions long before they’re developmentally ready. Adolescence is supposed to be about identity and possibility. Instead, many are left wondering if those futures will even exist. Social media magnifies it: Every scroll brings another dire headline or viral video of devastation.    
The power of talking about it
The most important step we can take is simple: Talk about climate anxiety openly. Parents, teachers, and clinicians should not dismiss kids’ fears as naive. These worries are rational responses to a changing world. Naming them, validating them, and creating safe spaces to discuss them can transform dread into determination.
Neuroscience backs this up. As Adam Met writes in Amplify, when people gather in groups, our brains literally sync up: We become more open to new ideas, more capable of empathy, and crucially, more willing to act. Sociologists call this collective effervescence. It’s the spark that turns isolation into solidarity and anxiety into action.
There are also practical ways families can help young people channel their worry productively. Parents can direct their children’s energy toward advocacy groups and research organizations that they can support together. They can learn concrete steps to minimize their household’s environmental impact, encourage lifestyle changes like reducing energy use, and spend time in nature, planting trees or flowers to restore both agency and connection.
No, talking about climate change won’t suddenly stop the floods in Manville or the smoke drifting into Newark. Critics might argue that naming the problem risks frightening kids further. But avoidance feeds anxiety. Honest conversation, grounded in both reality and hope, helps young people feel less alone. 
Where we go from here
If we want the next generation to face the climate crisis with resilience rather than despair, we need to weave mental health into the fabric of our response. Schools should equip teachers to talk about climate stress. Pediatricians should screen for climate-related worries the way they already screen for bullying or depression. Parents should listen without judgment when their children voice fears about the future.
Here, New Jersey is leading the nation. It is the only state with mandatory K-12 climate education, thanks to First Lady Tammy Murphy’s initiative. Normalizing climate discussions in classrooms helps kids feel empowered rather than paralyzed by the challenges they inherit. Most importantly, we must frame climate action as a shared responsibility. No child should feel like the weight of the world rests solely on their shoulders. By fostering open conversations and collective responses, we can turn climate anxiety from a source of paralysis into a catalyst for connection and change.
Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned in medicine, and in life, it’s that healing begins when we acknowledge what hurts, and learn to weather the storm together.

(Michael Isaac Stein/Verite News)Utility companies just got their grades back from a leading environmental group’s annual report card on whether they generate clean energy and provide affordable power. In Louisiana, the results might paint a rosier picture than reality reflects.
The Sierra Club’s “Dirty Truth Report” evaluates utilities’ plans to deliver cheap, clean energy to customers and gives them a grade based on their investment in renewable energy and commitment to retire fossil fuel-generated electricity by 2035.
Cleco and Entergy are among the 75 utilities featured in the Sierra Club evaluation, which gave the entire industry an F – its lowest grade since it began issuing report cards in 2021.
Holly Bender, the Sierra Club’s chief program officer, said in a news release it was “alarming” to see utilities move backward in their transitions to clean energy transition. 
But in contrast to the national trend, New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. earned a C average. It comes after a B last year and an F in 2023. Cleco, headquartered in Pineville, received a B grade for 2025 after four straight years of Ds.
The Sierra Club’s review included grades for utility affiliates. 
Entergy New Orleans improved from a B to an A with more investment in renewable energy, who Entergy Louisiana, which fell from a B to a C, lost points for its “over-reliance on gas” and “fewer investments in renewable energy,” according to the report. 
The Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group, thinks utilities should emphasize more renewable energy generation, with a focus on community solar projects in particular.
Alaina DiLaura, the alliance’s policy coordinator, said the ratings also don’t truly capture utilities’ ongoing reliance on fossil fuels. 
For example, Cleco’s filings with the Louisiana Public Service Commission show plans to transition a coal-burning power plant to natural gas, an aspect of continued fossil fuel use she said the Sierra Club report doesn’t fully consider. 
The Sierra Club’s analysis should have been more critical of utilities’ plans to expand their reliance on natural gas, she said. 
For example, Cleco has said it will retire all but one of its coal-powered power plants and invest in carbon capture and sequestration. While proponents tout CCS projects as environmentally friendly, critics question that claim and note they encourage more fossil fuel use. The technology can also consume a lot of electricity.  
Despite originally planning to retire its coal-powered Rodemacher Unit 2 power plant in Rapides Parish, Cleco submitted plans Sept. 5 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission to keep it running using natural gas, DiLaura said. 
Cleco is also looking to use natural gas at its largest power plant, Madison 3, alongside the petroleum coke (a crude oil refining byproduct) it currently runs on. The utility has informed state regulators it will add “700 megawatts of new gas generation,” DiLaura said citing its latest filings. 
Entergy Louisiana will add 2,200 megawatts of generation capacity – a 20% increase of its statewide output – once it builds three natural gas-powered plants to run the massive Meta data center under construction in Richland Parish. 
Entergy New Orleans’ grade improvement is also misleading, DiLaura said, because its latest plans involve expanding its use of natural gas, which means the utility won’t meet its 2035 goal of net zero carbon emissions.
Entergy New Orleans spokesman Beau Tidwell said that even though it intends to use more natural gas, the company will “remain committed to transparent disclosure about our progress and any challenges we might encounter.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC_4557-2048x1367-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-24 06:57:07.782085

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.
On Tuesday, officials with Tallgrass Energy said they would soon be shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to its pipeline — a converted, former natural gas pipeline — for a 392-mile trip across Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming.
In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced it is making an initial donation of $500,000 to a fund managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation that could financially help more than 230 communities and community organizations on the route.
The company projects that more than $7 million will be distributed over 10 years through the “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” with the money targeted for local early childhood centers, elder care facilities and food pantries. That is on top of lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training sessions and equipment purchases for the mostly rural, volunteer fire and rescue departments along the pipeline route.


Summit pipeline changes
A much larger CO2 pipeline proposal, the 2,500-mile Summit, recently announced plans to provide more incentives for landowners who provide rights of way and new aid to local communities along the route, DTN/Progressive Farmer reported.
That pipeline, first proposed three years ago, would connect to 57 ethanol plants across North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska. But the Summit project has faced fierce landowner opposition in some areas, along with lawsuits and regulatory barriers.
Kleeb, of Bold Nebraska, said the offer by Summit is different than what was negotiated with Tallgrass. Summit, she said, just laid out an offer, and did not work out the new incentives with local officials.
The new offers from Summit were described by Summit CEO Joe Griffin as “a promise to operate safely, openly and in a way that brings meaningful benefits to the people and places that make this project possible,” DTN reported.

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state. The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.
“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities who have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, segment president at Tallgrass.
“We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes – from early childhood to eldercare – so that these communities can continue to grow and thrive,” he said.
A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.
Such pipelines in other states have generated opposition, as well as lawsuits and protests. In this case, though, extensive new rights of way weren’t necessary, and many landowners along the pipeline route grow corn, a crop expected to benefit from expanding the markets for corn-based ethanol by making the fuel more environmentally friendly.
Jane Kleeb, the founder of Bold Nebraska, said rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them – whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table.”

Kleeb said the agreement serves as a model for rural as well as urban communities impacted by such projects. She added that Tallgrass and Bold recently gave a presentation to officials with the NAACP.
The new pipeline, formerly the Trailblazer pipeline, is the first of its kind to begin operation as part of a push by the Biden Administration to reduce carbon emissions and make ethanol production more “green.” Making the biofuel less carbon-intensive could make it more attractive for states seeking environmental benefits, officials have said, and the pipeline will give Nebraska-produced ethanol an advantage in its use as sustainable aviation fuel, a new market for the biofuel.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.
Jeff Yost, president and CEO of Nebraska Community Foundation, said the new fund will target some of the biggest challenges facing rural communities — quality early childhood education, senior care and food insecurity — providing small grants to sustain jobs and services.
He said the foundation has already identified more than 230 organizations in the 31 impacted counties as eligible for a portion of the funds. To share in a portion of the funds, Yost said that qualified organizations will be invited to submit applications and verify that they are doing the work they profess to do.
Yost added that sometimes companies do this kind of fund sharing “for public relations purposes.”
“(But) I see these guys doing it for the right reasons,” he said.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)About a month into the Idaho “DOGE” committee opening its public comment portal, more than 450 comments were submitted with recommendations on improving government efficiency. 
Many of the submissions center around education, health care, and the committee and legislators. 
Members of the interim committee — named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency — are sifting through submissions to the DOGE portal on the Idaho Legislature’s website. The next meeting is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sept. 29 at the Idaho Capitol in Boise.

Committee co-chairman Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, told the Idaho Capital Sun he plans to focus on ideas for restructuring or consolidating agencies. However, the nearly 500 comments are going to be delegated among the committee’s eight members for deeper dives and for responses to those who didn’t submit anonymously. The names of those who submitted were redacted in the records provided to the Sun through a public records request. 
The committee is focused on reducing and reorganizing state government; it met for the first time in July, despite a bill that sought to create the committee stalling in the Legislature, the Sun reported. 
 What do the DOGE commenters think of the committee? 

The Sun reviewed the 462 comments submitted to the DOGE portal between July 25 and Aug. 25.
The comments ranged in topics from asking to eliminate mosquito abatement districts, complaining about local government entities and decisions, to suggesting all the lawmakers resign. 
More than 50 submissions suggested the committee dissolve itself. 
“Disband Idaho DOGE — this state already runs at razor-thin funding for essential services,” one submitter wrote. “It’s a performative political stunt.” 
Another submitter wrote, “Just don’t do this. Nothing is getting more efficient and naming a governing body after a meme is just insane,” referring to the popular mid-2000s meme featuring a photo of a Shiba Inu side-eying the camera. 
Ehlers said he plans to address comments like these, many of which he believes stem from a misunderstanding about how the committee works. 
“Anytime you’re making change, people are going to get worried or concerned, and I think that’s behind some of those comments,” he said. “That’s fine, people can have their opinions about us and the work that we’re doing.”  
As state legislators, Ehlers said, their salaries are fixed and the committee members are not being paid more to meet out of the usual three-month legislative session. He said the staff who are working with the committee are also not being paid extra to do their work. 
“It’s not like we’re really spending additional taxpayer dollars holding this committee,” he said. 
Other commenters expressed support for the idea of improving government efficiency, but asked the committee to do so with a more fine-toothed comb than its federal predecessor, formerly led by billionaire Elon Musk, which oversaw mass layoffs and cuts in a short period of time.

“I urge you to consider re-evaluating the Doge system with genuine community input, transparent communication, and a plan grounded in practical outcomes for citizens,” one submission said. “Otherwise, it risks becoming just another example of government inefficiency.” 
Some expressed gratitude for the effort and the ability to provide input. 
“Thank you so much for asking for regular Idahoan’s input. There are many issues before the legislature that I feel have wasted time and energy that could have been better spent,” one submission said. 
Ehlers said the amount of public participation is “a good sign.” 
“We’re getting comments from all of the political spectrum, which I think is great,” he said. “It’s great to have Idahoans involved in this and interested in what we’re doing.” 
 Medicaid, health care were some primary topics of interest  

Medicaid was mentioned in more than 20 comments. One person suggested ending the entirety of Idaho Medicaid, although some aspects of the program are federally required. 
“Idaho needs to repeal all Medicaid programs,” the submission said. “Socialized medicine will not make us healthier.  Socialized health care will soon be our biggest spending program.
Idaho Legislature’s DOGE panel looks to reorganize, reduce state government 

People who want Medicaid should move to another state.” 
There are more than 350,000 Idahoans enrolled across all Medicaid programs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation fact sheet, which is a little over 17% of the state’s population. 
Some of the comments called for the elimination of Medicaid benefits for able-bodied adults, but asked to protect the program for elderly and disabled participants. During the committee’s last meeting, committee members suggested exploring a repeal of Medicaid expansion — a program approved by Idaho voters in 2018 to provide health care coverage for adults who fell in the gap between earning too much for traditional Medicaid but not enough for tax credits to make private insurance through the state marketplace affordable, the Sun reported. Multiple bills have been proposed to repeal it since Medicaid expansion went into effect in 2020, but none advanced out of the Legislature. 
Many of the comments expressed concern that programs for elderly and disabled Idahoans would be restricted or eliminated. 
Some expressed concerns about the effects of the congressional “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which reduced federal Medicaid spending by around $1 trillion over the next decade. 
“Medicaid cut backs will potentially cause a domino effect in the Assisted Living community for many seniors and those with mental illness, who actively use the medicaid benefit to maintain housing and care in Assisted Living,” one person wrote. “With cut backs in this department, less Medicaid recipients will be retained in Assisted Living as we won’t be able to meet their needs with staffing as wage costs as well as cost of living to provide the needed items to provide adequate care to our residents. Please take this into consideration as it will drastically affect several in the community.”
Ehlers said the committee would likely meet with subject-matter experts around health care and Medicaid, and he couldn’t “promise certain ones will be cut or protected.” 
“We will give it a fair effort to examine these,” he said. 
 Several commenters highlight education and school choice tax credit 

Nearly 50 submissions called for the repeal of the school choice tax credit, a $50 million program passed during the 2025 legislative session to allow parents to use tax credits to reimburse education costs, inducing private school tuition. The credit isn’t available yet. 
“Give that $50 million set aside for vouchers to Idaho’s public schools instead so they can have the teachers, staff, supplies, and facilities to educate ALL of Idaho’s children,” one person wrote. 
A couple asked that the program be suspended or restricted. It currently is available to any family with priority going to families within 300% of the federal poverty guidelines in the first year, and priority given to families who previously received in the ongoing years. 
One commenter suggested the program be tailored to target low-income and underserved public school districts, include performance metrics for the schools that accept the funds, and that the unused dollars from the program go back to public schools. 
Ehlers said that while the committee is open to reevaluating existing laws, the members were unlikely to recommend eliminating the tax credit at this time. 
“I don’t see that being in our scope, just because it was just barely passed this session and hasn’t really been fully implemented yet,” he said. “I think we need to let that law go into effect and see the results.” 
Other comments called for more funding for public schools and libraries.

Three submissions, including one from Sen. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, called for the repeal of Idaho Launch, an $80 million grant program for graduating high school seniors to go toward employment training or higher education in “in-demand” fields.
“This one-size-fits-all scheme smothers the diversity of thought and opportunity that fuels real growth,” Lenney wrote.
 Other comments suggested more careful legislating, mass removals elected officials, agency consolidation and more

The wide-ranging comments included several calls for the removal of elected officials, such as Attorney General Raúl Labrador, Gov. Brad Little, and Idaho’s entire congressional delegation. 
A number of commenters asked the Legislature to weigh potential legal concerns more carefully, in reference to laws passed in recent years that have ended up being tied up in court. 
One person wrote, “Refrain from focusing on fringe issues and refrain from passing unconstitutional laws.” 
Another said, “If another state is getting actively sued for their legislation, don’t pass the exact same law.” 
Some suggested merging some agencies, such as Idaho Fish and Game and the State Department of Parks and Recreation. Others suggested better coordination among agencies that perform similar duties, such as the Idaho Department of Water Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality. 
A number of commenters recommended the state Legislature only meet every other year for a session and create a two-year budget, instead meeting every year. 
Six commenters asked the state to stop contracting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ISP announced the partnership in June, and said it would seek to spend up to $300,000 transporting individuals to ICE detention facilities from Idaho jails, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
A number of suggestions fell outside the purview of the Idaho Legislature, such as complaints about city governments or federal officials. 
Ehlers said the committee members intend to respond to commenters who provided contact information and explain what sorts of changes the Legislature can and cannot do. He also emphasized that the interim committee may only present proposed legislation, which would need to advance through standing committees during the legislative session, which starts in January.
“Sometimes, I think that gets forgotten, both by people wanting us to cut things right away and also people worried about just cutting too quickly,” Ehlers said. “It still has to go through the standard legislative process, whatever our recommendations are.”

The Democratic National Committee launched a five-figure digital ad campaign Wednesday focused on the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech, in a campaign targeting Virginia’s 1st and 2nd Congressional districts where incumbents Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, D-Virginia Beach, have been perceived as vulnerable by Democrats.  
The ad begins by reminding voters President Donald Trump signed an executive order when elected to his second term to “stop all government censorship.” It then references how Trump’s administration has pressured media companies to crack down on broadcasters critical of the administration. 
The ads follow the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which spurred weeks of heated debate in the commonwealth and across the country about what is and is not considered acceptable free speech. Virginia’s top schools superintendent said educators who think Kirk’s killing was acceptable should be investigated and “disqualified from teaching or working with children again.”
Va.’s chief schools superintendent advises leaders to investigate teachers for Kirk comments

Chesterfield County school board member Dorothy Heffron announced her plan to resign over her inflammatory comments following Kirk’s shooting, which she has since deleted. 
Nationally, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was briefly suspended for a joke he’d made alluding to Trump’s flippant attitude in a press event following Kirk’s death.  
The new ads are geared towards voters in the 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts who may be ready for a change in representation, organizers said, and tie incumbents Wittman and Kiggans to Trump amid the free speech debacle. Last year, Kiggans campaigned with Trump in Chesapeake while Wittman campaigned with then-Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump in Chesterfield. 
Kiggans’ district has long-oscillated between partisan control while Wittman’s reliably red district has seen shades of blue in recent years. While the DNC ad is focused on areas that could be critical in next year’s congressional midterm elections, the matter of free speech is timely, party officials said.
“Donald Trump’s administration has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on Americans simply exercising their First Amendment rights,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “This is no exaggeration, and it’s splintering the coalition that got Trump elected. That’s why today, the DNC announced a new digital ad campaign in VA-01 and VA-02 targeting conservative and independent voters.” 
A series of Democratic candidates have already lined up to challenge both candidates next year after a Democratic primary. Wittman’s challengers include former Richmond Times-Dispatch meteorologist Sean Sublette and current Henrico Commonwealths’ Attorney Shannon Taylor.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee remains among the nation’s top four states for highest number of anticipated electric vehicle manufacturing jobs despite slowing industry investments, disappearing tax incentives and federal policy uncertainty, according to a new report on electric transportation in the Southeast.
The state held onto its title as runner-up for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs in the southeast region, with 16,262 anticipated jobs compared to top-ranking Georgia’s 26,428. 
Tennessee’s place in the rankings is largely due to 5,800 jobs promised by Ford Motor Company and SK On’s BlueOval City and BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plant in rural West Tennessee. In return for the $5.6 billion project, Tennessee offered a $900 million incentive package. While battery production at the new plant is moving forward, mass production of Ford’s next-generation electric pickup truck is now delayed until 2028 due to the company’s shift in focus to smaller, more affordable electric models.

Lengthening timelines and industry pressure to create more affordable vehicles are themes highlighted in the Sept. 10 report, which is the sixth-annual study of transportation electrification in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based data analysis firm, prepared the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a renewable energy advocacy nonprofit.
The rapid injection of EV manufacturing investments coincided with tax incentives passed under former President Joe Biden’s administration, which likely sped up investments that companies already planned to make, Atlas Public Policy founder Nick Nigro said in a webcast following the report’s release.
But tax incentives of up to $7,500 for EV consumers will now sunset on Sept. 30 as part of the Trump administration’s budget reconciliation bill — named the One Big, Beautiful Bill — passed by Congress this summer, adding to market uncertainty.
The report shows continued momentum from southeastern states, where companies have announced an all-time total of $78.8 billion in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investments as of June 30. That momentum has slowed considerably, according to the report, with new investments in the southeast region over the last 12 months totaling $4.8 billion, less than a third of the previous year’s $15.2 billion.
The “huge jumps in manufacturing investments” over the last few years when companies began building more domestic-based supply chains were not sustainable, Nigro said.
“There was no doubt there was going to be a natural slowdown … because that’s the normal course of business,” he said. “The question we need to keep in mind as we look ahead is how many of these potential cancellations that are happening now and into the future are because of federal policy, or just because of the normal cycle of business?”
Nigro said it’s too soon to tell.
In the meantime, Tennessee continues to make progress in building out public electric vehicle charging infrastructure, though it still lags behind the charger-per-person rates of the nation and other southeastern states.
Tennessee, like other states, has also seen companies pause or retract investments and planned jobs. 
Piedmont Lithium announced in August 2024 that it scrapped plans for an $800 million investment for a lithium hydroxide processing facility in Southeastern Tennessee that would have created around 147 jobs. This is the sole Tennessee cancellation mentioned in the report, which includes data through June.
General Motors announced in September that it would temporarily lay off 700 workers at its Spring Hill assembly plant due to a temporary production slowdown for the Cadillac Lyriq, along with reduced production for its Vistiq EV. Tenneco, an auto parts manufacturer that supplies the GM plant, reported that it would lay off 82 workers in its own Spring Hill facility.
Volkswagen similarly announced that it would furlough around 160 employees and pause production of its electric SUV to align “production volume to market demand,” the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported earlier this month.
What will happen when tax credits sunset? Time will tell.
Nigro said about 80% of EV manufacturing facilities the report tracked in the southeast are already operating in some capacity or undergoing construction. The key question, he said, is whether demand will support full production at these facilities.
Stan Cross, electric transportation policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said it’s too early to tell how the market will react to the end of EV consumer tax credits. 
“What we do know is that when we look at adoption of electric vehicles, sticker price remains a top barrier for consumers and fleet operators, even though owning an EV is much cheaper over time,” Cross said. 
Nigro estimates that less than half of the electric vehicles sold in the last year qualified for the tax credit — which gives incentives for the purchase of vehicles with responsibly sourced components and North American assembly —  indicating consumers are willing to pay for electric vehicles without the incentive. 
Industry orgs: Budget bill’s electric vehicle tax credit rollback could hamper Tennessee momentum

Energy market analysis firm Benchmark reported in July that about half of the EVs sold in the United States were eligible for the new clean vehicle tax credit in 2025.
But the “Transportation Electrification in the Southeast” report also notes that most of the southeast’s highest-selling models were eligible for the full or partial tax credit in 2025.
“It’s going to make it tougher for some vehicles to be sold,” Nigro said, adding that companies may embrace more aggressive pricing or find other ways to squeeze costs out of production.
A manufacturing tax credit remains in place for batteries, though with tighter restrictions on foreign material sources.
“The Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Law, and even the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signaled to the market that if EVs are going to be purchased by Americans, ideally they’re built with as much domestic content as possible,” Nigro said.
Cross surmised that the sunsetting tax credits may provide a temporary boost to EV sales.
“We’re seeing a real run on EVs right now, as consumers see those tax credits dwindling, and I won’t be surprised if we see record-shattering third quarter sales here in the U.S. as a result,” he said.
Market share grows
Tennessee’s EV sales market share — the percentage of new vehicles purchased that are EVs — came in at 5.4%, a 35% annual growth from last year, according to the report. 
This puts Tennessee in the middle of the pack, ranking fourth among the six southeastern states examined by the report. Tennessee’s market share ranks 31st in the nation. 
The southeast region logged more than 912,000 cumulative EV sales during the study period, amounting to a market share of above 8%. Tennessee was responsible for 60,434 of those sales.

Charging infrastructure makes progress
Tennessee is ranked fourth in the region for number of electric vehicle chargers per person.
The state saw the lowest rate of growth in publicly accessible rapid EV chargers at 24% — a marked change from holding the highest growth rate of 60% last year.
Tennessee has 830 fast-charging ports and 1,897 slower charging ports, according to the report.
The state’s Fast Charge TN program supported EV charger installation at 35 now-operational charging sites along a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga. Another 18 sites are under development, and the application period for the program’s second round of funding recently closed. The program is funded through the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenue from the Tennessee Valley Authority and cost share from grant recipients.
The state’s program is meant to be complemented by the federally funded  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI). That program was frozen by Trump’s administration in February, but the U.S. Transportation Secretary recently released interim guidance that may allow the program to move forward after states reapply for funding. NEVI originally awarded $88 million to Tennessee to fund EV charger installation along major interstates over a 5-year period.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2860-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-24 06:57:07.782085

The event was designed to provide an opportunity for U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, along with U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, to hear and respond to local constituents’ concerns in an environment with rules for civility and respect.
Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the three representatives declined to appear. Nor did they send any prepared statements to be read to the attendees. The organizers had anticipated this and the event took place regardless, with a recording that will be sent to the members of Congress.
Over 75 people attended. Three chairs stood at the front of the auditorium, each with a large photograph of one of the absent legislators. 
Kathy Dawes, one of the organizers of the event, and Mark Havens from Interlink, a nonprofit providing services to the elderly, served as co-moderators. 
The forum was planned and conducted in accordance with guidelines from Braver Angels, a nonpartisan volunteer organization that embraces respect, honesty and responsible citizenship. They encourage this by teaching respectful communication skills through free workshops, one of which was conducted in the morning before the forum. The driving force that fuels their mission is “bringing Americans together to bridge the partisan divide and strengthen our democratic republic.”
 Issues raised by nonprofit groups

Representatives from several nonprofit groups in the region gave short presentations about their work and the challenges they face. Each ended with some specific questions for the members of Congress.
They spoke about a wide range of topics that surely would’ve been of interest to our representatives. These included the need for bipartisan solutions to climate change,  protecting the budget for scientific agencies, reforming the process for clean energy permitting, supporting funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Housing First initiative, the importance of investing in senior citizen services, concerns about cuts to federal funding for education and students with disabilities, the need to reduce the rancor in politics, and more.
 Questions from the audience

During the second hour of the forum, audience members spoke to the photos on the dais in lieu of being able to speak to their absent members of congress. They asked tough questions about topics including concerns about the Smithsonian, protecting our First Amendment rights, the negative impact of tariffs on markets for Idaho agricultural products and family farmers, the chaos caused by ICE raids when crops need to be picked, investigation into conditions at immigration detention centers, stopping President Donald Trump from sending troops into American cities, increased housing costs, the conflict in Ukraine, the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinians, and the importance of adequate funding for national parks.

The tone of the questions was as varied as the people who asked them. Many questions were carefully phrased and delivered in even tones. Other questions reflected the individuals’ frustration and even desperation, with several people literally begging the representatives to take action on issues like rent increases.
Others questions were very pointed. One questioner raised issues with multiple Trump administration actions, saying, “You’re turning a blind eye to these actions, normalizing them. What has to happen for you to stand up to this administration and stop these undemocratic actions?” Another asked, “Are you three merely cowardly Republicans afraid of Trump’s retribution, or are you supporting his lunatic and fascist takeover of our country?”
 Great turnout — except for the missing three

Despite not having the senators and congressman present, the mood in the room during the event was positive. People were attentive to the presentations and often applauded the questions.
The recording of the event is now being edited and will be sent to Sens. Crapo and Risch and Rep. Fulcher, with requests for their responses. A short video of Q&A highlights is already posted.
After the event, Dawes summed up the experience: “We were all very disappointed that our members of Congress did not attend, and that they did not even provide a statement that we requested to be able to read at the event. To not even acknowledge their constituents’ request for a statement is very difficult for me to understand. If they watch the video we send them, they will see the respectful demeanor of the crowd and the wide variety of sincere questions and comments made that really deserve a thoughtful response.”
Perhaps the only disrespectful aspect of the event was the behavior of our elected representatives.

Within 24 hours, 35 people in Charleston overdosed on what police believed to have been fentanyl laced with xylazine, a powerful tranquilizer.
In each overdose, naloxone was reportedly used to revive the person. No deaths were reported.
For Joe Solomon, a Charleston City councilman and a co-founder of Save A Life Day, it was also a reminder that more could be done for drug users in the city. 
“I wish every day were ‘Save a Life Day,” Solomon said. “The only way to do that is if we had an accessible, needs-based harm reduction program that would make every day Save A Life Day. Because you can meet hundreds of people every day where they are with what they need, and get your arms around them — naloxone, test strips, drug testing, and if they want more services like counseling and primary care and infectious disease treatment, that too.”
During this year’s Save a Life Day on Thursday, volunteers from every state — and even one from the nation of Colombia — will distribute the opioid overdose antidote drug at more than 900 sites.
Solomon and fellow co-founder Sarah Stone, both of the overdose prevention organization SOAR, helped start Save a Life Day in Kanawha and Putnam counties in 2020, as the number of fatal overdoses rose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the event was held in 32 states, including every state east of the Mississippi.

More than 30,000 doses of the opioid overdose antidote were distributed by volunteers in West Virginia during the 2024 event. 
Solomon said the milestone of being in every state is undercut by the city’s passage of legislation in 2021 that restricted harm reduction programs that may have had a bigger impact on helping people struggling with drug addiction.
“I’m torn, right? Because, it’s like you send out this real signal of hope from this place of hurt. That feels like something to be really proud about,” Solomon said. “And we’re still a place that criminalized harm reduction. And so much of our story hasn’t, I think, found the level of atonement.”
Stone said she didn’t expect the event to cause miracles, just a slow move toward lessening the stigma that has been associated with naloxone. 
“I think [going from] two counties to over 900 sites in five years is pretty good,” she said. 
Stone and Solomon are also the coordinators of Kanawha County’s Save A Life Day distribution.
West Virginia has long had the highest drug overdose rates in the country, but the state has celebrated some victories recently.
In July, West Virginia marked the largest reduction in fatal overdoses across the nation over a 12 month period. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia saw two months of declines in the annual rate of fatal overdoses, representing a 41% decrease compared to deaths reported in both preceding 12 month periods.
Stone said events like Save a Life Day have the potential to make big changes by encouraging people to talk to one another. Even in the midst of an overdose spike, Charleston is more prepared to handle the crisis today than it was five years ago, she said. People will always use drugs, she said. 
“But not talking about it, or being in denial about that or the layers and layers of shame are weird,” she said. “I like to think we’re encouraging people to have conversations about what the reality of their life and their family and their communities are so they can make it better. 
“Access to naloxone is the baseline, and we still have lots of places that don’t have access,” she said. “We’re learning a lot. We always learn a lot each year talking to people in other places about what works for them and what they do.”
The state of West Virginia is contributing 16,712 naloxone kits for Save a Life Day, which is 2,084 more kits than it did in 2024, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services told West Virginia Watch in an email. Each kit contains two doses of the drug. 
Caroline Wilson, who coordinates the national event, said the most exciting aspect of the event is the unity of volunteers from all the states coming together. 
“We’re trying to help each other. We’re trying to bring the numbers down. Yes, they’ve been dropping, but [it’s] still too many,” Wilson said. “And so it’s just amazing to see how many people are really passionate about this and want to work together and solve the overdose crisis.”

This year, the Matthew Perry Foundation and Healing Appalachia partnered to sponsor Save a Life Day, Wilson said. The “Friends” star died in October 2023 of a ketamine overdose. 
CareSource is providing funding to supply at least one newspaper-style distribution box for each state, she said. The boxes can be filled and refilled with naloxone so that people can have access to the drug as needed.
This year’s event will also add an advocacy component. Volunteers can get post cards to send to their local officials with messages encouraging them to use their opioid settlement funds to support harm reduction programs. 
While naloxone has been available over the counter since 2023, Wilson said Save a Life Day still has an important role. It allows volunteers to meet people they normally wouldn’t encounter. Many people have stories about the people who in their lives who have struggled with drug use or died of an overdose. The event also helps to decrease stigma, she said.
“It’s really cool to me, how they come up and they feel comfortable [telling their stories] just because of what we’re out there doing. They haven’t really met people like us before that they can just openly say these things too.”

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to reinstate its ban on issuing U.S. passports that reflect the chosen sex markers of transgender and nonbinary individuals.
A federal appeals court earlier this month upheld a temporary injunction against the Trump administration ban, which began with an executive order issued on the president’s first day in office. President Donald Trump’s order declared that the U.S. recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and it directed the State Department to issue passports that “reflect the holder’s sex.”
Trump order barring passport gender marker changes leaves transgender Tennesseans without IDs

In practice, the policy froze the ability of transgender individuals to obtain a passport that reflected their lived gender. 
In Tennessee, where state officials in 2023 denied trans people the right to make gender changes on driver’s licenses, Trump’s executive order jeopardized the only available form of government-issued ID available that accurately reflects the gender of transgender and nonbinary Tennesseans.
Molly Quinn, executive director for OUT Memphis, said she worries months of uncertain litigation over the ban have created confusion or discouraged people from pursuing a passport.  
Currently, transgender and nonbinary individuals have the right to apply for a new or updated passport that reflects their gender identity.
The ACLU of Tennessee and OUT Memphis, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, are holding virtual clinics intended to reach residents across the state through the passport application process, including offering guidance on applying on an expedited basis, Quinn said. 
“We’ll keep doing them until our legal partners tell us to pause,” she said.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight/Report for America)In late August 2020, Ashlee Guidry and her staff kept a wary eye on guidance from local officials as Hurricane Laura passed over Cuba en route to southwestern Louisiana. Guidry was responsible for the safety of dozens of people living at Stonebridge Place, an assisted living and memory care facility in Sulphur.
For days, Laura was just a tropical storm, wet and disorganized. But the Gulf of Mexico was warm — much warmer than average. Local officials worried the temperatures could supercharge the storm as it spun toward the Louisiana coast. So, just as Laura approached the open Gulf, two days before it would make landfall 30 miles south of Stonebridge, Guidry made the call to evacuate.
“We had to make the call as the weather started to change,” she said. “I don’t think anybody anticipated it to be as strong as it was.”
Residents were sent to a partner facility about four hours north of Stonebridge. Those with the most serious medical conditions were taken by ambulance. Others packed into vans. They avoided the highways, taking backroads for most of the drive. In the time it took to settle into the other facility, Laura rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. It eventually became one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. in the last century. It also tied for the fastest rate of intensification, with wind speeds intensifying by 65 mph in just 24 hours.
A hotter Gulf and wetter climate create more opportunity for hurricanes to intensify much faster with less notice to call for evacuations, as also seen in more recent storms like Hurricanes Ida and Helene. It’s still hard to predict how much or how fast a storm will strengthen, despite recent advances in forecasting.

Representatives of southern Louisiana communities have pressed the state to overhaul its infrastructure by turning highway shoulders into temporary travel lanes to make it easier for residents to leave as the window for evacuation shortens. But the state’s underfunded Department of Transportation and Development has balked at the multibillion-dollar price tag.
The process of evacuating can be dangerous, especially for people living in medical facilities, elderly people, or those dealing with chronic health issues. That’s why planning and timing are critical, said Guidry and other medical professionals. Gridlocks, bottlenecks, and vehicle breakdowns can result in injury, even death. In 2005, nearly 100 people died in the evacuation of Houston ahead of Hurricane Rita, which also rapidly intensified, largely due to a fatal combination of gridlock and extreme heat.
In 2022, the Louisiana Legislature created a task force with representatives from southeastern and southwestern Louisiana to study the state’s contraflow plan after lengthy evacuation times ahead of Hurricane Ida the year before. When the state enacts contraflow, all travel lanes on main evacuation routes lead out of southeastern Louisiana, allowing more people to leave in a short time frame. It was once the state’s go-to strategy for last-minute mass evacuations, though it isn’t always possible to implement. To launch the state’s current contraflow plan, several triggers must be met at least 72 hours before a storm’s landfall.
“If you go back the last three years, the storms have been pretty serious. Quickly intensifying, shifting direction, and lasting longer,” said Louisiana Rep. Matt Willard, D-New Orleans, who authored the resolution. “So we really do need to take our contraflow processes and evacuation processes seriously and start looking at what they look like over the next decade.”
As hurricanes intensify faster, the state’s existing contraflow plan has grown less and less feasible. Contraflow is also labor-intensive and can make it harder to stage resources to respond in the aftermath of a storm, so state officials have moved away from the evacuation strategy.

The task force delivered several recommendations, from shortening the time needed to initiate contraflow to repairing evacuation routes closed due to safety. The task force also introduced a strategy used in Texas and Florida: widening existing highways so the shoulders can be used as additional travel lanes to relieve congestion. The strategy is known as “evaculanes” or “emergency shoulder use.”
The state Department of Transportation and Development declined to pursue any of the recommendations. Instead, state agency spokesman Rodney Mallett said officials have focused on encouraging residents not to rely on strategies like contraflow, which is meant to be used rarely as a last resort.
Contraflow requires immense coordination among state and local agencies as well as Mississippi officials. The state has implemented contraflow twice: to evacuate 1.2 million residents ahead of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and then for a mass evacuation of 2 million residents ahead of Hurricane Gustav in 2008. It was also partially implemented for evacuations ahead of Hurricane Ivan in 2004.
Although contraflow requires less lead time in other states, Louisiana officials say a shorter time frame isn’t possible.
The current 72-hour plan includes 22 hours for transportation staff to prepare the roads and change thousands of signals to switch directions. For Katrina, the state completed preparations for contraflow within six hours, allowing officials to open all lanes for 25 hours before the weather deteriorated.

An alternative evacuation strategy
Louisiana isn’t the only state hesitant to rely on contraflow. Florida, the only state hit by more hurricanes than Louisiana and Texas, has never implemented its contraflow plan. Instead, in 2016, it developed a strategy called emergency shoulder use. Rather than reverse traffic, the state adds a temporary travel lane by using the existing shoulder on its evacuation routes.
“We were looking for something that was more efficient for us to do that took less resources,” said Rudy Powell, the Florida Department of Transportation’s chief engineer of operations. When they looked at the data, Powell said, using the shoulders gave the state a similar level of relief as contraflow, with a fraction of the resources, such as fewer law enforcement staff.

Contraflow is also less safe to operate at night, while emergency shoulders can run continuously without blocking out-of-state resources from entering areas ahead of the storm, such as groceries and other supplies. Depending on which highways need more capacity, Powell said, the emergency use of shoulders takes two to four hours to implement.
“This is our go-to strategy for hurricane evacuation traffic,” Powell said. “The times we implemented it, it’s made a big difference in volume and speed. The whole idea is to keep traffic flowing.”
Traffic may still creep along slowly, but it will be moving, he said.
Willard said the Louisiana Contraflow Task Force proposed the use of shoulders to the state as another way to help people evacuate faster.
“You can stymie the congestion and prevent people from sitting in hours of traffic, especially people who wait until the last minute,” Willard said.
But the Louisiana transportation department said the strategy would be too expensive to even consider implementing in the state.
Unlike Florida, Louisiana hasn’t historically constructed shoulders wide enough to be safely used as temporary travel lanes. The standard for highway and bridge construction in Florida has long required the state to build shoulders at least 10 feet wide. Shoulders must be at least 8 feet wide to accommodate traffic. They also have to be structurally secure. Louisiana roads and bridges are narrower, such as the shoulders on the Interstate 10 bridge over the Bonnet Carré Spillway.
The Interstate 10 Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge, as seen on Sept. 15, 2025, from a SouthWings flight. Widening such bridges to better accommodate traffic during hurricane evacuations would cost up to $28 million per mile, according to Louisiana’s transportation department. (Photo by Christiana Botic//Verite News and CatchLight/Report for America)
In 2024, the transportation department estimated that reconstructing the shoulders along I-10, I-59, and I-55 and their bridges would cost at least $1 billion, not including other structures that would need to be rebuilt to accommodate the new shoulder width. The majority of that money would go toward widening the bridges, which would cost up to $28 million per mile.
Shawn Wilson led the Department of Transportation under Gov. John Bel Edwards from 2016 until Wilson resigned in early 2023 for an unsuccessful run for governor. He said the agency had begun taking steps toward rehabilitating the state’s inconsistent shoulder construction before he left, even incorporating wider shoulders on new bridges along I-12. While the changes would be costly, Wilson said he believes they could be done incrementally, within other road projects, so the state could eventually use the shoulders as evacuation lanes.
“Looking to do all of that at one time is just not financially feasible or recommended,” Wilson said. “It does take time, and the best way to approach it is to have consistent, steady investment in infrastructure.”
But any road improvements, Wilson said, are weighed against the cheaper cost to simply maintain state highways as they are. Louisiana ranks among the lowest in transportation spending, and the state’s spending on highways has fallen since 2007. A decades-old fuel tax is the only consistent source of revenue, but it hasn’t been enough to even maintain the state’s aging infrastructure. And Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana President Steven Procopio said the lack of funding has led to a $19 billion backlog in road projects. In 2023, the state and federal fuel tax combined raised $600 million in annual revenue for the agency. Special capital projects typically rely on state surplus dollars, Procopio said.
He noted the state’s 20-cent-per-gallon fuel tax has been the same since 1990 and much of the revenue goes toward paying off old debt, not new projects.
“Inflation is just eating up the spending power of these dollars,” he said.
As construction costs continue to rise, Willard said, now is the time to start looking at ways to start widening highways. He knows it would be costly, but he feels the state could prioritize westbound traffic by starting with the bridge over the Bonnet Carré Spillway as part of a larger construction plan.

“The longer we wait to do stuff like this, the more expensive it becomes,” he said.
Willard said the state legislature could also dedicate surplus funds to work toward additional evacuation lanes, but lawmakers haven’t taken up the issue.

When to leave
Debra Campbell said it took her 14 hours to make the 200-mile drive to Lake Charles when she evacuated New Orleans the day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. It was the same day then-Mayor Ray Nagin finally called for a mandatory evacuation of the city. (Nagin later admitted he could have issued the order earlier.)
“It was hectic,” Campbell said. “It took so many hours for our people to get to safety. But we got out.”
Campbell made it through the slow-moving traffic unscathed, but, for others, she said the evacuation itself was plagued with stressors like running out of gas or threats of violence from other frustrated motorists.
While more than 1 million people made it out of southeastern Louisiana, tens of thousands remained behind. Many weren’t able to leave. Some didn’t have a car, while many others couldn’t afford the gas needed to evacuate or a multiday hotel stay while waiting to return.
Campbell chaired the state’s Contraflow Task Force and leads A Community Voice-Louisiana, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of low- to moderate-income families in the state. For years, Campbell has advocated for state and local officials to find more ways to get people out of New Orleans and the surrounding parishes, especially people who can’t afford the cost of evacuation.
“The people don’t have the resources to evacuate as it is, so they’re not going to make a move until the very last minute,” she said.
One University of Florida study found that insecure access to transportation can play a key role when making evacuation decisions, including whether residents can receive medical services. Low-income, car-less and senior residents face an increased health risk throughout a hurricane as a result.
In lieu of infrastructure changes, state transportation officials want residents to leave as early as possible.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight/Report for America)
“We suggest people listen to their local officials, don’t wait until the last minute to evacuate, get a game plan and go north,” Mallett said. He added that the bottleneck ahead of Hurricane Ida was largely constrained to I-10, while evacuation routes north faced less congestion. While evacuees from Baton Rouge took 15 hours to reach Houston, the trip to Dallas took eight hours.
“That’s bad math right there,” Mallett said in a video asking residents to prepare for hurricane season; the agency also suggests finding friends in northern Louisiana.
Leaving early and avoiding popular routes out of New Orleans can reduce the time it takes to evacuate. People who are especially vulnerable to health issues while on the road should prepare their medications, monitor their blood pressure, stay hydrated and ensure they’re able to stay cool while traveling.
The stress of traveling can exacerbate health conditions, on top of the anxiety that weighs many Louisianians down during hurricane season, said DePaul Community Health Centers pharmacy director Raymond Strong.
“For all diseases, whether it’s asthma, hypertension, cancer, or HIV, stress makes it worse,” he said. Planning ahead, he said, can help manage the amount of stress patients feel.
Campbell and others advocating for the state to start planning for more rapidly intensifying storms agree that leaving early is important for safety. But Campbell isn’t convinced it’s realistic, especially for working-class residents.
“People’s finances don’t always allow them to leave early. They have to be pushed to move,” she said, adding that without a mandatory evacuation order, businesses stay open and some people try to stay and work as long as possible. “That’s why we need [the state] to open up all the lanes.”
Although the state isn’t looking to make big changes to its evacuation plans, Campbell said, there has been progress with New Orleans officials. Public buses provided to evacuate residents from the city to shelters could soon be more easily accessible. The city is also considering another task force recommendation: installing a siren system to help alert residents during tornadoes and other hazards.
Campbell said she hopes city and state officials continue to think of more ways to help people leave before major hurricanes hit.
“We have to offer them as much as we can,” she said. “The task force needed to meet with the people who could make a difference, but now we need to see it implemented.”

Kentucky Lantern reporter Liam Niemeyer was honored this week for his reporting on dam safety in Kentucky.
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials at its national conference in Cleveland on Monday awarded Niemeyer its Media Outreach award for his “deep dive” look at the “funding and enforcement challenges that are resulting in dozens of high-hazard potential dams in poor or unsatisfactory conditions.” The organization called it “a case study on dam safety reporting at the state level.” 
Dozens of dams in Kentucky are in poor shape or worse. They won’t be cheap to fix.

Niemeyer’s reporting highlighted the deteriorating condition of dozens of hazardous dams across Kentucky, a growing infrastructure challenge that could potentially cost billions of dollars to fix. His reporting also detailed the challenges with finding and holding accountable dam owners responsible for the worsening infrastructure.
Kentucky Lantern editor Jamie Lucke said, “Liam used the Kentucky Open Records Act to locate dams — 71 of them across Kentucky — that are in poor condition and also in places where leaks or failures would harm people or property. Liam also interviewed government officials, including two mayors on opposite ends of the state, to better convey the challenges of putting together funding and plans to make needed repairs. It’s gratifying that our public service journalism is being recognized by experts in dam safety.”
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials, headquartered in Lexington, represents a range of professionals focused on dam safety including state and federal regulators, engineers, dam owners and operators and more. The organization established the Media Outreach award for journalists in 2017 to recognize reporting that enhances “the public understanding of the impact dams have on society” among other notable contributions on dam safety. 
The organization this week also recognized with a Media Outreach award the work of two Bloomberg reporters who highlighted the impacts of climate change on dam infrastructure across the country. According to the association, previous recipients of the Media Outreach award include The State newspaper in South Carolina and the Associated Press.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-1024x791.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

(Getty Images)The ugly specter of mid-term gerrymandering may be rearing its head in Kentucky, and the potential disruption to our state’s federal representation is impossible to overstate. 
It started in Texas when President Donald Trump urged lawmakers there to redraw their congressional district boundaries in order to create more Republican seats and help protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Predictably, Texas Republicans, supported by Trump acolyte Gov. Greg Abbott, complied. In response, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has initiated a process designed to do the same thing in his state, which could balance any Republican gains in Texas. 
Historically, redistricting is done every 10 years following the decennial census. This makes sense because House seats are allocated based on population, which can change significantly over 10 years. 
It is highly unusual for states to redraw district lines between censuses unless they are ordered to do so by the courts. In fact, since 1970, only Texas (twice) and Georgia have redistricted for partisan advantage. But now a redistricting battle is underway, and every state with one-party control and seats held by the minority party is under pressure to enter the fray. Kentucky is in that category. 
My former seat, Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District, the one now occupied by Morgan McGarvey, is one of the most “logical” districts anywhere. It currently includes all but roughly 20,000 people who live in Louisville Metro, and none outside the city lines. There is no confusion as to what member of Congress represents the interests of the Louisville community, including, for example, the University of Louisville. The mayor and the U.S. representative for the 3rd District have essentially the same constituencies, making coordination of multi-governmental efforts very effective and efficient. 
Now there is discussion among some Republicans in Frankfort about splitting the Louisville community into three different congressional districts, presumably making it almost impossible, in the current environment, for a Democrat to be elected. This strategy was discussed briefly after the 2020 census, but the five Republican members of the Kentucky House delegation, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, convinced Republicans in the General Assembly that it was a bad idea.
Under the concept under discussion back then, for example, a portion of Louisville would have become part of a district that extended south to the Tennessee border. Understandably, the Republican members of the federal delegation were happy with their “safe” districts and didn’t want a bunch of Louisville Democratic voters in their jurisdictions.
I don’t believe McConnell ever made any public comments about the idea, but I’m sure he understood the political risk of doing something so damaging to his hometown, and also the University of Louisville, to which he has always been fiercely loyal. 
Now the idea apparently has resurfaced, as some Republican members of the Kentucky legislature somehow think they haven’t done enough to disenfranchise many Kentuckians, especially Louisvillians. 
Wiser heads must prevail. Tennessee offers a vivid lesson as to the damage such a move would do. Legislators there split Nashville into three districts during their decennial process. Now the state’s capital has three people representing it in the U.S. House, and this is one case in which more is not better. 
The math is simple. Each congressional district across the country includes roughly 750,000 people. If you divide a district by three, that means in Nashville, 250,000 people are placed in a new district with 500,000 other Tennesseans, most of whom have little in common with them. If you are their representative, whose interests will have your priority? Clearly it is the 500,000, who will most likely have given you your victory margin. 
Right now, Nashville has a Democratic mayor. He must work with three Republican representatives on any federal initiative. I recently spoke with a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who outlined the problems with such a setup. Vanderbilt, for example, has had to reorient its government relations efforts to deal with multiple Washington offices rather than one. I won’t go into all the problems caused in Nashville by this strategy, but suffice to say, Nashville has not benefitted from the redistricting, and neither has anyone else in Tennessee, except Republican candidates.
Missouri is about to do the same thing to Kansas City, breaking up its largest city and economic engine for strictly partisan electoral advantage, and in that case, essentially disenfranchising a large Black population from federal representation. 
Hopefully, this idea will be nipped in the bud. No one should want the University of Louisville to have three representatives, none of whom would consider that institution a priority if they also represented Western Kentucky University or Morehead. It’s true that Louisville’s critical airport has only one representative, but how much interest would someone have in that critical facility if they also represented Bowling Green or Owensboro? Similar examples are numerous. 
Louisville has never had a Black representative in Congress, but Black voters have a decisive impact on who represents them in Congress. That would not be the case if the district is sliced apart. It is a certainty that such a plan would be challenged in court on racial discrimination grounds.
Most Americans don’t like gerrymandering, which serves nothing but partisan electoral ambitions. They believe, as I do, that voters should choose their politicians; politicians should not choose their voters. I am less and less optimistic that today’s Kentucky Republican officials will consider the public interest, but hope springs eternal.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1094078594-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.”

I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment.
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word.
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling.
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue.
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”
The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Three Stafford County voters are asking a judge to remove Democratic House of Delegates nominee Stacey Carroll from the ballot, arguing she doesn’t actually live in the district where she registered to vote and is running for office. 
The petition, filed in Stafford County Circuit Court, contends Carroll lives at a longtime home in House District 23 while claiming a different address in neighboring House District 64 to qualify for the race.
In the complaint brought under a Virginia statute that allows voters to object to another person’s registration, petitioners Stephen Edward Schwartz, Judith Anne Parker and Juliet McGee Schweiter allege Carroll changed her voter registration on Feb. 5, 2025, to an address on Pinkerton Court in District 64 but “continues to reside” on Bismark Drive in District 23. The latter, which includes parts of Stafford and Prince William counties, is currently represented by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William. 
The filing lists the Bismark Drive house as a property Carroll has owned and occupied since 2018. It asks the court to hear the case on an expedited basis, cancel Carroll’s District 64 registration and direct state officials to decertify her candidacy and remove her from the ballot.
The petition says the Pinkerton Court property “is owned by Jared Harmon and Crystal Harmon,” and that the Harmons still live there. 
The voters say their challenge rests on months of observation and documentary indicators they argue show Carroll never moved. 
“Carroll is physically present at 71 Bismark Drive on a consistent basis,” the petition alleges, adding that her “primary vehicle, a white 2017 Cadillac Escalade, is consistently parked” at the Bismark Drive address “for significant periods of the day and overnight.”

The filing also asserts she “continues to receive mail” at Bismark Drive, “pays the electricity bill” there, and that her certified public accountant license lists Bismark as her residence. Conversely, “Motor vehicles belonging to Carroll and her immediate family have not been observed” at the Pinkerton Court address, and the Harmons’ vehicles are regularly there, the petition says.
Under Virginia law, voters must be residents of the precinct where they vote, a concept that “requires both domicile and place of abode,” according to Article II, Section 1 of the state Constitution quoted in the suit. 
State statute similarly defines domicile as a person’s primary home requiring presence and an intent to remain, and the petition cites case law that “there must be both act and intention in order to acquire new legal residence.” The burden to show the change is on the registrant, the filing says, quoting the Supreme Court of Virginia’s Kegley v. Johnson decision in 1966.
Because the constitution also requires would-be delegates to be residents of the district they seek to represent, the petitioners argue, Carroll “is not qualified to be a delegate from House of Delegates District 64” if she is not lawfully registered there. 
The filing says notice of the petition was provided to Carroll and the state Democratic Party on Aug. 29.
Carroll, a military veteran who is challenging Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, pushed back forcefully on the lawsuit, calling it an attack not just on her but on military families more broadly. 
“The accusations about where I live are false and insulting to every veteran and military family who knows what it means to move in service to our country,” she said in an email. She added that she is “a proud resident of House District 64” and remains “committed to serving this community.” 
Carroll argued that questioning her residency was an affront to those who relocate for service, saying, “To suggest that military families don’t belong in the communities they serve dishonors that sacrifice.”
The lawsuit names as respondents Stafford County General Registrar Anna Hash, the Virginia State Board of Elections, the Department of Elections, and Carroll. The venue is proper, the petition says, because all three petitioners are Stafford County voters and Carroll “is on the registration records in Stafford County.”
Residency disputes surface periodically in Virginia, particularly after redistricting. 
In 2023, several Chesterfield County residents challenged Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi’s eligibility, arguing she hadn’t met residency requirements in the newly drawn 15th Senate District. A Chesterfield judge dismissed the challenge after a hearing, and reporting at the time detailed the petitioners’ surveillance-style claims about vehicle movements and time spent at a prior family home — paralleling some of the allegations seen in the Carroll petition. 
Earlier, in 2011, voters used the same Virginia Code § 24.2-431 process to challenge the registration of House candidate David Ramadan in Loudoun County’s newly created 87th District. The court opinion and contemporaneous reporting show petitioners argued Ramadan lacked proper domicile in the district.
The legal standards the Stafford petition leans on are longstanding. In Kegley v. Johnson, the Virginia Supreme Court emphasized that a voter changing residence must pair a physical move with intent to remain, and the registrant bears the burden to prove both.
The petition here quotes that principle and also cites the State Board of Elections’ regulatory definition of “domicile” as “a person’s primary home, the place where a person dwells and which [s]he considers to be the center of h[er] domestic, social, and civil life.”
In the Stafford case, the petitioners list a dozen factual assertions they say support their claim that Bismark Drive remains Carroll’s true home — ranging from overnight parking patterns and household trash production to utility payments and mail delivery — and assert “no activity has been observed” at Bismark Drive “that is consistent with a change in residency, such as a moving truck, packing, or other similar activities.” 
At the Pinkerton address, they allege, “no activity has been observed … that is consistent with a change in residency.”
The filing also argues the petitioners have a “constitutional and statutory right to be represented in the House of Delegates by a resident” of their district and that Carroll’s alleged misregistration infringes that right. 
While each case turns on its facts, Virginia’s press and courts have noted these fights often hinge on documentary breadcrumbs and ordinary-life details that show where a candidate actually lives. 
The Mercury has previously examined how residency and redistricting rules can scramble political maps and candidacies after lines are redrawn, noting that the state’s requirement that legislators reside in the districts they represent has added “intrigue” to election cycles.
The Stafford petition does not specify a hearing date but asks for expedited consideration under the election code. If the court agrees with the petitioners, it could cancel Carroll’s registration at the Pinkerton address and order her decertified as a candidate in District 64. 
If the court finds Carroll established domicile in District 64 and abandoned the Bismark Drive domicile, the case would be dismissed — similar to how the Hashmi challenge ended in 2023.
Residency objections during election cycles are typically handled promptly given looming timelines.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Lake-minded New Hampshire legislators are gearing up to tackle water quality once again this session, after some measures aimed at preventing and treating cyanobacteria blooms were voted down or softened last session.
“We’ve got a really enormous problem headed at us, especially with climate change and warming waters,” said sponsor Sen. David Watters. “… I’m worried it will create this toxic stew in our lakes and along the shore.”
Watters said he had two main objectives in mind for the bill: Formalizing a strategy to address cyanobacteria blooms and other emerging water quality threats, then settling on a way to fund those efforts.
Blooms are population explosions of single-celled, toxin-producing organisms called cyanobacteria. Sometimes, they appear as surface scum or swirling green clouds, but they may also sink to the bottom of a lake or appear less dense, making them invisible to the casual observer. 
Cyanobacteria thrive in nutrient-flooded water, often the result of septic and fertilizer runoff, and in warm temperatures. Warming associated with climate change is causing them to appear more often, and though they typically occur in summer, in some New Hampshire lakes, cyanobacteria blooms are occurring year-round.
Though officials have previously downplayed the risks associated with cyanobacteria, the organisms can indeed be dangerous. The toxins cyanobacteria release can cause health concerns for people and pets who come into contact with blooms, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Reactions to cyanobacteria range from rashes and headaches to nausea, cough, and neurological symptoms, depending on exposure level and the type of bacterial toxin emitted by the bloom.  
“There is a health issue here, a potential health issue that I think we need to really address,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Rosemarie Rung, citing research linking cyanobacteria toxin exposure to the neurodegenerative disease ALS.
For these reasons, and to safeguard the economic role New Hampshire’s lakes play in the state’s tourism economy, Rung and Watters said finding a policy path toward addressing cyanobacteria was a priority.
Previous legislative efforts regarding cyanobacteria have sought to limit them at the source by reducing the influx of nutrient-rich chemical fertilizers into New Hampshire’s water supply. Legislators showed bipartisan support for a bill restricting some fertilizers and creating guidelines prohibiting fertilizer application near storm drains when they overturned then-Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the measure in October 2024. (However, the House later softened penalties for prohibited fertilizer application during the 2025 session.)
Once a cyanobacteria bloom emerges in a body of water, the cost required to treat it begins to climb. 
“Addressing cyanobacteria is incredibly expensive,” Rung said.
Aluminum is often used to rid lakes of the blooms, a feat it accomplishes by binding to the bacteria-nourishing element phosphorus and sinking, removing the nutrient from the water column. But on top of the fact that the treatments can endanger lakes’ broader ecosystems and aren’t considered permanent solutions by biologists, they can also carry price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The Legislature established a cyanobacteria fund several years ago to combat the blooms, Rung said, and through it disbursed about $3 million in state and American Rescue Plan Act funding for treatment of lakes around the state. But all that action depleted the fund, Rung said.
“That money’s gone,” she said. 
Watters said the high cost of treating cyanobacteria was worth it in the context of New Hampshire lakes’ function as economic engines and their cultural importance. Watters is worried the blooms will worsen, sickening people and pets and affecting fisheries and property values, he said.
Another possible funding route that Rung introduced last session, which would feed the cyanobacteria fund through sales of a “Love NH Lakes” license plate, was retained in the transportation committee.  
According to a draft version of Watters’ planned bill, the proposal would amend statute to permit the formation of village districts around the goal of addressing water quality concerns, including cyanobacteria blooms. 
Village districts allow regions across multiple municipalities or a smaller portion of a single municipality to operate as an organized body. In the context of cyanobacteria, Rung and Watters hope this would help districts coordinate efforts to control the blooms. With voter approval, the districts could also raise funds for remediation, they said.
This idea has already been raised in the Legislature in prior years by lawmakers of both parties without success. A bill sponsored by former Rep. Dan Wolf in 2024 was the first attempt at such an amendment, narrowly failing in the House, Rung recalled. Last session, Rung introduced a similar bill again — but it was controversial among conservative legislators who considered it another avenue toward “adding a new tax,” she said.
Rung disagrees with this assessment, saying the modification would principally allow lakefront property owners to organize themselves across municipality lines. A vote would be required to raise taxes within the districts, she said. 
Watters said he expected some lawmakers to categorically resist the possibility of raising taxes for any reason, including to fight cyanobacteria. But, he said, lakefront property owners may feel differently, especially if their property values and lifestyles could be affected by cyanobacteria blooms.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)News of Pennsylvania’s budget impasse reads like sports coverage with mention of wins, losses, pitches and next moves. 
But for sexual assault survivors and the organizations that support them, the state budget isn’t a game. 
It’s a lifeline.
We each serve as the president of an agency’s board of directors, either for our local rape crisis center or their statewide coalition. A large portion of the services we provide are funded by the state; because of the impasse, our agencies are working without payment. 
But we can’t hold out much longer.
Rape crisis centers in Pa. say flat funding threatens survivor support

Across the Commonwealth, rape crisis centers annually support 27,000 people impacted by sexual violence – one-third of whom are children – with services including 24/7 crisis hotlines and forensic rape exam accompaniment, victim advocacy, and counseling. We meet victims in the darkest moments of their lives, and work with them towards healing. 
Our crucial services continue through the budget impasse because sexual assault does not pause for politics. 
Yet this puts our agencies in an unsustainable situation. How are we supposed to do our jobs without payment? 
Each day, the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.
What does that mean for our communities when rape crisis centers aren’t there to respond?  Phone calls at 3:00 a.m. from a survivor with PTSD are sent to voicemail. Victims in the ER are handed a business card instead of having an advocate at their side during a rape exam. Child survivors are put on long wait lists for therapy. 










Each day the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.


In short: victims don’t get the support they need, trauma goes untreated, and people suffer. 
We hope that this is a reminder to everyone in the commonwealth that the state budget isn’t about politics. It’s about people’s lives. 
Pennsylvania’s rape crisis centers have never stopped doing their job. Now we need our state leaders to stop playing games and do theirs.
Four of the authors are the current board presidents for their county’s rape crisis center; the fifth author holds that role for the statewide coalition for all 48 rape crisis centers.

At least nearly a dozen LifeWise Academy Ohio programs have taken public school students on field trips to the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in Kentucky, which claims humans lived alongside dinosaurs and the Earth is only 6,000 years old.
LifeWise Academy is a controversial Hilliard-based religious instruction program for public school students on “religious release time,” that operates in 34 states and plans to enroll nearly 100,000 students this school year, according to its website.
It will also be in almost half of Ohio’s public school districts this school year.
LifeWise Academy programs in Adams County, Holgate Schools (Henry County), Continental Schools (Putnam County), Antwerp Schools (Paulding County), Wayne Trace Schools (Paulding County), Paulding Schools (Paulding County), Central Local (Defiance County), Van Wert (Van Wert County), and Tinora (part of Northeastern Schools in Defiance County) have all taken field trips to the Ark Encounter this year, in 2024 or 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs.

Pandora-Gilboa’s LifeWise Academy Program (Putnam County) has visited the Creation Museum every year from 2021-2025 and Upper Arlington’s LifeWise Program (Franklin County) visited the museum in 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs. 
The Creation Museum promotes young Earth creationism, the belief that God created the universe and everything in it in six 24-hour days 6,000 years ago. 
This comes from a literal interpretation of Genesis 1 where God created the universe. 
The museum in Petersburg, Kentucky depicts humans and dinosaurs living together and characterizes the Earth as approximately 6,000 years old. 
“LifeWise teaches Bible lessons, plain and simple,” Christine Czernejewski, a spokesperson for LifeWise, said in an email. “As such, kids are taught what Genesis 1 actually says — that God created all things and that He created them over the course of 6 different days.”
Scientists have determined Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. 
“The science (at the Creation Museum), it’s just appalling,” said Daniel Phelps, a retired geologist based in Kentucky. 
“They depict dinosaurs and humans as living together. They have many, multiple attacks on the standard view of science, especially things like theology and biology and paleontology. … They misinterpret a lot of the human fossil record, and the Art Park especially has a display that disputes climate science.”
LifeWise Academy is a non-denominational Christian program that teaches the Bible to public school students during the school day at a special release time.
“We tend to teach the Bible kind of as it teaches,” said LifeWise Founder and CEO Joel Penton. “We do talk through the six days of creation as outlined in Genesis 1. However, developing a systematic theology of young Earth versus old Earth, we leave that to local churches.”

In January, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a law passed by Republican lawmakers that mandates public school districts create a policy allowing students release time for religious instruction.
It concerns Phelps that LifeWise programs are taking students to the museum and the ark. 
“I would like to call this educational malpractice,” Phelps said. “It simply is not science, and the students are being misled. They’re basically learning to distrust science and follow an extremely fringe version of Christianity.”
A 2019 Gallup poll showed that 40% of U.S. adults believe in creationism, the belief that God created humans in their present form within roughly the past 10,000 years.   
“Most Christians don’t accept the fundamentalist version of creationism,” Phelps said. “… It’s also going to hurt kids that want to have a future studying science and are going to learn all these things that just simply are not true.”
The Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter are both operated by Answers in Genesis, a fundamentalist Christian apologetics organization that promotes young Earth creationism. 
The Creation Museum opened in 2007 and the Ark Encounter, 510-foot wooden ship intended as a replica of the biblical Noah’s Ark, opened in 2016. 
LifeWise said all field trips require parental permission. 
“LifeWise programs have taken field trips to museums, local parks, sporting events and area churches,” Czernejewski said.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change) Earlier this year, some conservative states began to embrace child tax credits that put cash directly into the hands of families raising children.
Long favored by liberals, child tax credits can help ease the financial burdens of parenthood and have been shown to slash childhood poverty rates.
But despite initial optimism from sponsors and child welfare advocates, Republican proposals in Indiana and Ohio did not advance this year. Had either measure passed, it would have been the first refundable child tax credit approved in a conservative state.
“The result has been more talk than action,” said Aidan Davis, state policy director at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has tracked the issue.
Despite the Indiana and Ohio rejections, Georgia did approve a new $250 annual tax credit this year, and Utah expanded eligibility for the state’s existing child tax credit program. But both of those are nonrefundable credits, meaning they do not aid the lowest-income families, who earn too little to owe income taxes.
Refundable tax credits provide money directly to families: While parents must still file tax returns, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

“When child tax credits are refundable, they boost the incomes of families with children and can provide a little financial breathing room — which goes a long way in creating a healthy environment for kids to grow up,” Davis told Stateline.
Still, Davis said movement in states such as Utah and Georgia does mark important progress, especially if lawmakers are willing to reassess the details of the programs, namely whether to make the credit refundable.
“It’s a step forward in those states, but there are much more effective ways to design those policies to best support children and families,” she said.
Georgia’s child tax credit was a priority of Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, now a Republican candidate for governor, as part of a wider effort on child care affordability. Jones framed the child tax credit and an expanded child care tax credit as means of boosting the workforce and reducing costs for families.
In Utah, lawmakers expanded the state’s child tax credit as part of a wider tax cut package. Republican state Rep. Mark Strong argued expanding the program would help families and societies.
“We’d also love to encourage young families to have children,” he said, according to the Deseret News.
Setbacks
Early this year, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a refundable tax credit worth up to $1,000 per child up to age 6, to be paid for by an increase in tobacco taxes. When introducing the idea, DeWine said the concept was bipartisan, “not a liberal or a conservative proposal.”
But the state House stripped the proposal from the budget. In June, advocates pushed a conference committee to reinstate the measure, but there was little appetite in the GOP-dominated chambers.
“Other than the governor, at least among the legislature, I haven’t heard anybody who was interested in bringing the idea back,” Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman said, according to The Statehouse News Bureau.
‘Why not us?’ Nannies, housekeepers win labor protections in some states.

House leaders previously said they were skeptical of any proposed tax increases this session — including the governor’s plan to pay for the child tax credit through higher cigarette taxes.
In June, Huffman said he was more focused on delivering low taxes to Ohioans across the board and questioned the impact a $1,000 tax credit would have on families.
“I don’t think it’s a tremendous tax break to many Ohioans,” he said.
Lawmakers sent their final budget to the governor without the tax credit — but did include tax cuts for wealthy Ohioans and hundreds of millions of dollars for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. DeWine signed the budget bill July 1.
In Indiana, a plan to give a $500 refundable tax credit to families with an infant sailed through the state Senate.
The measure’s Republican sponsor, state Sen. Greg Walker, told Stateline in March he hoped the bill might prove a first step in creating a broader child tax credit program.
“I think it’s — pardon the pun — a baby step to introduce a credit for a newborn,” he said. “I don’t think anyone disputes … all the costs associated with bringing a new baby into the world.”
The bill received unanimous approval from a Senate committee and passed through the upper chamber without any opposing votes. But the measure did not advance beyond a state House committee.
In a recent statement to Stateline, Walker said he would not reintroduce the proposal next year because 2026 is not a budget cycle year for the legislature.
“There is little traction for changing tax law to reduce state receipts without a corresponding reduction in allocations,” his statement said.
Growing interest
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions.


12 states and the District of Columbia have refundable child tax credits.


That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, according to research from Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Before the pandemic, only New York and California had refundable child tax credits. Since then, 10 more liberal-leaning states and the District of Columbia have implemented such policies, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
Researchers there found state programs can reduce childhood poverty and boost household incomes if the tax credits are fully refundable, provide at least $1,000 per child and are available to families with children across all ages and wide income ranges.
As child poverty doubles, states launch or expand their own tax credits

In Colorado and Minnesota — states with robust programs — child tax credits can help fill some of the void left by the end of the temporary federal expansion, said Ryan Vinh, a research analyst at the center.
Still, states don’t possess the same level of resources that the federal government has at its disposal to move the needle on childhood poverty, Vinh noted. And those resources will be further stretched with looming federal funding cuts to food assistance, Medicaid and other programs that were a part of July’s major tax and spending law.
Some state child tax credit programs are not permanent and are dependent on available funding, he said. For example, Washington, D.C., nixed funding of its $420 child tax credit this year because of budgetary concerns. And Georgia lawmakers are discussing complete elimination of the state income tax, further eroding the benefit of the new tax credit, he said.
“As states are increasingly facing these different budget shortfalls as a result of this new federal bill, they’re going to be forced to make tough decisions,” Vinh said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New billing policy by insurers sows confusion among CT physicians,Katy Golvala and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/cigna-aetna-insurance-billing-policy/,"Physicians say the change could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, though confusion about it persists.","Physicians in Connecticut and around the country are sounding the alarm about a new policy by insurers they say could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, but confusion persists about how the policy will  be enacted.
On July 1, Cigna announced an update to its reimbursement policy. Beginning Oct. 1, the announcement said, the insurer would review claims for office visits billed at the highest reimbursement rates — “Level 4” and “Level 5.” Cigna would then reduce the rate in cases where the claims suggested the visits didn’t actually meet the appropriate level of complexity, without consulting the physician in advance.
If providers disagreed with the reduction in reimbursement, they could submit medical records substantiating the higher billing code and Cigna would adjust the reimbursement back up.
“This change is designed to reduce overbilling, promote accurate documentation, and align with the American Medical Association coding guidelines,” Justine Sessions, a spokesperson with Cigna, said in emailed comments. “Importantly, this policy change does not lead to more denials or delay care for customers in any way.”
A similar policy by Aetna went into effect in Connecticut in March 2025, Phillip Blando, a spokesperson with the company confirmed. Blando said Aetna’s billing criteria “are based on CMS and American Medical Association guidelines.”
“Evaluating the appropriateness of levels 4 and 5 codes helps us ensure providers are billing for their services consistent with national guidelines,” Blando said in emailed comments.
Reaction from physicians to the July announcement was swift. 

Dr. Peter Hahn, a cardiac electrophysiologist, works on his computer at Advanced Vein Associates in Uncasville on Sept. 15, 2025. Hahn is concerned that a new reimbursement policy announced by Aetna and Cigna will result in lost revenue and increased administrative burden for his private practice.

“My understanding, and the understanding of everyone who’s been rallying the cry about this is, the new policy just says they’re going to downcode everybody and it’s up to us to go back and fight and prove we’re not doing it inappropriately,” said Peter Hahn, a cardiologist in Uncasville. “Only then, after we file the appeal, can we get paid for the services rendered.” 
The concern from providers even caught the attention of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who wrote a letter to Cigna calling for the policy’s reversal.
“If allowed, this new policy will significantly increase administrative burdens and costs for physicians while jeopardizing patient care. I urge you to reverse this decision and instead work closely with physicians to address any billing concerns,” Blumenthal wrote in the Sept. 11 letter.
But two days before Blumenthal sent his letter, Cigna had issued a clarification on Sept. 9 stating that the change was actually narrower in scope than the worst-case scenario Hahn and others had assumed was true.
Cigna said it will only review claims by roughly 1% of doctors in its network who “records indicate as having a consistent pattern of coding at a higher [level] for routine visits compared to their peers,” including those who, for example, bill diagnoses such as “earache” or “sore throat” as Level 4 or 5 visits. 
Cigna’s initial announcement did not contain details about the scope of the new policy, like how many providers would be impacted and what share of visits would be downcoded.
Hahn said that lack of detail caused panic and confusion, particularly among small, independent providers, like himself. Hahn estimates he already spends “probably a full day a week” devoted to “fighting with insurance companies,” and worries the policy would only exacerbate that burden. 
Cigna has already sent notifications to any provider that will be impacted by the new policy, Sessions, the company’s spokesperson, confirmed. Sessions did not respond to a question about  how many doctors in Connecticut would be impacted.
Blando, the spokesperson for Aetna, declined to respond to questions regarding details about the scope of the policy similar to the details provided by Cigna.
Hahn said that as of Sept. 19, he had not received direct communication from Cigna that his claims would get reviewed under the new policy. 
David Eagle, an oncologist based in New York, said that while the September announcement provided clarification, he still finds the policy problematic. Eagle agreed that insurers are perfectly within their rights to audit physician billing practices. But, he said, there’s a right way to do it, and this isn’t it.
Cigna is making reimbursement decisions based on claims filed, which don’t contain all the information necessary to appropriately assess the complexity of a visit, Eagle said. Instead, the company should be using medical records.
“You’re just using the wrong information set. And then it’s the problem of the physician to fight back, claim by claim, visit by visit, to get paid appropriately,” Eagle said.
Eagle said insurers have a responsibility to ensure their auditing policies are designed correctly because denials cause more work for physicians and delays in care for patients.
When faced with prior authorization requests from insurers, “everybody has to scramble on the medical side after the fact to explain and justify treatment for cancer patients, so it causes delays in treatments. And so much extra work,” Eagle said.
Mark Camel, a retired neurosurgeon and co-founder of the Greenwich-based Orthopaedic and Neurosurgery Specialists, said it’s also important that, when determining which physicians to include in the policy, Cigna compares providers to peers in the same speciality. An oncologist who sees a complex patient base and is more likely to have Level 4 or 5 visits shouldn’t be compared to an orthopedic surgeon, whose patients include people who come in with knee pain, Camel said.
Camel said the policy is “okay as long as each physician is compared within their specialty because of the variation of types of visits.” 
A representative from the Connecticut State Medical Society provided comment regarding Cigna’s initial policy but could not be reached for follow-up comment regarding the insurer’s updated policy. 
In a statement, the Connecticut Hospital Association also called for the reversal of the policies.
“We have concerns that these new policies will create uncertainty for providers and patients and add significant administrative burden and cost. They should be rescinded. Clear, transparent policies are essential to supporting fair reimbursement and ensuring patients’ continued access to care,” Nicole Rall, a CHA spokesperson, stated in emailed comments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOWNCODING-0916024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state without maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid make maternal health care access in Massachusetts something that stands to get worse.,"SOME EMERGENCY RESPONDERS go years, decades, or even their entire careers without ever having to deliver a baby in an ambulance. For John Cuddahy, it took just a few months.  
The Leominster-based firefighter EMT completed his academy training in April, and this summer responded to a call in Leominster of a woman in active labor.  
“She was in the middle of her contractions, so we loaded her up as quick as we could and started driving out to Worcester,” Cuddahy said.  
But 10 minutes into the 20-mile drive to UMass Memorial Medical Center, the baby was delivered.  
In those critical minutes, they could have gotten the expecting mother to UMass Memorial Health Alliance-Clinton Hospital in Leominster, but its maternity unit closed two years ago, ruling that option out. 
Luckily there were no serious complications, and both patients were healthy when they finally arrived at the hospital. Cuddahy delivered the baby along with a paramedic of nearly 30 years. It was a first for both responders, but likely not their last.  
“I think it’s something to expect a lot more now that there is no maternity [unit] in Leominster. We almost had another one two shifts ago,” Cuddahy said. “It would save a lot of in-the-field deliveries if they still had it there.”

Reports of women giving birth in cars, ambulances, emergency departments, or reaching a maternity unit just in time to deliver are a far cry from what is expected in a state that consistently ranks first in the country for its health care system. 
But in North-Central Massachusetts, pregnant women and families are living a reality that data, statistics, and health care rankings don’t always show. 
Two years after the maternity unit at Clinton Hospital closed, the region is struggling. The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state that technically, according to the nonprofit advocacy and maternal health research group March of Dimes, doesn’t have maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid will make it harder to access maternal health care in Massachusetts.
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity unit services, according to Health Policy Commission data. Two birth centers in Beverly and Holyoke have also closed, leaving Massachusetts with just one free-standing birth center.  
The loss of maternity units and obstetric care is a trend seen nationwide. But while most states have at least one, if not multiple maternity care deserts – counties without hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and no obstetric providers – Massachusetts has none, according to March of Dimes. 
“The rate of closure is very similar for us as it is in other states,” said Chloe Schwartz, Massachusetts director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes. “The only difference being, we started with more to begin with, so we don’t have any official deserts yet.” 
Each county in Massachusetts has been deemed “full access” by March of Dimes, meaning it has two or more hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and 60 or more obstetric clinicians per 10,000 births.  
“We have a standardized definition, but the folks living and working on the ground will tell you a very different story about the reality of access,” Schwartz said. “Changing access is just as difficult as having little to no access. It’s whiplash.”  
Schwartz warned that the Bay State is in a precarious position when it comes to maternity care, pointing to recent service closures and reports of UMass Memorial Health’s financial stress. 
Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, recently closed two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March – and will soon close an adult behavioral health program in Fitchburg. The system has halted hiring for all nonclinical and non-patient-facing roles and faced an $86 million operating loss in the first half of fiscal year 2025, the Boston Globe reported. 
As health care providers face an impending decrease in Medicaid payments because of the sweeping tax bill passed by Republicans, more closures could be on the horizon.  
“It’s an ever-changing landscape, and there’s so many ways in which these hospitals and health systems have to pivot, and unfortunately, maternity care is one of those areas that’s always going to be the hardest to keep open,” Schwartz said.  
More of the region’s births are now taking place at UMass Memorial’s main campus in Worcester. The facility has increased the number of labor and delivery staff “to meet the modest increase in patient volume,” said Shelly Hazlett, the hospital’s director of media and public relations, in a statement.

But maternity deserts are only designated at the county level, which doesn’t do enough to illustrate accessibility in cities and smaller areas, according to Hao Yu, associate professor of health care policy in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  
“When we talk about health care access, that’s really a local issue,” Yu said.  
In Massachusetts, the ratio of OB-GYNs per 10,000 births decreased in rural counties from nearly 162 in 2010 to 87 in 2021, while the ratio increased in urban counties in that same timeframe, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. 
Obstetric services are often not financially advantageous for hospitals due to low reimbursement rates from Medicaid, which pays for about a third of all births in Massachusetts.  
As federal cuts to Medicaid roll out after the midterm elections, Massachusetts could see even more maternity unit closures, according to Yu. Community hospitals serving low-income areas will be most at risk. “If federal support for Medicaid is going to be decreased substantially, then state governments will have difficulty maintaining their current reimbursement rate,” he said.  
OB-GYNs have one of the highest malpractice insurance premiums across all medical specialties due to a high risk of lawsuits. And, maintaining operations amid a workforce shortage is costly due to round-the-clock staffing requirements in maternity units, including OB-GYNs, nurse midwives, anesthesiologists, and other supporting staff.  
“The cost of maintaining OB units is high. On the other hand, the reimbursement from the payers for this type of service is low,” Yu said. “Putting these two together, you can imagine it’s really making OB units the easy target if hospitals want to downsize.”  
While 11 closures may not seem like a significant amount, Yu noted it represents about five percent of all obstetric unit closures that have occurred in the US in the last decade. Meanwhile, Massachusetts accounts for just two percent of the US population.  
Maternity patients in 29 municipalities increased their distance traveled by at least 5 miles between 2011 and 2021, and 14 of those communities increased their distance traveled by at least 10 miles, according to the Department of Public Health’s 2023 review of maternal health services. Only two towns – Newburyport and West Newbury – out of 351 municipalities – have residents whose average travel distance to birthing facilities decreased in the past decade. 
While they may not live in a “desert,” expecting mothers and families are driving further and further to receive care, and each closure brings more ambulance, roadside, and emergency room deliveries, meaning a delay in treatment for some of the most common complications like premature delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal hyperthermia. “Those types of births will surely be associated with adverse outcomes, both for babies and for mothers,” Yu said.
The decision to close the Leominster maternity unit in September 2023 took local leaders like Mayor Dean Mazzarella by surprise. Mazzarella, who fought alongside other leaders, residents, and health care workers to keep the unit open, said the city was notified of these problems years too late.  
“This stuff doesn’t happen overnight, so the Department of Public Health needs to do better monitoring,” Mazzarella said in an interview. “When [the UMass] Health Alliance started seeing a problem with this, they should have reported it to the Department of Public Health. We should have had these meetings then.”  
UMass Memorial officials noted that workforce shortages and declining births at Clinton contributed to the decision to shut down the maternity unit. These issues “had a significant impact on our unit’s ability to provide the best possible labor and delivery care to our patients,” Hazlett said. 
The maternity unit closure came five years after the hospital closed its 11-bed pediatric unit in 2018.  
Mazzarella, who has served as mayor since 1994 when Leominster Hospital and Burbank Hospital merged to form Health Alliance, said the Leominster campus was meant to be a strong regional hospital offering a comprehensive set of services. (UMass Memorial purchased Health Alliance in 1998 and merged the hospital with Clinton in 2017.) Now, he sees that slipping away. 
“It’s like this big network that had been established for so long is now being pulled apart in fragments,” he said. “Whether it’s a desert or not, it was certainly filling a gap at the time.”

Maternity patients have been absorbed by surrounding centers, including Henry Heywood Hospital, Emerson Hospital, or UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, which are approximately 15, 23, and 25 miles away from Clinton Hospital by car. Distance is a barrier to many pregnant patients, Mazzarella said, who used to be just a bus ride away from their obstetric care unit.  
Leominster Fire Chief Robert Sideleau called it a “tremendous loss.” His team of firefighter EMTs and paramedics have delivered an increasing number of babies in ambulances. At Clinton Hospital, emergency room secretary Shelly Roy says women have given birth in the ER because they couldn’t make it to UMass Memorial in Worchester. 
Their roadside and ambulance deliveries have been free from serious complications so far, according to Sideleau, but it’s not a matter of “if” but “when.” He worries about emergency staff having to decide between transporting high-risk patients to Leominster’s emergency room to deliver without an OB-GYN or taking a chance to transport them to UMass Memorial in Worcester.  
“That’s what makes us nervous,” Sideleau said. “If there’s a prolapsed cord or breach birth, and we were able to bring them to Leominster and right up to an OB-GYN doctor, it could make the difference between life and death.” 
The loss of the labor and delivery unit has been complicated by the closure of another community hospital – Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer – in 2024. The region’s emergency medical services have since been stretched thin.  
Traveling longer distances to surrounding hospitals means staff and ambulances are away from their stations for longer periods of time. Waiting to unload patients at crowded emergency departments only adds to the delay. Leominster’s fire department often responds to mutual aid requests from Ayer, which also means less time spent in their area. 
“If there’s another ambulance call, and we don’t have an ambulance available, then we have to call mutual aid, and it just starts the whole round robin,” Sideleau said. “The less resources up here, the busier we get.”

Amy Gagnon, a former labor and delivery nurse at Clinton Hospital who now works at Henry Heywood Hospital, said she couldn’t sleep for weeks after the closure. She worries for the future of maternal health access in the region. “If anything happens to Heywood, this whole area will be a desert,” she said.  
For months after the closure, Gagnon said Leominster patients came to deliver at Heywood but hadn’t received prenatal care there. Medical staff knew very little about their pregnancy history and due dates. Without access to their prenatal records, providers can’t anticipate complications or be ready for necessary inductions based on preexisting conditions.  
“It was hard in the beginning, because we weren’t prepared staff wise,” she said. “We only have three nurses.”  
At the time of the closure, DPH determined that the unit was an essential service “necessary for preserving access and health status within the hospital’s service area.” Beyond that recognition, the state has little authority over hospitals and service closures.  
“This feels inherently broken … When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” State Rep. Natalie Higgins
“If the Department of Health determines that a service is essential to the health and safety of a community, why in the world do we agree to exist in a system that lets it close down?” Rep. Natalie Higgins, who represents Leominster, said in an interview.  
After the closure, Higgins authored legislation that would prevent hospitals from closing a service for three years after DPH deems it “essential.” The bill – which failed but was reintroduced in January and has yet to make its way through the legislature – did not specify if the state would help keep a service open if the hospital cites financial reasons for the proposed closure. Higgins called it a “big ask.”  
Lawmakers have also introduced a bill that instructs the attorney general to seek an injunction to keep essential services open during a required one-year notice period. It would require hospitals seeking a service closure to notify any affected cities or towns and prohibit them from applying for a new license or expanding for three years after a service or facility is closed. The current legislation has yet to pass but is scheduled for a hearing at the end of the month. 
The maternity unit was one of four essential service closures in and around Leominster in the last eight years. Higgins is worried her community will stop showing up to the closure hearings. “It’s feeling pretty futile.”  
“This feels inherently broken,” she said. “When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” 
Emerging research has shown that birth centers and midwifery care are safe, lower-cost, and desired options for labor and delivery. They also have the potential to absorb patients that have otherwise lost access to a maternity unit or prefer not to give birth in a hospital.   
Seven Sisters Midwifery in Northampton is currently the only free-standing birth center in Massachusetts. Ginny Miller, the center’s owner, said patients drive from all over the state, as well as from bordering states, for care. They currently have a waiting list for pregnancy care and delivery until May 2026.  
New Hampshire, a state with one fifth the population of Massachusetts, is home to three independent birthing centers.  
By share of total deliveries occurring in birth centers, Massachusetts ranks 35th out of the 44 states where birth centers are available. The Health Policy Commission asserts that about 25 percent of births in Massachusetts hospitals are low-risk deliveries that could qualify for birth center care. 
But one challenge that comes with the establishment of community birth centers is that they must be within reasonable distance of a hospital with a labor and delivery unit in the event of major complications. That could rule out cities like Leominster and Fitchburg if potential centers determine that the nearest maternity hospital is too far away. 
Emily Anesta, co-founder of the Bay State Birth Coalition, called birth centers “a necessity.” Massachusetts has one of the highest rates of severe maternal morbidity – unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that can result in short- or long-term health consequences – ranking 45th in the country according to the Commonwealth Fund. A 2023 DPH report showed that the prevalence of severe maternal morbidity nearly doubled in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2020.  
“Hospital care is not what everyone needs. Midwifery care is not just something people like. … It really is lifesaving,” Anesta said. “To have that access denied for most people currently in Massachusetts is not actually giving people access to the care that they need.” 
Low insurance reimbursement rates and a lack of licensing have prevented birth centers from operating in Massachusetts, making it an uncommon, expensive option for pregnant patients. Nurse midwives are not reimbursed at the same rate as physicians and OB-GYNs, meaning hospitals and other health care centers aren’t incentivized to build or expand their midwife programs. 
In August 2024, Gov. Maura Healey signed a maternal health bill mainly providing a pathway to licensure for certified professional midwives that advocates had long called for. The legislation also requires MassHealth to cover midwifery and doula services for up to 12 months postpartum. The licensing changes have yet to be fully implemented. 
“Until that’s in place, and until private insurers also cover that care, most families wouldn’t be able to afford to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5,000 out of pocket for their maternity care,” Anesta said. “If they went to a hospital, they would be paying less out of pocket or nothing out of pocket, depending on what type of insurance plan they have. It becomes more of a luxury option that’s inaccessible to most.” 
A state like Massachusetts, still ranked first in the country for women’s health and reproductive care, ought to be doing better, Anesta said. 
“People deserve access to options,” she added. “They deserve care that’s in their communities that feels safe and comfortable to them.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Republican leaders made it clear the first deadline of Sept. 30 to adopt a bipartisan map would not be met.
During the four-hour meeting of the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, defended the proposal introduced by House Democrats, with fellow legislators on the Ohio Senate side bringing forward its companion bill.
The proposals from Democrats, introduced Sept. 9, lay out eight Republican-leaning congressional districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts in a map they say is aligned with voter trends for the last 10 years.
Isaacsohn said the map meets the constitutional rules to keep districts compact and communities of interest together as much as possible, adding that it “forces competitive races, and it forces communities not to be taken for granted.”
He said he’s open to counter-proposals from the Republicans on the map, as long as the redistricting process leads to a constitutional map that gives Ohio the representation it deserves.
“When we have gerrymandering that unduly favors one party or another, it leads to policies that hurt most people, that are out of touch with where Ohioans are and what they need,” Isaacsohn said.
Committee co-chair Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Twp., claimed the constitutional rule that a map can’t unduly favor one political party is in the “third silo” of the process, only coming into play if there is no bipartisan agreement.
Currently, Ohio’s congressional map has 10 Republican members of Congress and five Democrats. That map was passed without bipartisan support in March 2022, bringing the process back this year to activate maps for the next election cycle.
The Republican caucus hasn’t proposed a map yet. Timken said the legislative caucus is working on a proposal.
“Republicans will be following the constitution, and when we propose our map, I’m sure we will make it public,” Timken said.
But Timken doesn’t agree with the 55%-45% breakdown that Democrats and their map supporters used as a baseline for a “fair” map.
“I question their logic as to why it has to be 55-45, when clearly the voters of Ohio have strongly supported Republicans over the last decade, and so, in my opinion, I do not believe the 55-45 is accurate,” she told reporters after the meeting.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Congressional maps often use the most recent presidential election as a guide, along with the last decade’s voting trends. In 2024, President Donald Trump won Ohio with 55% of the vote.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, echoed Isaacsohn’s call for productive collaboration in creating “districts that mirror the political reality of our state,” saying he would be willing to change the political breakdown if it meant the fair representation was maintained.
“If (the maps) are 9-6 and they’re constitutionally fair, I know our caucus will consider those maps,” DeMora said.
The Columbus Democrat said he’s held “more than 20 meetings” in his office with constituents talking about redistricting.
Ohioans who spoke at the meeting supported the Democratic proposal, emphasizing the need for representation that is responsive to voters, something they feel more competitive districts and a transparent redistricting process can do.
“(We have) politicians who don’t answer the phone because they don’t need to,” said the Rev. Dr. Aileen Maddox, a Dayton resident. “Their seats are safe, not because we put them there, but because the lines were drawn to keep them there.”
Maddox told the committee fair districts would bring voices to policymaking that understand the issues that Dayton residents deal with, including people of color, immigrants and all other residents.
“We could elect leaders who come from our neighborhoods, who understand the pain of losing a child too soon, who know what it means to work two jobs and still struggle to afford a prescription, and the daily lives of the people who suffer from the multiplicity of the above,” Maddox said.
As supporters of the Democratic proposal spoke on the merits of the map, they also pointed the finger at Republicans for a lack of movement in proposing a map or holding hearings before Monday.
Sen. Willis Blackshear, Jr., D-Dayton, thanked Ohioans who attended the meeting, calling their attendance “a real testament to democracy.”
“We were only given two business days notice that this opportunity to testify would arise, so it makes it even more special to see so many folks here rising to the occasion,” Blackshear said.
The senator pushed for the committee to work hard to hit the deadline of Sept. 30 for legislative action and “respect the urgency that is required.”
“If voters didn’t want September action, there’d be no process,” Blackshear told the committee. “If voters and our fellows legislators hadn’t intended us to take real, meaningful bipartisan action in September, they wouldn’t have created a detailed process for us to do just that.”
Republican co-chair Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, expressed doubts as to the discussion around the Sept. 30 deadline noted in state law as a final deadline for legislators.
“September 30th is in there, and yet, the constitution provides for a process if we don’t meet that,” Bird said. “And obviously we’re not, because we have ‘if needed’ sessions that have been determined to not be needed.”
Both Bird and Timken said the constitutional deadlines go through November, and they don’t feel rushed to make a decision before the end of the process.
“We can continue the process of gathering input from Ohioans, we can continue the process of negotiating with Democrats and we can pass a bipartisan map at any time in the next couple of months,” Bird said.
If the legislature doesn’t come to the 66% agreement in both chambers on a map by Sept. 30, the process moves to the Republican-majority led Ohio Redistricting Commission, who then have until Oct. 30 to come to a bipartisan decision.
If they don’t have the votes to do so, the Ohio General Assembly has another crack at it, with a deadline of Nov. 30.
The legislature would no longer have to have a bipartisan agreement at that time, only needing a simple majority to pass a map that would last for four years.
That simple majority agreement must come alongside a map that has certain other requirements.
The Republican committee chairs placed some of the blame on Democrats, who they said were resolute in their goal of a map with eight Republicans and seven Democrats.
“If an eight to seven map is the only one acceptable, then how are we going to get that done by September 30th,” Bird said. “It makes it very unlikely and it pushes the envelope to a potential November vote.”
The eight GOP members of the joint committee all questioned the Democratic map, with some accusing map-drawers and the legislators who are standing behind the map of pushing the map to deliberately give Democrats more seats.
“It seems to me it’s only gerrymandering if the Republicans win,” said state Rep. Brian Stewart.
Whether or not a map is adopted in September or in November, Blackshear said the renewed redistricting process should be treated as a model for the rest of the country in shirking political differences, and bringing together an effort that represents the people of Ohio.
“We can’t use (political power) as a bail-out to do what’s right for the people of Ohio, because the people of Ohio deserve fair representation,” Blackshear said.
No other hearings have been scheduled, but Timken said one more will be coming up.
She and Bird said it would occur next week, to give more of the public the chance to give input.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th. 
In America, diapers have long been treated as a luxury good rather than a necessity.
Half of families with young kids struggle to afford all the diapers they need. A quarter of families miss work as a result, often because they don’t have enough diapers to send with their children to child care.
It’s a largely invisible issue with enormous consequences for the health of parents and children. Studies have found that diaper need is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food insecurity and housing instability. And when parents don’t have enough diapers, they make do with sanitary pads, rags or other materials. Some report having to leave their children in soiled diapers for extended periods, raising the risk for urinary tract infections and diaper rash.
So Amy Kadens, who has worked in the diaper space for nearly 15 years, wondered: What if diapers were free for the parents who need them most? For decades, the United States has not had a good answer. So she came up with her own.
Diaper banks started popping up across the nation in 2011, collecting donations and dispersing diapers to families through a complex network of local partnerships. They are one of the few lifelines for parents.
Kadens, who co-founded a nonprofit that provides diapers called Share our Spare in 2011, knew that diaper banks often operate with limited staff and resources, and operationally can only address a small percentage of a massive need. Without more government support, they can only get at a slice of the problem.
Federal assistance programs that help low-income families, such as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), have never allowed families to use those funds to purchase diapers.
“Diaper banks are doing heroic work with very little. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” Kadens said. But, “I wanted to continue to sink my teeth into this.”
So Kadens started to work on a solution that could give people the funds to get whatever diapers they needed, without the warehouses to store donations or the teams to get those donations out.
That solution was Diaper Dollars, a $40 e-card that users get in their email every month. The virtual card comes with a barcode they can scan at checkout at most major retailers, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, that will cover the cost of diapers. So far, users in Illinois and Ohio can access the program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The idea, Kadens said, was to make it as simple as possible, while also giving parents the ability to choose what brands they preferred.
“Families have brand loyalty,” Kadens said. “I wanted to keep dignity and choice at the forefront of everything we did.”
The Diaper Dollars team went through months of market research to refine the tech to work well for participants. They didn’t want coupons because there was too much fraud in the system, and gift cards meant users could be limited on where to shop.
Instead, they landed on a system that allowed them to build out a catalog of diapers at 6,200 retail locations in the country. The bar code on the digital card recognizes the diapers when it’s scanned and deducts the price from the total purchase. That catalog of diapers is monitored daily and updated in case brands come out with new box sizes or products. It also works for online purchases.
The system does have some limitations. It’s not valid in Amazon or Target, two retailers that don’t yet accept that form of payment. And it also likely only covers a portion of the need: The average family spends about $100 on diapers a month, but families earning a median income can only afford to cover about $65, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It’s also more expensive — parents are paying retail prices plus sales tax (23 states charge sales tax on diapers, including Illinois). By contrast, products at diaper banks are donated or sold to the banks from the manufacturer at deeply discounted rates.
To find participants, Diaper Dollars partners with organizations such as WIC clinics and local hospitals to refer people to the program, which is funded from a mix of philanthropy and financial support from those same partners. Partners establish the eligibility criteria, how long participants can be a part of the program, and whether the stipend will be higher for those with multiple babies.
A pilot program launched in 2023 with 100 people, then in 2024 the Illinois Department of Human Services dedicated $1 million to run its own pilot at a larger scale. Nearly 8,000 people have been served so far, with 10,000 projected by 2026.
Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told The 19th that she had been looking for solutions that could support people in the postpartum period, when maternal mortality is high, particularly for Black women. Diaper need, specifically, is linked to maternal mental health and considered a potential risk factor for moderate to high maternal depressive symptoms.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For White women it was 14.5 deaths.
So when Illinois launched a birth equity initiative to address the needs of postpartum parents, from a home visiting program to better diaper access, it chose to partner with Diaper Dollars.
“Giving someone a card where they can go to the store of their choice, decide what’s best, that is what’s part of dignity,” Stratton said. “Every woman deserves to bring life into this world safely and with dignity.”
Brendan Kitt, Diaper Dollars’ program director, said the program was able to offer an operational solution to a problem the state wanted to address but didn’t have a mechanism for. The system works similarly to a universal basic income, where people in need are given a cash stipend, but it’s more targeted.
“Both for funders and supporters, it’s always a question when you talk to people about where the money goes,” he said. “The fact that we can limit the transactions to the specific needs that we’re trying to serve, I think, is one of the biggest things that legitimized our operation over just giving basic cash assistance.”
Parents who benefited from Diaper Dollars told the organization in testimonials that they’ve had to turn to using underwear or old T-shirts when they didn’t have the money for diapers, often making decisions between paying for rent or diapers.
After going through the program, parents reported that the funds gave them the wiggle room to buy their children other essentials or to make them better meals.
About 90 percent of those who went through the program reported being able to better afford essentials like food, rent and other bills. Some 95 percent felt less stressed about not having enough diapers.
Joanne Samuel Goldblum, the CEO of the National Diaper Bank Network, which has more than 240 partners nationwide, said a model like Diaper Dollars can address unmet needs, particularly in rural areas where it’s harder for diaper banks to distribute products.
“The need is really so big, and it’s not going to be addressed through just one sort of answer or one type of program,” Samuel Goldblum said. “It’s really important to have ways to reach people in all sorts of different communities.”
The Diaper Dollars program has raised about $2 million so far — 45 percent from the state of Illinois, 35 percent from philanthropic donors and 20 percent from grants from community partners. It is now also running in Ohio and expected to expand to Washington soon.
Kadens’ dream is to take the program to every state. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and some red states instituted abortion bans, conservative lawmakers have been looking for ways to support postpartum parents.
In Tennessee, for example, where abortion was banned in 2022, the state rolled out a new policy in 2024 that allowed families enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid program to receive up to 100 free diapers a month for the first two years of life.
Samuel Goldblum said the National Diaper Bank Network has seen more bipartisan support for addressing diaper needs this year “than we’ve ever seen before.”
It should be that simple, Kadens said: “It doesn’t matter if you’re blue or red. Babies need diapers.”

(Getty Images)I have been so impressed with the good work of Alabama attorney Bryan Stevenson, especially his work going into prisons to help people who have been falsely accused and his work with young teenagers. He is a kind and compassionate soul, and in fact I just received a thank-you note from the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, thanking me for my small donation to their work.
Here in Kansas, the Wichita-based Progeny is a wonderful nonprofit organization that helps young adults in the foster care system and who have been in the juvenile justice system. According to their website, it is a “youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and reinvestment into community based alternatives.”
Progeny is a program of Destination Innovation, which helps underserved communities. I happened upon Progeny one day and watched a video of legislative testimony from Desmond Bryan White, who had served time in the juvenile justice system and was testifying about how fines and fees had affected his life, even his now adult life. I couldn’t believe that youths were charged fines and fees that saddled them with debt and despair. It seemed horrific.
Another group that works to help advocate for youths is Kansas Appleseed. They contribute statewide but are based in Lawrence. They help youths in the foster care system.
Too many young people in the foster system are abused and mistreated. They hardly have a chance at gaining a normal and nurturing childhood. Too many times, this results in being caught up in the juvenile justice system. It’s sad to me. It should be sad to everyone.
I grew up attending a private school, where I was loved and nurtured. The parents were highly involved in the process of learning for their children and we grew up knowing and feeling love and compassion. Many of my friends grew up to be attorneys, doctors, nurses and other important professions.
Youths growing up in poverty have the cards stacked against them. Too often in life, one’s ZIP code determines his or her success. At Progeny, youths are trying to reach out to other youths to help them overcome barriers to success and productivity. Those at Progeny are special and, I believe, the children of a God who loves them.
We need other alternatives and solutions for young people, rather than incarceration or punitive measures that leave everyone worse off. I guess incarceration can be the answer on occasion, but many times other forms of rehabilitation should occur instead. Pastors, rabbis and other faith leaders can get involved and have contributed to the juvenile justice issue in the past.
Should we be locking up young adults when helping them heal from past trauma can also be beneficial? I believe that there are many who care for Kansas youths. It’s time for all of us to reach out and show compassion to the children and teens struggling so much today. These are special people who need a little help and a little hope.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Great Ohio Gerrymandering Farce has lifted its curtain once again at the Ohio Statehouse odditorium of human wonders in scenic downtown Columbus.
Ohio politicians are once again pretending to be responsible stewards of the public interest and the Ohio Constitution, as though we all have amnesia and can’t remember what happened with Ohio gerrymandering in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
Instead of abiding by the will of Ohio voters and ending gerrymandering, Ohio Republican politicians executed a blatant run-out-the-clock strategy defying court rulings and imposing unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps regardless.
Ohio gerrymandering: A brief and awful history of the very recent past

Ohio Republican candidates have received an average of 56% support in the last 10 years of statewide elections, but after refusing to draw fair and constitutional maps Ohio Republican politicians control 66% of the state’s U.S. Congressional seats, 67% of the Ohio House, and 79% of the Ohio Senate.
To cap it off in 2024, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose shamelessly abused his position as chief elections officer on a citizens amendment proposing to kick politicians out of the redistricting process.
LaRose and Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board wrote ballot language for the amendment — an amendment LaRose publicly opposed — claiming that the citizen-led anti-gerrymandering amendment would actually require gerrymandering.
That was a politician abusing the public trust to put his thumb on the scale of an amendment petitioned by more than 535,000 Ohio citizens.
As dirty as politics is, sticking your finger in the eye of more than 535,000 voters on a deeply serious and foundational question about elections and the Ohio Constitution is about as low as it gets.
Confused Ohio voters shot down the amendment and left Ohio politicians in charge of drawing political districts for themselves and their fellow politicians.
Anti-gerrymandering groups warn that Ohio’s ballot language is misleading voters

Ohio Republican Party Chair Alex Triantifilou has since openly admitted that the strategy to confuse Ohio voters helped defeat the amendment: “Confusion means we don’t know, so we did our job,” Triantafilou is quoted as saying.
Ohioans should remember that our state’s current U.S. House districts are unconstitutionally gerrymandered already, as they stand now.
They were drawn by Republicans in 2022 without bipartisan support to give Republicans 10 safe U.S. House seats out of 15.
A bipartisan majority on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 rejected the Republican-drawn U.S. Congressional district map as unconstitutionally gerrymandered two separate times.
That was the last time a court ruled on the U.S. House map that Ohio voters have been forced to use since.
In a state that Trump won with 55% of the vote in 2024, and Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno won with 50% of the vote in 2024, Republicans control 66% of Ohio’s U.S. House districts.
Now Moreno is calling for them to increase that to 80%, or 12-3.
Other Republicans are calling for 13-2, which would be 87% Republican.
That would be cheating to steal 31% representation — stealing honest elections and representation from nearly 3.5 million Ohio residents.

Under the amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018, politician were left in charge of the process for Congressional district mapmaking.
In 2024, politicians did their best to confuse voters, and Ohio voters once again decided to leave politicians in charge.
So now, under the same old process they abused last time, Ohio politicians will conduct another gerrymandering farce.
First the Statehouse lawmakers get a crack at drawing a map and must pass one with three-fifths of both chambers of the supermajority Republican legislature, including at least half of Democrats.
If lawmakers fail to do that by Sept. 30, the process is kicked over to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, which Republican politicians control 5-2: the governor, auditor, secretary of state, and four lawmakers, one from each party in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate.
If the Ohio Redistricting Commission fails to reach a bipartisan agreement on a map by Oct. 31, the process gets kicked back over to lawmakers, who then have until Nov. 30 to pass a map with a simple majority.
Remember, Republicans control gerrymandered supermajorities in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate.
Will politicians keep Ohio gerrymandered 10-5? Will they gerrymander more, to 11-4, or to 12-3, or to 13-2?
Who knows?
The only thing I can guarantee you is that Ohio voters will not get fair, competitive maps.
Ohio politicians will continue to make sure their fellow politicians can not be held accountable to Ohio voters in November elections.
In 2026, Ohio voters will see a November election where out of 15 Ohio U.S. House races, maybe two will be competitive, if that.
And the vast majority of the politicians will just waltz back into office, campaign pockets stuffed with special interest money, never having to worry about Ohio voters at all.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds of new state laws took effect on Wednesday, including measures that add protections from scams and fees for ticketbuyers, increase taxes on cigarettes, and allow health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to remove their names from the medication’s label, among other things. 
Unless otherwise stipulated, all non-emergency laws passed during the last legislative session took effect, as Wednesday marks 90 days since adjournment on June 25. 
Several new laws have impacts on Mainers’ everyday lives, such as changes to the tax code, labor laws and health care funding. Others are more symbolic. Maine now officially has a state amphibian (the Spring Peeper), state reptile (the wood turtle) and state dog (the Seppala Siberian Sleddog). 
Here are several ways state law has changed (the full list can be found here): 
Consumer protections 
A new law aims to protect ticket buyers from scams and fees. 
It requires ticket resellers to disclose fees up front, bans the use of fake websites and bots that circumvent online ticket limits, and prohibits resellers from adding more than 10% to the original ticket price.
This law started out as a proposal to allow the resale of tickets but was amended after strong opposition from local groups, such as the State Theatre and Portland Symphony Orchestra, which argued that it would benefit large resale platforms. 
Notably, ticket exchange and resale company StubHub supported the initial proposal, arguing it would help correct what it sees as a monopoly held by Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment — companies that the U.S. Department of Justice sued last year for that reason. 
Another similar new law prohibits those renting short-term lodging or selling an entertainment event ticket from advertising or offering a price that doesn’t include all mandatory fees or charges, aside from taxes or fees imposed by a government, shipping charges and charges for ancillary services, such as insurance on a product purchase. 
Tax changes
Among the laws that take effect on Wednesday is the state budget addition, which raised taxes on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes. 
Maine’s cigarette excise tax is increasing the most: from $2 a pack to $3.50 a pack.
Lawmakers also made a few tweaks to the Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re-use of historic buildings. 
The amount allocated wasn’t changed, but lawmakers extended the timeframe for accessing the credits and therefore increased the cap over that longer period. The idea is that this will remove the incentive for developers to delay or space out projects across multiple tax years and, in turn, help build more affordable housing quicker. Additionally, lawmakers increased this tax credit in rural areas as a means to incentivize the revival of Maine’s rural downtowns. 
And, after a 2022 change left out the Mi’kmaq Nation from reform, a new law now ensures equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations. 
Housing
In addition to those tax changes that incentivize housing development, other laws will help Mainers afford, and be able to remain in, housing. 
Maine lawmakers remove red tape to enable more affordable housing construction

Some of those changes were again made through the state budget, including increasing the real estate transfer tax on properties that sell for more than a million dollars and allocating that revenue to a dedicated fund for affordable housing.
Other new laws make comprehensive zoning changes to make it easier to build more units on the same lot, add restrictions for owners of manufactured housing communities to try to prevent excessive rent and fee increases, and help Maine workers afford housing and remain connected to employment by making targeted rental assistance available.
Protections for residents of mobile home parks also continued to be a focus of the Legislature. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a law that requires mobile home park owners to notify residents of their intent to sell and give them at least 60 days to make an offer. This year, a new law now gives a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. 
There are also several new laws that aim to help the unhoused. 
Municipalities can no longer ban homeless shelters. Some revenue from the real estate transfer tax will now be redirected to help sustain emergency homeless shelters. The state also allocated ongoing funds for rental assistance for homeless students. 
Health care 
Health care providers can now request their name be removed from labels on abortion medication. This type of law has emerged as a legislative trend across the country as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. 
State funding for family planning services has increased. These include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions.
The state budget and separate legislation together provide $6 million in one-time funding to providers of these services. 
Lisa Margulies, vice president of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said this funding is even more important in light of President Donald Trump’s cuts to sexual and reproductive health care.  
In July, U.S. Congress passed Trump’s spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning by prohibiting the health care providers from receiving reimbursement payments for non-abortion services provided to patients insured by Medicaid. Maine Family Planning sued over it, but a federal judge sustained the defunding in August. 
“Politicians in Washington aren’t stopping their attacks,” Margulies said in a statement. “They are singularly focused on shutting down any provider that legally offers abortion as a component of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care. Their actions have put access to care for everyone — especially our country’s most vulnerable — at risk.” 
Another new law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish licensing standards for urgent care facilities, which previously lacked such oversight for safety, transparency and quality of care.
Judiciary 
People under 18 years old are now prohibited from marrying. The state used to have exceptions. The minimum age was raised to 17, with parental consent required, in 2023. Before that, in 2020, the minimum was set at 16, again with parental consent required. 
Adults are now prohibited from doxing minors under state law, which also allows families to seek court action for targeted children. While the impetus for this legislation came from a doxing incident in 2023, the issue gained wider attention this year after the Maine House of Representatives censured Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) for posting about a transgender student athlete on social media. 
Lawmakers made only minimal changes to Maine’s indigent defense structure this year. 
Labor
Workers now have some new protections, such as a requirement of minimum pay for reporting to work.
Farmworkers have the right to state minimum wage like most other employees in Maine, after years of failed attempts. 
Lawmakers also tweaked the laws governing paid family and medical leave — creating enforcement mechanisms and penalties and clarifying definitions — but rejected any significant changes since the program hasn’t fully been implemented yet.  
Maine paid family and medical leave benefits are slated to become available in May 2026 and will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child.
Lawmakers also expanded the state’s child tax credit through the state budget. The Dependent Exemption Tax Credit was doubled per children under six years old. 
Environment and energy
While many bills environmental advocates pushed for this year remain unresolved, some changes started Wednesday.  
State law now outlines a goal for Maine to transition to 100% clean electricity by 2040, enshrining an earlier aim Gov. Janet Mills announced in 2023. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

Maine has led the country in establishing protections against per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS. One new law essentially codified what the state already does on a daily basis with its PFAS Response Program, including on-farm testing, crafting mitigation recommendations and providing financial support. On the other hand, Maine expanded the scope of vehicles and equipment exempt from notification requirements for the state’s first-in-the-nation PFAS reporting law.
Another law that took effect permits the transition of the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The elevation is seen by the governor and lawmakers as a way to set up a more integrated, comprehensive and consistent approach to managing Maine’s energy system. 
The state also enshrined the authority of the Public Utilities Commission to develop time-of-use rates, which aim to shift customers’ usage to periods of lower demand, for standard offer service. 
A look ahead 
On top of those bills that have now become law, the fate of 61 bills that the Maine Legislature passed this year will not be ultimately decided until next year. That’s because the governor opted to postpone her decisions on that legislation until lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Among these bills are proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
The 61 bills being held are in addition to the nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. While some of those bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. 
That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on the appropriations and study tables, which had largely passed the full Legislature but needed to still be funded or staffed.

More states are considering regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)You’ve seen the headlines: college students are outsourcing their education to AI tools.
The early anecdotes, research and surveys raise valid concerns, but this narrative is too quick to paint a picture of a technology undermining academic integrity, eroding critical thinking or even replacing the role of educators or universities altogether.
I lead the University of Nebraska at Omaha as its chancellor, and I see a different story. It wasn’t long ago that calculators raised questions about academic rigor in math classrooms. Some of us are old enough to remember how “CliffsNotes” was a dirty word in writing courses.
The emergence of the internet and Wikipedia once stirred fears about plagiarism. If you go far back enough, even Socrates had his concerns about the written word, saying “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Sound familiar?
History shows us the only constant in education is new technology will emerge that forces us to confront how we teach, work and learn. History also shows us that every disruptive technology provides an opportunity to evolve education and improve lives.
Our challenge and our responsibility is to guide students to use these technologies responsibly, ethically and productively while positioning them to navigate technological revolutions successfully.
It’s why UNO in the last year alone has launched an AI Learning Lab, partnered with Open AI on a ChatGPT enterprise solution for our campus and established one of the nation’s first undergraduate degrees in artificial intelligence.
It’s also why we are inviting the community to learn about the practical ways they can use generative AI at our OMA x AI event in October. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that as an institution, we don’t view AI as a threat, but as a tool that can deepen learning, expand opportunity and strengthen workforce readiness.
First, AI can help students succeed in their academic journey. Adaptive learning platforms powered by AI can provide personalized tutoring, helping identify when a student is struggling and offering targeted resources to get them back on track. For first-generation students, working parents or learners from any number of social or economic backgrounds, AI can be a powerful equalizer, offering support that makes higher education more achievable.
Second, AI is already reshaping the workforce our students will enter. From healthcare and logistics to business and the arts, employers are seeking graduates who are comfortable using AI-enabled tools to maximize their human creativity. If universities shy away from this, we risk sending students into the job market unprepared.
Third, we must prepare students with skills and experiences that AI cannot easily replicate. Critical thinking, ethical reasoning, leadership, empathy and the ability to work collaboratively are all competencies that remain uniquely human, and they will only grow in value as AI becomes more prevalent.
This means connecting students to experiential learning opportunities like internships, service learning and community-based research, in which human judgment and creativity are essential. It also means evolving how we teach so students can pair technical skills with AI-resistant strengths. This could look like a business major learning both data analytics and communication skills so they can lead teams and close deals or a fine arts student exploring digital design alongside creative expression that AI cannot imitate. By blending innovation with timeless human skills, we give students a competitive edge that endures beyond the latest technological shift.
Finally, AI opens doors for deeper community engagement and impact. As the leader of Nebraska’s public urban metropolitan university, it is my responsibility to ensure we are partnering with local industries, schools and civic leaders to ensure Omaha and Nebraska remain competitive. My counterparts at universities across the country share that responsibility. By embracing AI in teaching, learning, research and service, we can help tackle challenges in medicine, nutrition, community safety, business, teaching and so much more.
None of this means abandoning our responsibility to teach integrity, critical thinking and ethics. Students need to learn how to use AI, but also how to question it, validate it and apply it thoughtfully. That is the true work of higher education: not to avoid new technologies but to prepare students to navigate them wisely.
AI should not replace the human element of education. It should amplify it. By embracing this moment with optimism and responsibility, we can ensure that AI helps us do what we have always done best: empower students, strengthen communities and transform lives.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 04:01:18+00:00,CT Mirror,The rigging of American history,Thomas Cangelosi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/the-rigging-of-american-history-thomas/,Trump’s whitewashing of The Smithsonian exhibit is another part of the president’s racist campaign to repress the voice of minorities and erase their history.,"President Trump’s attack on The Smithsonian Institute for focusing too much on “how bad slavery was” is like criticizing the Bible for focusing too much on sin.  
Slavery is nothing less than America’s original sin, which all Americans have collectively inherited and whose lessons we’re responsible for learning.  It was slavery that triggered America’s internecine civil war whose scars remain today to remind us of our nation’s deeply racist wounds.
Yet even as Trump wants to distract us from “how bad slavery was,” he’d evidently prefer we focus on how great the Confederacy was, at least that’s what’s suggested by his executive order to restore a statue commemorating the Confederacy and honoring those who fought to preserve slavery. Ironically, it’s Trump’s “focus” on his authoritarian ambitions and racist convictions that distracts him from the point of both recorded history and America’s Constitutional purpose.
Indeed, during the course of his political life, Trump has tried to undermine America’s Constitutional purpose: “to create a more perfect union.”  Thus, in 2011 he lied that President Barack “Hussein” Obama was not an American citizen; in 2024 he lied that Kamala Harris was ineligible to run for president; and in 2025, he issued an executive order denying birthright citizenship for the babies of non-citizen parents, in defiance of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  
At every turn, Trump has tried to sabotage minority representation and inclusion.
Indeed, Trump’s anti-immigrant executive orders, policies, and rhetoric have also been aimed at people of color, like his first presidential campaign in 2015 when he coupled his slogan to “Make America Great Again” with his pledge to “build a great, great wall on our southern border.”  He claimed migrants from Mexico, were “bringing drugs.  They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” He added Haitians to his 2024 racist campaign when he falsely accused them of eating the pets of Ohioans.  And let’s not forget his first term ban on Muslim immigration, his complaint of migrants from “African shithole countries,” and his preference for immigrants from “nice,” predominantly white countries, “like Denmark [or] Switzerland.” 
Further, Trump falsely claimed he won the popular vote in 2016, “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.  And he claimed during his 2024 Presidential campaign that President Biden’s border policy was a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” by allowing immigrants to cross the border illegally and to register to vote.
Presently, the President’s attack on minorities includes ICE agents acting like racist brown shirts, arresting and deporting undocumented migrants without due process.  His overall strategy amounts to a campaign of vilification, disenfranchisement, and marginalization of people of color.  Simply, he believes a racially pluralist democracy spells the end of white majority rule and Republican election victories.
In fact, in 2020 Trump clearly admitted that if more Americans vote, Republicans will lose elections.  When Democrats wanted election reforms, like mail-in-voting, same day registration, and early voting to safely accommodate voters during the Covid pandemic, Trump objected: “The things they had in there were crazy.  They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”  
Though the American democratic experiment depended upon welcoming and absorbing cultures from around the world to peacefully co-exist in a unified nation, Trump intends to preserve a white electoral majority by disenfranchising minority voters and dividing the electorate.  It explains his lie that “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting,” and his ingenuous argument that “You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in…. it’s time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It’s the only way they can get elected.” Meanwhile, he never mentioned that he encouraged mail-in voting prior to his 2024 election, which he won.
But it’s not fraud Trump is worried about—it’s growing minority influence. He doesn’t believe that voting machines and mail in ballots are untrustworthy; he just wants to suppress the votes of those likely to oppose him.  He doesn’t believe the vote has been rigged against him; he just uses that false claim to distract his followers from his calculated campaign to rig the next election. He’s not concerned about inequality when he attacks and undermines DEI initiatives—what he fears is racial and democratic equality. So, when Trump claims he will make America Great Again, it means he will make it white again.
Trump’s whitewashing of The Smithsonian exhibit is another part of the president’s racist campaign to repress the voice of minorities and erase their history, amounting to nothing less than an act of American cultural genocide.  If the President doesn’t want to hear “how horrible our country is,” maybe he should not compound America’s original sin.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Some gravestones lie flat on the ground, leaves and twigs partially covering their weathered epitaphs, like the one for “Mark Davis of Baltimore, Died Feb. 3, 1885, Aged 13.”
In another section of woods, there aren’t even headstones: About 100 cinder blocks lined in rows mark the graves of some of the Black boys buried here from the 19th into the 20th centuries and largely forgotten, the cinder blocks sunken and visited only by bees.
That was the scene that greeted about a dozen members of the Legislative Black Caucus as they walked through heavy brush, weeds and thorny undergrowth to inspect graves of boys who died in what the old House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children in southern Prince George’s County.
The neglect of the boys’ graves is made more stark by the fact that it sits next to the pristine, manicured lawn of the Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery.
“I drive past this place every day, the pristine detail that’s taken in grave sites such as this,” state Sen. Michael Jackson (D-Prince George’s, Charles and Calvert) said of the veterans cemetery, before reflecting on the forgotten an overgrown graves of the boys.
“There is no reason to disrespect anyone,” said Jackson, whose district includes the graves. “We have a lot of work to do, folks.”

The folks he was addressing were the caucus members, who are already working on legislation to not only clean up the burial site “to bring dignity and care” to the boys’ lives, but also create a commission to investigate their deaths.
A small pot of money may help with the restoration of the site near the Cheltenham Youth Detention Center, which is managed by the state Department of Juvenile Services. The department applied this summer for a $31,000 grant to the African American Heritage Preservation Program to work on restoring the wooded area.
If the grant is approved later this year, the state may invest more money for “restoration and repair of the cemetery” in next fiscal year’s capital budget, according to a statement Tuesday evening from the Gov. Wes Moore’s office.
“Our history is our power and everyone shares responsibility in preserving and uplifting the countless stories of our state that have often gone unrecognized and unheralded,” said David Turner, the governor’s communications director. “We look forward to working with the General Assembly, our state agencies, local leaders, and community advocates on this project.”
‘Scandolous’
Work on a restoration project began with former Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who stepped down in June.
Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the department, who walked the woods with legislators on Tuesday, first visited the site last year. He later returned to look for any headstones with department staff, a volunteer genealogist and some youth from the nearby Cheltenham detention center.
Schindler said research revealed that the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children was opened around 1870, about 20 years after the House of Refuge was opened for juvenile offenders. But that facility, on the site of what is the current Charles Hickey School, was reserved for white children.
Schindler said the conditions at the House of Refuge for white children focused “on education and treatment.” He called the treatment of Black children at the House of Reformation “scandalous.”
He said there could be more headstones because some records are missing and death certificates were not issued in most parts of the state until 1898.

“It’s hard to find the words to describe how sad and outrageous it is,” said Schindler, who led caucus members through the site. “But we just don’t know how many more here.”
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) said the injustices of the past can still be seen today, in the treatment of youth who are automatically charged as adults for a number of crimes under Maryland law. It’s why he plans to reintroduce a bill that seeks to raise the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to age 16.
Smith’s bill also proposed for those 16 and younger charged with offenses such as first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving machine guns would be eligible to go to juvenile court.
“Even our predecessors in the General Assembly understood that youth should not be in adult prisons, except they just segregated them,” Smith said. “We are still going to restore and maintain this facility and this site, but what are the next steps?”
Del. Gary Simmons (D-Anne Arundel), who visited the site Tuesday, said he’s working on legislation to assess how the state can fund efforts to to identify and restore burial sites and cemeteries across the staet. Part of that would be through the state’s Office of Cemetery Oversight, which is under the Department of Labor.
“We have a tremendous amount of neglected cemeteries here in the state of Maryland,” he said. “We have all kind of different methods that we generate funds for the state. This is about community pride. We’ll get it done.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jared Littmann’s early lead in the Democratic primary for Annapolis mayor held, and even widened slightly, in an overwhelming win over longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, according to official results released Tuesday.
The final tallies showed Littmann, a local businessman, with 2,594 votes to 1,271 for Pindell Charles, who was seeking to become the city’s first elected Black mayor. That was similar to election night results from Sept. 16, but it took election officials another week to tally more than 1,700 mail-in and drop box ballots, more than 40% of the total cast in the race.
Littmann thanked family, volunteers, donors and voters for the win in a social media post after the final results were announced. The win has been a long time coming — he announced his candidacy in January 2024, and Pindell Charles joined the race last September.
Pindell Charles, a 12-year council veteran who has served as acting mayor on occasion, also thanked her volunteers and supporters in a Facebook post, and congratulated Littman on his win.
“Thanks to everyone who participated in the Primary Election. It is important to let your voice be heard with your vote,” her statement said. “Congratulations to Mr. Littmann. The voters have spoken. And I respect the will of the voters as well as the process.”

Littmann now faces Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election to succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms. O’Shea was unopposed in the Republican primary.
The city also had Democratic primary contests in four of the city’s eight wards, including the Ward 3 seat that opened after Pindell Charles decided to make a run for mayor. In that race, Keanuú Smith-Brown got 340 votes to 77 for Deborah “Debbie” Odum. Smith-Brown will face unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye in the general election.
The closest race was in Ward 4, another open seat after Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson declined to run for reelection. Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson edged Coren Makell by just four votes, 144 for Allsup-Johnson to 140 for Makell.
Despite the narrow margin, Makell on Tuesday congratulated Allsup-Johnson and all the other Democratic primary winners and pledged to “supporting you all in the general election.” Allsup-Johnson could run unopposed, as no Republican or unaffiliated voter had filed to run in that ward.
In the most-crowded race, incumbent Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley cruised to the nomination over four challengers, with 481 of the 942 votes cast. Other Democrats in the race were Katie McDermott who got 293 votes, Ron Gunzburger with 137, Genevieve Torri with 19 and Ben Bramsen with 12. Huntley faces Thomas Kriek, an unaffiliated candidate, in November.
In the only other contested primary, Diesha Contee got 185 votes to Craig Cussimanio’s 124 to win the Democratic nomination. Contee will face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DaJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jared-Littman-at-Seasalt-Annapolis-9-16-2025-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-09-23 23:56:51.778328

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle Lawyers for Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara and his family are asking a federal court to stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting him while he is in their custody.
Guevara’s lawyers, who include those from the American Civil Liberties Union, asked the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Georgia on Monday for his release and to halt any potential deportation after federal officials suddenly resurrected an older immigration case Friday. His lawyers also requested an emergency hearing and his release on Friday.
Guevara, a Salvadoran native who has lived in the United States since 2004, according to court documents, has been held in immigration detention since June 14, when he was arrested while livestreaming an anti-ICE protest in Atlanta. His misdemeanor charges were ultimately dropped but not before he was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
His arrest and continued detainment has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
The ACLU and Guevara’s family, including his children Katherine and Oscar Guevara, are calling for his immediate release, saying that his detention is illegal and a violation of his First Amendment rights.
“No one should have to face this fear of punishment for their free speech in this country. Still, we are holding on to hope that the government will do the right thing and release him at once. His place is with his family and his community, not behind bars or facing deportation,” Katherine Guevara said.

But a point of contention in the case is Guevara’s immigration history. In a statement, ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the “facts of this case have not changed. Mario Guevara is in the country illegally.” McLaughlin said Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012 but refused to leave and was subsequently given a “final order of removal from an immigration judge in 2012.”
Scarlet Kim, ACLU’s senior staff attorney, disagreed, calling ICE’s statement “incorrect.” According to Kim, while Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012, he appealed the decision. His case was then administratively closed, legally authorizing him to remain in the U.S. for the last 13 years.
“He never received a final order of removal,” Kim said in a statement.
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.
Kim said the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened the removal proceedings and reinstated the voluntary departure order Friday, giving Guevara 60 days to leave the country voluntarily. The ACLU argued in a court filing Monday that because he is in detention, ICE could undermine the voluntary departure order and deport him at any moment.
“This decision renders the Court’s intervention all the more urgent. Notwithstanding that Mr. Guevara was granted voluntary departure—which gives him 60 days to voluntarily leave the United States—the Government has offered no assurances that it will not put him on a plane back to El Salvador at any moment,” Guevara’s lawyers wrote in the filing.
First Amendment experts speaking at a press conference Tuesday said that the government’s actions against Guevara are part of a broader trend of suppressing free speech and intimidating journalists. Clare Norins, a law professor and director of the First Amendment Clinic at the University of Georgia, also representing Guevara, said that he is the only known journalist currently detained in the U.S. for his reporting. 
“Even though all the criminal charges against him were dropped, the government claimed that Mr. Guevara’s filming and reporting on police activity occurring in public made him a danger to the community. In other words, they continued to detain him for exercising his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and of the press,” Norins said.
ICE has previously disputed claims that Guevara’s detainment was connected to his reporting.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1906-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 22:57:09.262854

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)More than 25,000 Alaskans who buy health insurance through the federal marketplace will face massive and possibly unaffordable cost increases if federal subsidies expire at the end of the year.
“I do think it’s important to recognize that we should be seeing thousands of people likely lose coverage from this,” said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association.
In a panel discussion last month, local experts in Juneau laid out the stark reality for Alaska, which has the highest health care costs in the nation. 
Speaking to a room at Juneau’s convention center, they said if federal subsidies end, the cost of health insurance would rise so much that many Alaskans will go uninsured, discouraging them from getting checkups that could prevent serious illnesses. Hospitals would see a larger number of emergencies from uninsured people, straining them. It might even lead to an exodus from the state, as people seek alternative options and cheaper places to live. 
“I worry about that,” said Kim Champney, executive director of the Alaska Association on Developmental Disabilities. “Because I think people will decide to leave Alaska because we have the most expensive health care in the country.” 
Anton Rieselbach, with the Juneau Economic Development Council provided an analysis of cost estimates for Juneau. In Alaska’s capital city alone, 1,389 people receive health care via insurance plans bought through the federal marketplace. Right now, those Juneauites pay an average of $124 per month. If those subsidies expire, that will rise to $1,008 per month, an increase of more than 700%.
The council, a nonpartisan organization devoted to economic growth in the capital city, is worried about what will happen if the subsidies expire.   
“We want people to be working and spending money, generating economic activity,” Rieselbach said, “but this just places another huge burden on people’s ability to spend their money in other arenas besides health insurance.”
A problem years in the making
The upcoming problem stems from federal subsidies enacted by Congress in 2021 and extended through the end of 2025. Those subsidies, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” were applied on top of subsidies included in the original Affordable Care Act, which established the federal insurance marketplace.
Now, almost anyone who buys an individual health care plan through the marketplace gets some kind of subsidy.
Generally, that includes people whose employers don’t provide health insurance, self-employed people, and people who retired early and aren’t yet eligible for Medicare, which insures people with disabilities and people 65 or older. 
Subsidies helped expand the number of people on federal marketplace plans from 11.4 million in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, allowing millions of Americans to get regular health care.
They also came at a high cost to the federal treasury: Extending them for another 10 years would cost $335 billion. 
But if subsidies end, Alaska would be exceptionally hard-hit. The state has the highest health-care costs in the nation, which means unsubsidized insurance rates are high. 
Of the 28,736 Alaskans who have health insurance policies through the federal marketplace, 25,170 receive the enhanced subsidies, according to figures published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
If the enhanced subsidies expire, the poorest Alaskans will still see their plans subsidized. Middle-class Alaskans would be hard hit.
According to estimates published in March by the Alaska Division of Insurance, a single 50-year-old who earns $58,650 per year would see their monthly health insurance cost rise from $282 per month to $407 per month for a “silver” plan. If they have a “bronze” plan, their costs wouldn’t change.
But Alaskans who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty line — $78,000 per year for an individual — would see their costs skyrocket. 











In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.



That same 50-year-old would go from paying $534 per month for a silver plan to $1,415 per month. Under a bronze plan, their cost would go from $9 per month to $890 per month.
Lori Wing-Heier, the director of the Division of Insurance at the time of those estimates, called the increase “pretty horrific” for affected Alaskans. 
“It’s an insane amount,” said Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, talking about the increase.
This spring, Mina sponsored and the Alaska Legislature passed House Joint Resolution 9, a bipartisan letter asking Congress to extend the subsidies.
Across the state this year, the average monthly premium for Alaskans of all ages and all plans was $971.43, but the average subsidy was $866.28, the Division of Insurance said in March. 
Kosin, of the hospital and healthcare association, said his group thinks it’s “really important” to extend the enhanced subsidies. 
Insurance is based on the concept of sharing risks and costs. The more people in an insurance pool, the better it works. Subsidies encourage healthy people to be a part of the health insurance pool, he said. If people drop off, the cost of caring for any individual person is spread among fewer members, and rates go up.
An extension relies on congressional action
For the moment, Alaskans only have estimates of what will happen if the subsidies expire. Open enrollment on the federal insurance marketplace starts Nov. 1. There’s a “window shopping” period at the end of October that will give a sneak preview.
People must sign up by Dec. 15 to get insurance coverage that starts with the new year. Miss that deadline, and Jan. 15 is the deadline to get coverage that starts Feb. 1.
Kosin said he’s heard the argument that Alaskans could afford health care before the enhanced subsidies came into effect, and so there won’t be many people who drop their coverage.
That fails to take into account the way health insurance costs have gone up since 2020, he said.
In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
“If there truly is a doubling or tripling of premiums, especially at once, I think I would have to guess it would be a higher percentage than a fifth of the population that would consider themselves priced out of the market,” he said.
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski knows plenty of those people.
“If you are a 60-year-old couple (earning about) $82,000 in Alaska, you would be looking at a premium increase … without enhancements, of $44,556. My husband and I are over 60. Now, granted, we’re not on the exchange, but I have a lot of friends are in that category, and I don’t know very many of them that could swallow an additional $44,000 a year to pay for their insurance if they’re on the exchange,” she said in a Sept. 17 phone call.
Murkowski is among the members of the U.S. Senate who have been trying for months, without success so far, to find enough votes to extend the subsidies.
Impending government shutdown
The issue has now gotten entangled with the impending government shutdown. Senate Democrats have demanded — among other things — a permanent extension of the health care subsidies, without changes, in exchange for their votes on keeping the federal government open.
Sen. Dan Sullivan also supports an extension of the subsidies, but “there’s no way I would ever vote for that,” he said of the Democratic plan.
“I do think there’s bipartisan support to get this done. We’ve just got to power through these different issues,” he said by phone.
He identified three hurdles for the subsidies. 
“It’s how long you extend them; are there pay-fors (budget cuts to compensate for the cost of the extension) … but the most important and complicated — and we just did a deep dive on this, and I do think there’s bipartisan support on this, is reforms,” Sullivan said.
“We are looking at ways to reform the system to make it work for the people who need it and are using it honestly, but have a disincentive against those who have been abusing it,” he said.
“We’re getting there. It’s complicated. I think the reform piece is going to be the most complicated, but I’m hopeful, and I’m putting a lot of effort into it,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski is more interested in a straight extension without changes. She introduced a standalone two-year measure and voted against both Republican and Democratic proposals to keep the government open, saying one of her conditions was an extension of the subsidy.
Speaking by phone this month, Mina noted that an extension has the support of groups as far afield as the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce.
“I think if you’re directly on the insurance marketplace, you should be concerned. But also, if you care about economic diversification and startups, you should also be concerned,” she said.
If the marketplace doesn’t work, she noted, it would increase the costs of health care for everyone in the state because hospitals are required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. If people can’t pay, that means their costs get shifted to people who can, increasing the health insurance rates of everyone, not just those on the marketplace.
“What I fear is that we’re regressing to the state that we were in (a decade ago) when we had all of these news articles about people paying like, $800, $1,000 a month for their health insurance, and we were able to stabilize that and find solutions to help people,” Mina said. “We’re just going backwards in that regard.”

According to the study’s authors, South Dakota women are imprisoned at a rate of 338 per 100,000. That’s a higher rate than Montana or Idaho, in the second and third spots in the ranking of female incarceration rates. All three states have higher rates than El Salvador, the country with the highest incarceration rate.
The nationwide incarceration rate for women in the U.S. is 112 per 100,000. 
The report is titled “States of Women’s Incarceration: The Global Context 2025.” The Prison Policy Initiative built its rankings by looking at women incarcerated in prisons, jails and tribal jails.
The press release on the report notes that well over half the women imprisoned in South Dakota are held on drug charges or crimes. It also notes that the state voted in 2022 to build a new women’s prison in Rapid City to manage the overcrowded South Dakota Women’s Prison in Pierre. The new women’s prison is under construction at a cost of $87 million.
Female incarceration rates have declined in most states, the report says, but South Dakota’s rate has increased. According to a state data brief cited in the nonprofit’s report, the number of women incarcerated for violent crimes in the state increased 33% between 2013 and 2023. The number of female drug offenders grew by 66% in the same time period.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden pledged last week to create a rehabilitation and recidivism task force to study high rates of incarceration and repeat offenses.

(Congressional photo)Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany launched his campaign for governor Tuesday afternoon — becoming the third, and highest profile, candidate in the 2026 Republican primary. 
The 2026 race for governor in Wisconsin will be the first open election in over 15 years as Gov. Tony Evers decided to retire at the end of his second term. Two other Republicans are already in the race: Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien. 
“In 2026, Wisconsin will have a choice between opportunity, security, and freedom or following the path of failure seen in Minnesota and Illinois,” Tiffany said in a statement after officially launching his campaign on a conservative talk radio show hosted by Dan O’Donnell. “I will not allow our state to be dragged down that woke and broke road.”
Tiffany, who lives in Minocqua, had been teasing a run for governor for months and is expected to have an official launch event in Wausau on Wednesday evening.
The 67-year-old said in a statement that he would seek to “freeze property taxes, protect our farmland from Communist China, and fight every day for families, for farmers, and for the hardworking people who make this state great.”
In contrast to the short list of Republicans running so far, the Democratic primary field has become increasingly crowded in recent weeks. Official candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, who recently announced she would be stepping down from her position in the Evers administration. 
Tiffany was elected to represent Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, a massive area that encompasses the northern part of the state, in the House of Representatives in a special election in 2020. He took over from current U.S. Transportation Secretary and former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, who had resigned to care for his family.
Before going to Washington, D.C., Tiffany was in the state Legislature, first in the Wisconsin State Assembly for about three years, followed by nearly eight years in the state Senate. During his tenure, he served on the state’s Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state budget. Before that, Tiffany was the Town Supervisor of Little Rice and managed petroleum distribution for Zenker Oil Company.
Tiffany said that he could stay in Congress for much longer if he wanted to, but that he thinks he can do more as governor and is in the race to “uphold conservative principles.”
“It really is time for new leadership and I believe I have the vision to be able to lead the state of Wisconsin and make us one of the great states of America once again,” Tiffany said. 
In Congress, Tiffany is a member of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus and has been a consistent ally to President Donald Trump.Tiffany also supported attempts to overturn former President Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. So far this year, Tiffany has supported Trump’s tariffs and crack down on immigration, including targeting the H-1B visa program. 
“I support them,” Tiffany said of Trump’s tariffs in his interview with O’Donnell. “At the end of the day if the tariff regime is handled properly, we are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States of America.” 
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker criticized Tiffany in a statement, calling him “Tariff Lover Tom” and saying he “has been jacking up prices on Wisconsin families with his blind support for a trade war that is making everything from beer to beef to school supplies way more expensive — working Wisconsin families can’t afford Tariff Lover Tom being in charge.”
Tiffany said that he would also seek to uphold Wisconsin’s 20-week abortion ban. He has supported federal legislation in the past that would ban abortion at six weeks. 
“I do support that law, and I will uphold it as governor of the state of Wisconsin,” Tiffany said. “I think back to the debate that we had 10 years ago, and you had people on both sides. You had some that were, like, we want unlimited abortions. We had others that said there should be no abortions allowed in the state of Wisconsin, and ultimately, the people of the state said we really want to see something in the middle.”
Tiffany also said he would work to reduce taxes in Wisconsin, including freezing income taxes.  He didn’t commit to a flat income tax or eliminating the income tax as some Republicans have proposed.
“I also believe we can reduce income taxes. Can we take it down to zero? I don’t know the answer to that,” Tiffany said.

“If something is not done very quickly and substantially, I’m afraid people are going to go ahead and make decisions that they can’t change back,” Kirk Vansandt, the chief agriculture lending officer for Farmers and Merchants Bank, told a legislative panel in Stuttgart.
Tuesday’s hearing before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources subcommittee was the latest in a string of high-profile public meetings where members of the state’s agriculture community have exhorted Arkansas’ congressional delegation and President Donald Trump to come to the aid of commodity crop farmers, who are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand.
Without aid, many in the industry believe 25-40% of farmers will decide to bow out after this season, Vansandt told the panel. Arkansas led Southern states in the number of Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in 2024, according to a presentation shown to the subcommittee — and it’s already far surpassed its 2024 Chapter 12 totals in 2025.
“Personally, I think it’s one out of three people if nothing happens. It’s that dire,” Vansandt said.
Vansandt said his impression after a recent trip to the nation’s capital was that aid will come — but he worries it might not be soon enough.
A provision of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that passed earlier this year provided some assistance for farmers, but that aid isn’t set to hit bank accounts until fall of next year. Those addressing the subcommittee almost universally said that wouldn’t be soon enough to avert mass closures of farms.
“We’re in such a dire strait with our export markets,” Vansandt said. “It’s going to take a bridge to get us all from right now to the fall of ’26.”
The industry representatives stressed that it wouldn’t only be farmers who suffered if farms began to close en masse — so would the small rural communities they support, many of which have already lost large numbers of their populations in recent years. The businesses that support farms, like agricultural aviators, farm banks and parts stores, would also take a hit, they said.
Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbriar, asked what, if anything, the industry spokespersons wanted to see the state do to help.
“My concern is, if it’s just a money issue, for every dollar that we give y’all to help you weather the storm, that’s $1 we’re taking from another Arkansas family … that’s also struggling to put food on the table,” Meeks said. “We can’t print money like the federal government.”

Ross Wood, the retail operations manager for Stratton Seed, said help with taxes on capital expenditures or fuel would help.
“Taxes on parts and maintenance — that kills us,” Wood said. “Any help would help.”
Numerous people said they didn’t want handouts, but that they had become necessary in the face of a market that was not profitable. Vansandt put it bluntly: “That’s just not the world we’re living in right now.”
“Subsidies are going to be the only thing that can make up the difference,” he said.
The toll is not just financial. One farmer who was asked to speak, Sydney Robinett, said the stress of managing the downturn is the kind that doesn’t go away at the end of the work day.
“It gets in bed with you,” he said. “Sometimes it’s better to be awake than it is to sleep at night, because when I’m awake, I can think of what’s going on today. The bad dreams happen at night. The bad dreams are going out of business. The bad dreams are the uncertainty.”
Subcommittee Co-Chair Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, became emotional as she concluded the meeting. Noting her own job as a farmer, she said her heart broke for those struggling in the current commodity market.
“I’ve been saying for several weeks: February next year is way too late for us to forecast what this is going to do for our state,” Vaught said. “[By] November, we will have farms that have already made the decision to shut down, and they will never be able to go back into production again.”

(Screenshot courtesy of Arkansas Legislature live feed)Arkansas legislative leaders pressed state corrections officials Tuesday to acknowledge that a May prison escape resulted from systemic failures rather than solely the actions of two employees.
Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said the escape of a convicted murderer and rapist wouldn’t have happened had the two workers — a kitchen supervisor and a tower guard — done their jobs and followed policy. Those employees were fired shortly after Grant Hardin’s escape and recapture on June 2.
“Those two employees were the main characters,” Payne told Rep. Howard Beaty Jr., a Crossett Republican and co-chair of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions subcommittee.
Four other employees at the North Central Unit near Calico Rock have been suspended and one demoted since the escape, according to documents presented to the committee.
The documents included an extensive Arkansas State Police report detailing how Hardin, 56, escaped and breakdowns in communications and policy lapses. The 900-plus pages of the report include summaries of interviews with prison employees and supervisors and others involved in the 10-day search for the escapee.
Legislators focused on the policy lapses, including confusion over whether kitchen staff had been directed not to let any inmates out onto a kitchen loading dock without supervision. A standing written order that allowed kitchen workers assigned to cleaning duties to work on the dock — where Hardin had been — without supervision was superseded by a verbal directive just weeks before the escape, the state police report determined. But not all kitchen supervisors remembered hearing that specific command, the report noted.
There also was some confusion about who was responsible for alerting state police and other law enforcement agencies to the escape, which delayed notifications and quick action, according to the report.
“We definitely have some policy issues we have to work through,” Payne later told Sen. Ben Gilmore, a Crossett Republican who is the ALC’s co-chair.

Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace agreed that her department and prison administrators must address several policy issues raised by the state police report as well as the Division of Correction’s own internal incident review.
Republican Sen. Matt McKee of Pearcy, the subcommittee co-chair, said, “It sounds like everyone was confused out there that day. And that comes down to the leadership of the warden … So this isn’t just about two employees. This is a failure systemically because we didn’t have the training, we didn’t have the policies worked out.”
Payne, asked if he’d decided to discipline Warden Thomas Hurst, replied that he was still reviewing the matter.
Tuesday marked the third meeting since June at which the subcommittee heard testimony about Hardin’s escape and how prison staff and corrections leaders handled it and its aftermath.
The Division of Correction internal report noted that Hardin should have been classified as a high-security inmate rather than medium because of his dual convictions. His custody classification score had not been reviewed since October 2019, but even then his score should have made him ineligible for incarceration at the North Central Unit, the report said.
Rep. Jason Nazarenko, R-Cotter, asked Wallace what the Corrections Department was doing to fix the classification system to prevent inmates from being misclassified.
Although the classification system is automated, staff employees review them, Wallace noted. Department and correction division personnel policies, however, prevented the departmental supervisor from disciplining unit-level classification personnel who don’t follow her guidance, according to the internal report. The report recommends additional training for unit classification staff and more frequent review. 
Wallace said that her department is reviewing other policy changes that would “hopefully stem future problems.”
Department Chief Legal Counsel Tawnie Hughes told the panel she didn’t know how Hardin’s misclassification happened. When she tested the automated system, she said, she always got the number of points that should have sent to Hardin to a maximum security prison. He has been at the Varner Unit since his recapture.
“What we need is another set of human eyes … We’re working on a training system that will help,” she said.

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania is looking to join the multi-state lawsuit against the federal government over demands to share Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients’ data, potentially protecting $461 million in benefits for two million people across the state.
A hearing on adding Pennsylvania to the litigation is set for next week after the states filed a motion late Monday to add the commonwealth, according to court documents.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney issued a temporary restraining order last week blocking the federal Department of Agriculture (USDA) from collecting data on SNAP recipients and preventing the withholding of any funding until at least Oct. 9 in the 21 states and Washington, D.C., already part of the case, court documents show.
That would extend to Pennsylvania, too, if Chesney agrees to add the commonwealth.

USDA also has indicated it will withhold SNAP funding from Kansas because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly hasn’t complied with the federal data-sharing directive. Kelly’s office told The Kansas Reflector they’ll appeal that decision, but didn’t say whether her state would be joining the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the state’s Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach is suing Kelly and her Department of Human Services secretary over the issue.
Citing data security concerns, Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services (DHS) had been holding off on passing food stamp recipient information to the USDA. Hoa Pham, the state’s deputy secretary of Income Maintenance for DHS, told the federal agency as much at the July 30 deadline to set up data-sharing with the federal government.
A few weeks later, the Trump administration threatened to yank nearly half a billion dollars in SNAP support annually (nearly 11 percent of the total, equivalent to the state’s error rate) if the commonwealth didn’t comply by Sept. 19, according to WESA.

Instead, Pennsylvania officials submitted documents to USDA essentially declining to participate, claiming doing so risked violating federal law in light of the Sept. 18 order in the case the commonwealth now seeks to join, court documents show.
The controversy over SNAP beneficiary data has unfolded amid the onset of new qualification requirements that could eliminate benefits for 144,000 Pennsylvanians as well as looming cuts that could cost the state between $125 million and $800 million. Meanwhile, Medicaid has dealt with comparable turbulence over information seeking about recipients and changes to qualification standards.
USDA has said SNAP recipient information will help stem fraudulent use of program benefits. As part of that mitigation effort, the agency says law enforcement will have access to the database – and that’s provoked concerns that it will be used for other purposes as with Medicaid data handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The information sought includes names, addresses, social security numbers, occupation and education information, plus citizenship, immigration and marital status, according to USDA documents.

Wirth previewed his plans for the upcoming Oct. 1, 2025 special session to address impacts from federal policy on Medicaid, food assistance and vaccines. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico state Democratic leadership plans to bring forward at least four bills for the Oct.1 special legislative session — including one intended to insulate the state from federal changes to vaccination policies.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the session earlier this month and said it would be geared primarily at addressing impacts from the Congressional Republican spending bill signed into law by Trump this summer. The session start date coincides with a possible shutdown of the federal government. State Republicans have since pushed to expand the agenda to include topics such as interstate medical compacts, but have faced resistance from Senate Democrats.
However, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Tuesday that one of the bills that leadership intends to bring will allow the New Mexico Department of Health to “set their own standards.”
That move comes as U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. upends federal health policies.

“The federal standards are being thrown all over the place,” Wirth said. “As we go into COVID season and flu season, we’ve got to make sure vaccines are available based on the recommendations of our health folks, not tied to the federal standards.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter confirmed to Source NM in an email that vaccines will be on the agenda for the special session.
“We can confirm that it will be on the call,” she wrote. “But we don’t have the exact language yet.”
Additional bills, Wirth said, will include ones replacing a federal tax credit poised to end at the end of the calendar year; making changes to the state’s rural health care fund; and a general budget bill including money for state agencies and public media stations.
In his first interview with Source NM since  Sept. 11 bomb threats to his home and office, Wirth said no additional security measures will be in place for the upcoming session, noting the Roundhouse bans weapons and requires people to enter through metal detectors.
“I certainly feel safer here, and I know the public does as well,” Wirth said. “Having said that, though, this is a challenging time and we’re certainly gonna be vigilant. ”
Wirth also held firm in his opposition to adding medical compacts to the Oct. 1 session.
“I do support the medical compacts — I think that’s priority number one, and we’re going to get that done in January and work hard between now and then to make it happen,” Wirth said. “But it’s just not ready to go at this point in the special session.”
The exact timing for Oct. 1 special session  is variable, but he hopes to gavel out “in a couple of days.”
A closer look at the proposals
For the targeted tax credit, lawmakers would appropriate about $177 million in order to try to prevent rising health insurance costs from a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, Wirth said, which is also being debated at the federal level.
“We can try and hold New Mexicans harmless, and what I mean by that is keep them in the same place they would be if this tax credit weren’t being rolled back,” Wirth said.
The second bill would make some changes to the state’s Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund, established in 2023, and paying out $80 million between 2024 and 2026 for new services in counties with a population fewer than 100,000.
Wirth said the changes would allow for the fund to support current health care programs and allow for greater participation by removing the population limit.
“There’s lots of rural pockets and larger counties, and we want to make sure that those funds can be used for that rural health care,” he said.
Finally, the budget bill will include at least a $20 million appropriation to the New Mexico Health Care Authority for technology upgrades and to address the new federal requirements.
A variety of other appropriations remain that lack solid figures, Wirth said, including funds to address changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); additional behavioral health work in the courts; and funding for public television and radio stations after the federal cuts.
“What you’re going to see in this special session is us stepping up to make sure that the basic support net stays in place, especially when it comes to food and healthcare,” Wirth said.
The special session is only ”step one” and more priorities will be addressed in the regular January session, he said, such as juvenile justice and the medical compact questions.
“We’re going to be back in January for step two, and I think we’re going to be dealing with this in sessions for the next number of years to come,” he said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As buses hummed and beeped around Rhode Island’s central bus hub in Providence Tuesday evening, dozens wearing black and holding candles gathered to mourn an impending loss. 
The crowd was not mourning a person, but the state’s bus network. Sweeping cuts to its service set to take effect Saturday will radically transform the state’s public transit offerings, advocates say.
“Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today to say RIP to RIPTA as we know it,” Liza Burkin, board president of the Providence Streets Coalition, told over three dozen people assembled at Kennedy Plaza. 
Starting Sept. 27, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) will reduce service by cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 of its 67 lines — primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours. 
RIPTA board approves less drastic service cuts. But plan is no victory for bus riders.

Three routes will be eliminated on Saturdays, while another three will no longer run on Sundays or holidays. Four additional routes are being cut from weekends altogether, including the 68 line that links Newport’s North End with the city’s beaches — a service that is fare-free through the end of October.
“This is the Ocean State, and we’re cutting off access to the ocean for our working class on their days off,” Burkin said. “Shame.”
Even the agency’s top-performing route will not be spared. The R-Line — the state’s only rapid bus line which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket — will now run buses every 20 minutes on weekends instead of every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night.
The upcoming service changes resulted from an earlier, more extensive plan that had 58 routes facing cuts or reductions to try and stave off a $10 million budget deficit for the agency. That included the complete elimination of 11 routes and zones where riders book trips in advance. 
The agency’s board was scheduled to approve those deeper cuts Aug. 7, but postponed the decision after Gov. Dan McKee sent a last-minute letter asking the board to draft a less severe plan.
The result was a “budget framework” announced by McKee ahead of the RIPTA board of directors’ Aug. 28 meeting, where he offered $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds the agency would later have to pay back.
McKee’s office stands by this latest service adjustment, saying that reductions were based on demand data and post-pandemic ridership patterns.
“The governor’s agreement with RIPTA leadership puts the authority on a strong financial footing as we invest in projects like the new multimodal transit center to boost ridership and strengthen the agency — all while protecting taxpayers,” spokesperson Andrea Palagi said in an emailed statement.

While less drastic, advocates argue the upcoming changes will only harm RIPTA and the state in the long run. And if service gets worse, advocates will place blame squarely on McKee.
“Gov. McKee wants us to be grateful for the short-term and insufficient Band-Aids given to RIPTA because it could have been worse than his original proposal as though he is not the person responsible for putting us in this position in the first place,” Bove said.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January — a budget Bove called “callous and cruel.”
Lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, much to the dismay of McKee.
“How did the governor respond to that you might ask?” Bove posed to the crowd. “By throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to sign the budget like a middle-schooler not getting their way on the student council.”
That drew a laugh from McKee’s 2026 Democratic primary challenger, former CVS executive Helena Bounano Foulkes, who stood among the crowd. 
“This is his budget and budgets are choices — they represent our values,” Foulkes told Rhode Island Current after the rally. 
But for now, riders must contend with reduced service, though advocates remain hopeful the cuts can be reversed when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“So many of you have fought alongside us for so long and we have a lot more left in the tank,” Burkin said.

Rhoden was speaking in support of a proposed new men's prison in northeast Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — After 144 years, South Dakota lawmakers decided Tuesday it’s time for “the Hill” to retire.
The required two-thirds of each legislative chamber voted to endorse a 1,500-bed, $650 million replacement for the state penitentiary building that opened its doors when South Dakota was still Dakota Territory. The new prison will be the most expensive capital project ever funded by the state’s taxpayers.
The prison will be built in northeast Sioux Falls, on an undeveloped patch of industrial land near the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society. The location is about 3 miles northeast of the penitentiary, nicknamed “the Hill” for its perch overlooking the Big Sioux River.

The votes came during a one-day special session at the Capitol called by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden after a prison construction task force he created via executive order had recommended  a new prison with that size, price tag and location. The Senate approved the prison plan legislation 24-11, and the House approved it 51-18, with one House member, Rep. Jeff Bathke, R-Mitchell, excused while on a military deployment.
A previous men’s prison proposal with a higher price and a controversial location in rural Lincoln County, was presented in February during the regular legislative session and failed to earn the two-thirds support mandated for spending bills by the state constitution. 
Tuesday’s vote answers the most pressing and expensive question posed during a four-year saga on the future South Dakota’s prison facilities. In 2021, then-Gov. Kristi Noem commissioned a study of the Department of Corrections properties that concluded the state needed a new women’s prison — which is now under construction in Rapid City at a cost of $87 million — and that the oldest parts of the penitentiary had too many inmates and was unsafe for them and the staff. 
The state plans to pay for the new prison with cash. In 2022, lawmakers voted to begin putting millions in excess revenues, which ballooned thanks in part to federal cash infusions during the COVID-19 pandemic, into an incarceration construction fund that has since grown with further deposits and interest earnings. The next year, they approved the construction of the women’s prison.
The bill passed Tuesday transfers $78.7 million from the state’s budget reserves to the prison construction fund and authorizes the Department of Corrections to spend up to $650 million to build it. Most of the money is already in the fund, but about $42 million of the required funding is expected to come from future interest earnings.
Between 2024 and Tuesday’s vote, the state put $52 million into a plan to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison — at a price of $825 million, in that case — in southern Lincoln County. Lawmakers rejected that prison pitch in February, an act that spurred the creation of Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force. Last week, Rhoden’s office said much of that investment was recaptured by reusing designs on the $650 million version that did earn approval, but $21 million of the money spent on the Lincoln County site is unrecoverable.
The state shaved $175 million off the cost of the Sioux Falls prison plan by shrinking common areas within the facility and designing 300 of the beds as a barracks. Rhoden said the new plan does not reduce rehabilitation and vocational programming space. 
Questions on how to pay for the ongoing operations of the new prison will greet lawmakers when they return in January for their regular session. 
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko, who tendered an Oct. 20 resignation in a letter to Rhoden earlier this month in the face of criticism, told lawmakers earlier this year that it could cost the state up to $20 million more a year to run the new prison.
Two newer units on the grounds of the penitentiary in Sioux Falls will remain in service when the new building opens. That’s expected to happen in 2029.

Ian Calderon joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for governor. The former assemblymember left the Legislature in 2020 to focus on his family.


Former state lawmaker Ian Calderon is joining the crowded 2026 race for California governor, he announced Tuesday. 
The Whittier Democrat is framing his candidacy as one from a “new generation of leadership.” He was 27 when he became the first millennial to be elected to the state Assembly in 2012. 
But he was no newcomer even then — Calderon comes from a line of politicians from southeast Los Angeles County. His father, Charles Calderon, started the dynasty when he was elected to the Assembly in 1982. Two of his uncles also served in the Legislature — and federal prison for corruption. 
Ian Calderon left the Assembly, where he was majority leader, in 2020 to focus on his young family and his stepmother Lisa Calderon now holds his seat. But he’s been biding his time for a return.
In a campaign video that heavily features his wife and children, he said since leaving office he’s been “living in the real world, watching everyday life get harder for families like mine.” He highlighted the high costs of gas, child care and housing, taking particular aim at investment firms buying up properties. 
“The people running our government? They’re trying to use yesterday’s ideas to solve today’s problems and it isn’t working,” he said. 
He joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for the governorship, including: state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee, former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
Republicans Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County, and commentator Steve Hilton also are running.

They’ll have to do it cutting services, laying off workers, and making the most difficult call to moms, dads, sisters, and brothers and tell them, ‘Sorry, we can no longer provide services to your loved one.'”
The state House and the state Senate passed dueling health care funding bills this week. Without an agreement, neither bill can become law.

The state Department of Health and Services warned last month that if it did not receive an increase in Medicaid funding, it would cut payment rates to a broad range of health care providers beginning Oct. 1. 
The agency said Tuesday that without the additional money, it is prepared to reduce payments.
DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in an emailed statement that the legislature must act to approve the funds.
“Just like any household budget, we must make decisions based on the resources we know are available, not those we hope to receive,” his statement said.  “And under North Carolina law, the state is required to maintain a balanced budget, meaning we cannot spend money knowing we will run out well before the end of the fiscal year. Without legislative action, health care providers will see reduced payments and North Carolinians will see reduced access to care. It is time to stop delaying and do what is right for the people of North Carolina.”
The rate cuts will devastate patients and workers, said Rep. Grant Campbell (R-Cabarrus).
“There are health care providers all over the state that are already planning on layoffs, and some are deciding whether to continue seeing Medicaid patients at all,” he said.
The Senate passed its bill Monday. Senate leader Phil Berger said his chamber is done voting for the week. 
The House passed its bill unanimously on Tuesday. 
Both the House and Senate bills would increase funds going to cover increased Medicaid costs. The legislature approved $600 million in a stop-gap budget bill it passed in July, which DHHS said is not enough. Both the House and Senate bills increase that amount to $690 million, with more for Medicaid administration. 
The big sticking point is that the Senate included the final installment for a children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals in its bill while the House did not. 
House Republicans wanted a “clean bill” without the hospital money. The House Republican caucus is questioning the need to build a children’s hospital when the state already has them, and wants to take back the money that’s already been approved, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Lenior) told reporters.  
Duke Health and UNC Health have announced they will jointly run the hospital planned for Apex.

“Our members are asking questions of why is the state sending this money to two entities that already have a ton of it for a project the state may not necessarily need,” he said. “That’s part of our debate right now over the budget.”
The legislature has not passed a comprehensive budget that includes big items such as teacher and state employee raises. The budget year started July 1.
In a statement, Gov. Josh Stein lamented the lack of an agreement between the chambers. 
“With no agreement in sight to fully fund our Medicaid program, the General Assembly is closing off access to health care at a time when we need more,”  Stein’s  statement said. “Failure to act will lose us critical federal funding and take more than a billion dollars total out of our state’s health care system, needlessly hurting people’s health, health care providers, and our economy.”
Hall told reporters that DHHS does not have to cut rates next week. The legislature has already provided enough money to fund Medicaid into next year, he said.
Hall said Stein, a Democrat, is threatening Medicaid cuts for political reasons.
“It’s creating a fake crisis,” Hall said. “He certainly doesn’t have to do it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4763-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

Ned Lamont walks with New London Mayor Michael Passero, right, and state Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, toward a press conference to celebrate the resumtion of work on the Revolution Wind project. (Photo by John Moritz/ CT Mirror)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont took a victory lap in New London on Tuesday after a federal judge ordered work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, and he hinted that ongoing talks with the Trump administration could ease the path forward for both wind and fossil fuel projects in the region.
“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Lamont told reporters from a vantage point overlooking the staging area at the State Pier, which was jam-packed with sections of turbines ready to be loaded onto ships and taken out to sea for installation.
That installation work, which was shut down for nearly a month on the orders of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is slated to restart as soon as Wednesday, Lamont said.
“When these wind turbines are spinning in less than a year, it’s going to bring down the price of electricity, because it brings down peak pricing during the winter months, which is the most expensive time,” Lamont said. “This is a big deal for business, so it’s good.”
Lamont was joined in New London by his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, along with a throng of union workers and state and local officials to celebrate Monday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which lifted the stop-work order.
While the Trump administration may still appeal that decision, Lamberth did not stay his order — thus allowing work to resume immediately on the $6 billion project.
In a statement on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that Lamberth’s ruling “will not be the final say on the matter.”
“President Trump was elected with a resounding mandate to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,” Kelly said.
Rather than gloating on their initial victory, however, both Lamont and McKee offered a conciliatory note to President Donald J. Trump, saying they were engaged in conversations with administration officials about a broader energy strategy for the New England region.
“We’re working very closely with the Trump administration,” Lamont said. “We’re doing everything it can, not just right here [in New London] but what we can do to add on additional energy across our region. That’s all the above, from my point of view.”
Lamont has repeatedly touted his relationships with two Trump administration figures in particular: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He met with both officials during a visit to Washington, D.C., in February during which he expressed an interest in working with the federal government to secure permits for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure and state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.
The governor also noted that a purported deal between officials in New York and the federal government, which would allow the construction of new gas pipelines, was widely seen as necessary to spare another wind project — Empire Wind — from cancellation by the Trump administration.
But in his efforts to negotiate a similar deal to save Revolution Wind, Lamont said his overtures were repeatedly met with silence. “Show me the ransom note,” was how he characterized those talks to reporters last week, before the judge granted an injunction, allowing work to resume.
And while Lamont suggested some progress was made in talks held over the weekend, he confirmed on Tuesday that federal officials have not made any explicit request for Connecticut to approve natural gas pipelines in order to get them to lift their opposition to Revolution Wind.
Lamont’s willingness to strike a deal with the Trump administration involving an expansion of natural gas pipelines also risks alienating environmental advocates, who see gas as a costly and polluting source of power generation.
“I don’t think more natural gas is an ‘all of the above’ strategy,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound. “We’re full up on natural gas. You know, it’s by far the majority of what’s powering our electricity grid in the region. Here in Connecticut, we use an awful lot of it for home heating, and that creates a conflict. That’s a conflict, particularly with winter reliability, that offshore wind… is ideally designed to meet.”
Still, Rothenberger said he did not see much downside to officials like Lamont retaining “cordial” relationships with the Trump administration.
In addition to the soon-to-be-installed components of the Revolution Wind development that were stacked up on the State Pier Tuesday, equipment for the developers’ next project — the even larger Sunrise Wind, which will send power to New York — were being staged in preparation for offshore construction.
Asked whether he feared retaliation from the Trump administration targeting that project, Rhode Island’s McKee said the states would act similarly to protect workers and sources of clean energy.
“Those battles could come our way, but we’re prepared to fight them,” McKee said.

(Photo by Jodi Hilton/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island pressed the House Committee on Appropriations Tuesday to reject a provision in one of its fiscal year 2026 budget proposals that would rename the new Workforce Pell Grants to “Trump Grants.”
Workforce Pell Grants are a new category of Pell Grant, the federal government’s need-based financial aid program for college undergraduates. After years of bipartisan efforts to institute the grants for short-term training that prepares students for specific, high skill industries, the Workforce Pell grants were signed into law via President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in July. 
A provision in the house appropriations bill introduced on Sept. 11 — one that covers the upcoming fiscal year’s budgets for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education — would see the new grants renamed before they go into effect on July 1, 2026. 
The provision would not affect traditional Pell Grants, and the U.S. Senate’s equivalent of the House Appropriations bill lacks the “Trump Grants” provision. 
In a letter to Appropriations leadership, Amo and Magaziner argued the new nickname would erase the legacy of the late U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat and the namesake of the broader federal Pell Grant program which is often credited with scaffolding modern financial aid.  
“Preserving Senator Pell’s name on the program is not just about honoring the past, it is about protecting a future where every student, regardless of background, has the chance to dream big and achieve more,” the congressmen wrote. “To attempt to erase Senator Pell’s name from a program that has uplifted generations and replace it with a President whose record on education is defined by cuts and dismantlement is a profound insult to that legacy.”
Pell Grants began in 1972 when Pell led the charge to reform the Higher Education Act of 1965 and create Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, which were renamed in Pell’s honor in 1980. Pell Grants don’t require repayment and have a limited eligibility window. 
The new workforce grants carry the same conditions as other Pell offerings, and students cannot receive regular and workforce grants at the same time. The workforce grants — whose genesis goes back to 2014 with similar proposals in the JOBS Act by former Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu — are designed to subsidize students enrolled in accredited career-oriented programs that last between eight and 15 weeks. The OBBB defines eligible programs as ones offering instruction in “high-skill, high-wage” jobs or “in-demand industry sectors or occupations.”
Amo and Magaziner also took aim at the president’s venture into higher education, Trump University, which was open from 2005 to 2011 and was not an accredited university.
“It was not a university, it was not accredited, and it ultimately resulted in a $25 million settlement to resolve fraud claims brought by thousands of students who were misled by President Trump,” Amo and Magaziner wrote, adding that Trump’s higher ed effort “raise[s] questions about the appropriateness of associating the Trump name with a federal grant program designed to help working-class Americans achieve their higher education dreams.” 
“These grants should remain rooted in the legacy of Senator Pell, whose name symbolizes opportunity, integrity and the belief that education is the cornerstone of a strong democracy,” Amo and Magaziner wrote.

(Image via NPS)During the past two years, nonresident tourists visiting Montana spent an estimated $5.28 billion in the Treasure State annually, a roughly 9% decrease from the previous two years but one of the highest estimates on record.
That’s according to a new report by the Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR) at the University of Montana, which examined nonresident spending during 2023 and 2024. Compared to the last two-year study, covering 2022 and 2023, average annual nonresident spending at gas stations, local restaurants, hotels and other tourism-oriented businesses decreased by roughly $540 million.
The latest data release tracks with an earlier report this year that showed Montana welcomed an all-time record number of tourists in 2024 — by a million — but saw a roughly 10% decrease in how much money those tourists spent in state.
Among the state’s five designated tourism regions, Glacier Country, comprising the western portion of Montana, saw a two-year average of $1.8 billion in annual nonresident spending, accounting for a third of all traveler expenditures, holding its position at the top. Yellowstone Country, which includes Bozeman, Big Sky, and Red Lodge was next with $1.3 billion in average annual spending.
The institute has collected nonresident spending data since 2009, giving researchers a long dataset to observe trends in spending habits. 
“It’s a consistent method we’ve been using for a very long time,” Kara Grau, the report’s author, said. “I feel good about the history of this data.”
The data is collected through in-person interviews with travelers, as well as data from secondary sources. Grau notes that while there is high confidence in the state-wide estimates, the modeling estimates for the region and county-level data is drawing from increasingly smaller pools of data, so there is more variation year-to-year. 
In the 2022-2023 report, Glacier Country and Yellowstone Country accounted for 33.6% and 23.4% of the state’s nonresident spending respectively. In the latest report, those proportions held steady, with 33% and 25% respectively, while the southwest region ticked up from 15% to 17%. 
Among counties, Gallatin County saw the highest annual average of $887.3 million in spending, while Flathead County was close behind with $850.3 million, down 8% and 15% respectively.
“They seem to just jockey for first and second position each year,” Grau said. “They’re relatively close in spending. They both have the big national parks right in their vicinity. I think the visitation to those parks is a big contributor to which county jumps into the first or second place spot.”
In 2022, Yellowstone National Park’s northern entrance and the Livingston area saw catastrophic floods which closed portions of the road for months, leading to a drastic drop in visitation that year. Grau said some of the increased visitation to Gallatin County and the Yellowstone Country region in the latest report can be attributed to Yellowstone being reopened for the full season. 
Twenty-seven Montana counties drew at least $20 million in out-of-state tourism-related spending.

  Gas, guides and gambling 

Gas and diesel was the top spending category statewide as well as in four travel regions in Montana — Glacier and Yellowstone’s travel regions saw spending in restaurants and bars take the number-one spot.  The two categories combined for 40% of traveler spending, followed by lodging at 22%.
Retail sales, a $413 million category for visitors in 2023 and 2024, showed a decrease in the latest report, as did some categories that capture snapshots of discretionary or high-budget expenditures. 
According to ITRR, roughly 5% of out-of-state visitors hire outfitters and guides, which accounted for $412 million in visitor expenditures, while tourists spending money in casinos accounted for $27 million, both declines from the previous year.
 


“I do think in 2024 we saw a little less spending on the more flexible kinds of spending that travelers do, in terms of ‘I’ll spend more on groceries and less on going out to eat.’” Grau said, also highlighting the declines in retail and guiding services. 
One spending category that bucked the trend was money spent on Made in Montana products, a separate category from regular retail expenses for products carrying a Department of Commerce designation as locally sourced. The ITRR questionnaire didn’t ask about locally-sourced products in its first few iterations, but as the state has emphasized products made or grown in the state it has emerged as a profitable economic sector that keeps growing. 
Visitors spent an average of $184 million on Made in Montana products in 2023 and 2024, up more than $20 million from the previous years.

Electricity demand in western states is projected to increase 20% during the next decade — double what has been expected, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Monday.
“It’s clear we’ve got to meet this challenge head on to secure affordable, reliable energy for Montana families and businesses,” Gianforte said.
At their initial meeting Monday, the governor asked members of his newly formed energy task force to “dig deep, be creative, cast a wide net.” He asked the group to explore groundbreaking technologies for the state, including nuclear.
Gianforte created the Energy Advisory Council in a Sept. 10 executive order to provide him with short- and long-term recommendations to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy.
In general, Gianforte said he was tasking the group with providing “actionable” recommendations to “unleash American made energy.”
He said Montana has an “historic opportunity” to make progress with President Donald Trump back in the White House.
The task force, a group of 20 industry representatives, energy experts, large consumers, and legislators, asked how much more energy generation Montana needs, how much transmission capacity is available, and how to turn the page on “negative press” about data centers.
Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.
It has more energy capacity but less generation, with the closures of two coal fired plants at Colstrip and opening of “more variable resources,” such as wind, according to her presentation.
Data in the presentation said since 2019, wind capacity has increased 162% and wind generation has increased 93.6%.
But Nowakowski said demand is up even as generation is down — “We need to do something about that.”
And she said not much has changed with transmission in recent years.
Nowakowski said the group had significant expertise, it would have hard conversations during the next year, and she encouraged members to continually think about pushing the Treasure State forward.
“How can we make Montana first? I’m competitive. I want Montana to be first,” Nowakowski said.
She also said she wanted U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and others at the national level “to know Montana is ready and open for business.”
In response to a question from state Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, about whether reducing demand was part of the discussion, Nowakowski said “everything is on the table,” including energy efficiency.
“The cheapest electron is the one we save,” Nowakowski said.
Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.
The person said they thought the makeup of task force members leaned toward those who favored fossil fuels and asked the group to consider including representation from the Montana Environmental Information Center.
Nowakowski, however, said the group’s charge in making recommendations included “fuel neutrality,” and she said the governor also had promoted an “all of the above” strategy for energy.
She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.
The themes all three subgroups would consider are consumer perspectives, governance, regional markets, and best practices and innovation.
Gianforte said Montana already is a leader when it comes to energy resources and generation, and it’s ready to do more for producers and consumers, and for affordability and security.
“With our abundant resources and outstanding potential, Montana can and should play a key role in unleashing American energy,” Gianforte said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Tax Department estimates the state’s income tax collections will take a sizable hit as a result of federal tax legislation, though the impact will be smaller than in many other states.
Matt Peyerl, associate director of tax administration for the department, told lawmakers on Tuesday to expect an estimated $129 million reduction in individual and corporate tax income collections during the 2025-27 budget cycle due to the 10-year budget reconciliation law.
That equates to approximately 9% of the state’s individual and business income taxes and 2.5% of the state’s total tax and fee revenues collected in the 2023-25 biennium. 
The reduction in income tax collection is expected to decrease to $93 million in the 2027-29 biennium, according to the tax department’s estimates, before falling off to $26 million in the 2029-31 biennium when many of the changes expire. 
“A lot of the individual changes fall off after four years,” Peyerl said. 
That leaves a lot of uncertainty when trying to project farther than four years out because Congress could choose to extend the changes. Even estimates for the next few years are dependent on a lot of variables. 
“For now they’re the best I have,” Peyerl told members of the Legislature’s interim Tax Reform and Relief Advisory Committee. 
He said there will be some clarity on the impact to state revenues in summer 2026 once the majority of this year’s tax returns are filed. 
Peyerl noted the impact on North Dakota is anticipated to be less than more populous states with higher tax rates and a lower percentage of the population falling into a “zero bracket,” where they pay no income tax. In North Dakota, residents don’t pay state income tax if they make less than $48,475 for single filers, or $80,975 for married couples.  
Some states will see impacts from the federal legislation in the hundreds of millions or nearly $1 billion, Peyerl said.
For North Dakota, the largest impacts to individual income tax will come from the exemption for overtime pay, the increased standard deduction that applies to all filers, an additional $6,000 tax deduction for some senior citizens, and the deduction for auto loan interest payments up to $10,000. 
Business tax revenues will be reduced by restoring corporations’ pre-2023 ability to expense bonus depreciation, as well as research and development costs. 
While these changes were made at the federal level, and not by the North Dakota Legislature, it will nonetheless affect the state’s tax collections.
“North Dakota is entirely coupled, for better or for worse,” Peyerl said, with the federal government’s system.
That means North Dakota conforms to the federal Internal Revenue Code, including any changes made by the U.S. Congress, unless the state’s lawmakers pass a law stating otherwise. 
“Most of the states are in similar positions where to one extent or another they’re tied to the federal system,” Peyerl said. “Some are more completely tied. Some are tied in between.”
Not all federal tax legislation affects North Dakota’s tax collections. Changes to tax credits, for example, don’t have an effect on how much revenue North Dakota receives.

(Photo by Katrina Liebich/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Government does not have a good grasp on the federally-funded research needs for advancing U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That became clear to me when the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) recently published a new report that was intended to articulate those needs. In seeking alignment with the America First Agenda of the Trump Administration, USARC chose the wrong concept for our national interests. Perhaps inadvertently, USARC reduced our national interests to nothing more than our national safety and security interests. That is clear when one considers the terminology used throughout the report. Every priority area that USARC selected for Arctic research ends with the word “security” (e.g., military security). The Congressional committees of jurisdiction should resolutely reject the USARC findings in the months ahead. Otherwise, the U.S. Government will run the risk of prioritizing a set of research needs that do not fully advance the national interests of the Arctic, Alaskans and the American people.
Missing interests
One of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research along a single dimensional plane. There is no doubt that national safety and national security are two of the national interests at play in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only national interests. There is also  national survival, as well as national identity. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report not only overlooks the need for Arctic research on the preservation of the cultures, languages, history, and values of the Alaskans, especially Alaska Native peoples. It overlooks the need for Arctic research on the ability of the environment to meet the basic needs that ensure the enduring physical survival of Arctic communities.
Missing sectors
Another of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research around only three of the five sectors of security. It is clear that there are economic issues, military issues, and societal issues that have become securitized in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only securitized issues. There are political issues that have become securitized, like immigration. That is evident in the framing of unlawful migration as an “invasion” by the Trump Administration. There are also environmental issues that some Americans argue should be securitized. Examples include climate change, environmental degradation, and cross-border pollution. That is evident in the framing of climate change as an “existential threat” by the Biden Administration. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report did not explicitly address what, if any, needs there are for research on political and environmental security. That includes the need for research on Ukrainian refugees residing in the State of Alaska. Or the need for research on the environmental threats to certain Alaska Native villages that are now forced to relocate. The former is a particularly glaring omission given that U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) is on-the-record calling for the Trump Administration to do more to protect Ukrainian refugees.
National plan
The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), in cooperation with USARC, is in the process of developing a new multi-year national plan for Arctic research. That document will provide the guidelines that various federal agencies will use to determine where to invest their portion of federal funds to area studies, engineering, science, and technology research related to the Arctic. In order to advance U.S. national interests in Arctic affairs, the National Plan for Arctic Research (2027-2031) should avoid making the same mistakes as the USARC report. That will require doing a couple of things differently. First, it will need to account for each and every critical security issue that has an impact on U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That includes politically uncomfortable ones (e.g., environmental security issues). Second, it will need to articulate a set of priority areas that advance U.S. national interests – not simply U.S. national security interests. Otherwise, there will be major gaps in federally-funded research that will undermine U.S. national interests in the Arctic and beyond.
Alaska nexus
A large number of Arctic research institutions are based in the State of Alaska. This becomes immediately clear when one considers the member institutions of the soon to be shuttered Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS). They include the Alaska Ocean Observing System, Kawerak, Inc., Sitka Sound Science Center, University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of Alaska Southeast. These member institutions have been conducting Arctic research that not only improves our general understanding of Alaska and its communities. They have been producing research that has a tangible impact on the everyday lives of the people of Alaska. 
If the U.S. government decides to deprioritize federal funding of research on the stewardship of the Alaskan environment or community health for Alaskans, it could not only have a significant impact on livelihoods of Arctic researchers across the State of Alaska. That decision could have a significant impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Alaskan residents. That is why Alaskans should be questioning the Congressional delegation of Alaska and where they stand on oversight actions and the needs for Arctic research in the months ahead. Otherwise, they could miss the policy window that is now open to advance the interests of Alaska through Arctic research.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/32597688296_22a9433c96_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has canceled a report that hunger-fighting organizations say was “essential” data to see the results of federal and local policies aimed at ending hunger. 
USDA, in a news release about the decision said the reports were “redundant, costly, politicized” and did “nothing more than fear monger.”
Paige Chickering, vice chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said agencies like hers, along with researchers and even politicians, used the now-canceled report to analyze the impact of certain policies on food insecurity. Chickering said the announced cancellation of the report coincides with the “largest cut” to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“That can’t just be coincidence,” Chickering said. “That seems very intentional, because it is very likely that the cuts will make it harder for Americans, and Iowans, to access their grocery benefits, and we will very likely see that in the data about food security – except now we won’t, because it’s no longer being collected.”

The Republican-led budget reconciliation law,  enacted July 4 and known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” included significant cuts to the SNAP program. 
According to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the law cut $187 billion, or about 20%, of federal funding to SNAP through 2034.  CBO said the law “takes away food assistance” via its changes to the Thrifty Food Plan, requirements for some states to provide matching funds, expanded work requirements and changes to eligibility based on immigration status. The CBO report estimates 4 million people that rely on SNAP will see their food assistance terminated, or reduced substantially. 
The Iowa Hunger Coalition estimates the changes to the program from the new law will result in a loss of nearly $50 million in funding to SNAP in Iowa in 2026. By 2034, the loss of funding per fiscal year will be more than $200 million, according to the coalition. 
“Millions of American children are facing food insecurity, and willfully neglecting that fact, and preventing the federal government from collecting and reporting the data that tells us how many kids are impacted is frankly unacceptable,” said Chickering, who is also the Iowa state manager for the Save the Children Action Network.
What is the Household Food Security Report?
The USDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Center for Health Statistics partnered in the 1990s to create a supplement to the Current Population Survey, known as the CPS Food Security Supplement. 
This supplement, which has been issued annually since 1995, gathers data for a national measure of food security. Data from the report is used to generate Household Food Security Reports.
According to the news release from USDA announcing the termination of the project, the study was initiated under the Clinton administration as a “means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotments.” 
USDA called the survey “redundant” in the release and said it “failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.” 
The food security survey is one of several elements used by Feeding America, a national organization of food banks, pantries and meal programs, for its reports on hunger in America. The latest report shows 47 million people in the nation face food insecurity, and that 1 in 5 children is food insecure. 
Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America’s CEO, said in a statement that the loss of the survey “will create gaps.” Babineaux-Fontenot said while the survey was never a “a perfect resource,” it has revealed trends and highlighted the experiences of children and households experiencing food insecurity.
“They helped us to see that food insecurity touches every county in every state and that the deepest challenges are often in rural counties,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
She said the report also showed when certain issues like the “staggering inflation” of 2022 left people “reeling” or when policies, like the investments into nutrient-dense local foods in late 2020, had positive outcomes on food security rates and health outcomes. 
“While neither the USDA report nor any single report that is created will be perfect, these efforts help ensure the information we collect and act on is as accurate and useful as possible,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
“As USDA’s report sunsets, there is a risk of losing consistent national benchmarks that have helped guide solutions. Feeding America is committed to working alongside partners to ensure we continue building on that foundation.” 
USDA said in its release that “trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged” despite increases to SNAP spending from 2019-2023. 
Chickering said that claim is “not true” and cited Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap study which shows food insecurity rates nationally have increased more than 3% in the last two years. 
“They’ve not remained the same; they are actually on the rise,” Chickering said. “And then we also see strong anecdotal evidence of this as well when we talk about what food banks and food pantries are experiencing … they’re experiencing higher and higher demand.” 
USDA’s own survey results from September 2024, reflecting 2023 data from the survey, also show a sharp increase in food insecurity rates from 2021 to 2023.

Share Our Strength, another organization that uses the food security data with its No Kid Hungry campaign, said Americans should be “deeply concerned” about the elimination of the survey.
Anne Filipic, the organization’s CEO, said in a statement the data has been used to “illuminate how policy decisions impact how children and families across America experience hunger.” 
“By helping policymakers and advocates understand the impact policy decisions and the economy have on hunger trends, this research helps ensure we’re wisely investing taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively on programs that work to end hunger,” Filipic said in a statement.
Chickering said the announcement from USDA insinuates the report is “costing American taxpayers a ton of money” which she said is misleading since the survey is a supplement to the existing Current Population Survey. 
“We get a ton of data out of this report that’s foundational to the study of food insecurity in our country at a very low cost to the government,” Chickering said.

Josh Shapiro.","Constellation Energy's Limerick Generating Station, branded as the Limerick Clean Energy Center, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The organization that manages the electric grid for all or part of 13 states, including Maryland, has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.
Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.
“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.
He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.
“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.
“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”
Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.
“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.
PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.
It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.
The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box, because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret.
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.
“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.
“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.
PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.
Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.
“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.
“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policymaking things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”
Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.

“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”
What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.
Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.
“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.
Maryland State Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create.
“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.
“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”
